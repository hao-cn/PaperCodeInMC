Gen  At the first God made the heaven and the earth
Gen  And the earth was waste and without form and it was dark on the face of the deep and the Spirit of God was moving on the face of the waters
Gen  And God said Let there be light and there was light
Gen  And God looking on the light saw that it was good and God made a division between the light and the dark
Gen  Naming the light Day and the dark Night And there was evening and there was morning the first day
Gen  And God said Let there be a solid arch stretching over the waters parting the waters from the waters
Gen  And God made the arch for a division between the waters which were under the arch and those which were over it and it was so
Gen  And God gave the arch the name of Heaven And there was evening and there was morning the second day
Gen  And God said Let the waters under the heaven come together in one place and let the dry land be seen and it was so
Gen  And God gave the dry land the name of Earth and the waters together in their place were named Seas and God saw that it was good
Gen  And God said Let grass come up on the earth and plants producing seed and fruittrees giving fruit in which is their seed after their sort and it was so
Gen  And grass came up on the earth and every plant producing seed of its sort and every tree producing fruit in which is its seed of its sort and God saw that it was good
Gen  And there was evening and there was morning the third day
Gen  And God said Let there be lights in the arch of heaven for a division between the day and the night and let them be for signs and for marking the changes of the year and for days and for years
Gen  And let them be for lights in the arch of heaven to give light on the earth and it was so
Gen  And God made the two great lights the greater light to be the ruler of the day and the smaller light to be the ruler of the night and he made the stars
Gen  And God put them in the arch of heaven to give light on the earth
Gen  To have rule over the day and the night and for a division between the light and the dark and God saw that it was good
Gen  And there was evening and there was morning the fourth day
Gen  And God said Let the waters be full of living things and let birds be in flight over the earth under the arch of heaven
Gen  And God made great seabeasts and every sort of living and moving thing with which the waters were full and every sort of winged bird and God saw that it was good
Gen  And God gave them his blessing saying Be fertile and have increase making all the waters of the seas full and let the birds be increased in the earth
Gen  And there was evening and there was morning the fifth day
Gen  And God said Let the earth give birth to all sorts of living things cattle and all things moving on the earth and beasts of the earth after their sort and it was so
Gen  And God made the beast of the earth after its sort and the cattle after their sort and everything moving on the face of the earth after its sort and God saw that it was good
Gen  And God said Let us make man in our image like us and let him have rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every living thing which goes flat on the earth
Gen  And God made man in his image in the image of God he made him male and female he made them
Gen  And God gave them his blessing and said to them Be fertile and have increase and make the earth full and be masters of it be rulers over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing moving on the earth
Gen  And God said See I have given you every plant producing seed on the face of all the earth and every tree which has fruit producing seed they will be for your food
Gen  And to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the air and every living thing moving on the face of the earth I have given every green plant for food and it was so
Gen  And God saw everything which he had made and it was very good And there was evening and there was morning the sixth day
Gen  And the heaven and the earth and all things in them were complete
Gen  And on the seventh day God came to the end of all his work and on the seventh day he took his rest from all the work which he had done
Gen  And God gave his blessing to the seventh day and made it holy because on that day he took his rest from all the work which he had made and done
Gen  These are the generations of the heaven and the earth when they were made
Gen  In the day when the Lord God made earth and heaven there were no plants of the field on the earth and no grass had come up for the Lord God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no man to do work on the land
Gen  But a mist went up from the earth watering all the face of the land
Gen  And the Lord God made man from the dust of the earth breathing into him the breath of life and man became a living soul
Gen  And the Lord God made a garden in the east in Eden and there he put the man whom he had made
Gen  And out of the earth the Lord made every tree to come delighting the eye and good for food and in the middle of the garden the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
Gen  And a river went out of Eden giving water to the garden and from there it was parted and became four streams
Gen  The name of the first is Pishon which goes round about all the land of Havilah where there is gold
Gen  And the gold of that land is good there is bdellium and the onyx stone
Gen  And the name of the second river is Gihon this river goes round all the land of Cush
Gen  And the name of the third river is Tigris which goes to the east of Assyria And the fourth river is Euphrates
Gen  And the Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to do work in it and take care of it
Gen  And the Lord God gave the man orders saying You may freely take of the fruit of every tree of the garden
Gen  But of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you may not take for on the day when you take of it death will certainly come to you
Gen  And the Lord God said It is not good for the man to be by himself I will make one like himself as a help to him
Gen  And from the earth the Lord God made every beast of the field and every bird of the air and took them to the man to see what names he would give them and whatever name he gave to any living thing that was its name
Gen  And the man gave names to all cattle and to the birds of the air and to every beast of the field but Adam had no one like himself as a help
Gen  And the Lord God sent a deep sleep on the man and took one of the bones from his side while he was sleeping joining up the flesh again in its place
Gen  And the bone which the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman and took her to the man
Gen  And the man said This is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh let her name be Woman because she was taken out of Man
Gen  For this cause will a man go away from his father and his mother and be joined to his wife and they will be one flesh
Gen  And the man and his wife were without clothing and they had no sense of shame
Gen  Now the snake was wiser than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made And he said to the woman Has God truly said that you may not take of the fruit of any tree in the garden
Gen  And the woman said We may take of the fruit of the trees in the garden
Gen  But of the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden God has said If you take of it or put your hands on it death will come to you
Gen  And the snake said Death will not certainly come to you
Gen  For God sees that on the day when you take of its fruit your eyes will be open and you will be as gods having knowledge of good and evil
Gen  And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and a delight to the eyes and to be desired to make one wise she took of its fruit and gave it to her husband
Gen  And their eyes were open and they were conscious that they had no clothing and they made themselves coats of leaves stitched together
Gen  And there came to them the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the evening wind and the man and his wife went to a secret place among the trees of the garden away from the eyes of the Lord God
Gen  And the voice of the Lord God came to the man saying Where are you
Gen  And he said Hearing your voice in the garden I was full of fear because I was without clothing and I kept myself from your eyes
Gen  And he said Who gave you the knowledge that you were without clothing Have you taken of the fruit of the tree which I said you were not to take
Gen  And the man said The woman whom you gave to be with me she gave me the fruit of the tree and I took it
Gen  And the Lord God said to the woman What have you done And the woman said I was tricked by the deceit of the snake and I took it
Gen  And the Lord God said to the snake Because you have done this you are cursed more than all cattle and every beast of the field you will go flat on the earth and dust will be your food all the days of your life
Gen  And there will be war between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed by him will your head be crushed and by you his foot will be wounded
Gen  To the woman he said Great will be your pain in childbirth in sorrow will your children come to birth still your desire will be for your husband but he will be your master
Gen  And to Adam he said Because you gave ear to the voice of your wife and took of the fruit of the tree which I said you were not to take the earth is cursed on your account in pain you will get your food from it all your life
Gen  Thorns and waste plants will come up and the plants of the field will be your food
Gen  With the hard work of your hands you will get your bread till you go back to the earth from which you were taken for dust you are and to the dust you will go back
Gen  And the man gave his wife the name of Eve because she was the mother of all who have life
Gen  And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins for their clothing
Gen  And the Lord God said Now the man has become like one of us having knowledge of good and evil and now if he puts out his hand and takes of the fruit of the tree of life he will go on living for ever
Gen  So the Lord God sent him out of the garden of Eden to be a worker on the earth from which he was taken
Gen  So he sent the man out and at the east of the garden of Eden he put winged ones and a flaming sword turning every way to keep the way to the tree of life
Gen  And the man had connection with Eve his wife and she became with child and gave birth to Cain and said I have got a man from the Lord
Gen  Then again she became with child and gave birth to Abel his brother And Abel was a keeper of sheep but Cain was a farmer
Gen  And after a time Cain gave to the Lord an offering of the fruits of the earth
Gen  And Abel gave an offering of the young lambs of his flock and of their fat And the Lord was pleased with Abels offering
Gen  But in Cain and his offering he had no pleasure And Cain was angry and his face became sad
Gen  And the Lord said to Cain Why are you angry and why is your face sad
Gen  If you do well will you not have honour and if you do wrong sin is waiting at the door desiring to have you but do not let it be your master
Gen  And Cain said to his brother Let us go into the field and when they were in the field Cain made an attack on his brother Abel and put him to death
Gen  And the Lord said to Cain Where is your brother Abel And he said I have no idea am I my brothers keeper
Gen  And he said What have you done the voice of your brothers blood is crying to me from the earth
Gen  And now you are cursed from the earth whose mouth is open to take your brothers blood from your hand
Gen  No longer will the earth give you her fruit as the reward of your work you will be a wanderer in flight over the earth
Gen  And Cain said My punishment is greater than my strength
Gen  You have sent me out this day from the face of the earth and from before your face I will be a wanderer in flight over the earth and whoever sees me will put me to death
Gen  And the Lord said Truly if Cain is put to death seven lives will be taken for his And the Lord put a mark on Cain so that no one might put him to death
Gen  And Cain went away from before the face of the Lord and made his livingplace in the land of Nod on the east of Eden
Gen  And Cain had connection with his wife and she became with child and gave birth to Enoch and he made a town and gave the town the name of Enoch after his son
Gen  And Enoch had a son Irad and Irad became the father of Mehujael and Mehujael became the father of Methushael and Methushael became the father of Lamech
Gen  And Lamech had two wives the name of the one was Adah and the name of the other Zillah
Gen  And Adah gave birth to Jabal he was the father of such as are living in tents and keep cattle
Gen  And his brothers name was Jubal he was the father of all players on instruments of music
Gen  And Zillah gave birth to Tubalcain who is the father of every maker of cutting instruments of brass and iron and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah
Gen  And Lamech said to his wives Adah and Zillah give ear to my voice you wives of Lamech give attention to my words for I would put a man to death for a wound and a young man for a blow
Gen  If seven lives are to be taken as punishment for Cains death seventyseven will be taken for Lamechs
Gen  And Adam had connection with his wife again and she gave birth to a son to whom she gave the name of Seth for she said God has given me another seed in place of Abel whom Cain put to death
Gen  And Seth had a son and he gave him the name of Enosh at this time men first made use of the name of the Lord in worship
Gen  This is the book of the generations of Adam In the day when God made man he made him in the image of God
Gen  Male and female he made them naming them Man and giving them his blessing on the day when they were made
Gen  Adam had been living for a hundred and thirty years when he had a son like himself after his image and gave him the name of Seth
Gen  And after the birth of Seth Adam went on living for eight hundred years and had sons and daughters
Gen  And all the years of Adams life were nine hundred and thirty and he came to his end
Gen  And Seth was a hundred and five years old when he became the father of Enosh

Gen  And all the years of Enosh were nine hundred and five and he came to his end
Gen  And Kenan was seventy years old when he became the father of Mahalalel
Gen  And after the birth of Mahalalel Kenan went on living for eight hundred and forty years and had sons and daughters

Gen  And after the birth of Methuselah Enoch went on in Gods ways for three hundred years and had sons and daughters
Gen  And all the years of Enochs life were three hundred and sixtyfive
Gen  And Enoch went on in Gods ways and he was not seen again for God took him
Gen  And Methuselah was a hundred and eightyseven years old when he became the father of Lamech
Gen  And after the birth of Lamech Methuselah went on living for seven hundred and eightytwo years and had sons and daughters
Gen  And all the years of Methuselahs life were nine hundred and sixtynine and he came to his end
Gen  And Lamech was a hundred and eightytwo years old when he had a son
Gen  And he gave him the name of Noah saying Truly he will give us rest from our trouble and the hard work of our hands because of the earth which was cursed by God
Gen  And after the birth of Noah Lamech went on living for five hundred and ninetyfive years and had sons and daughters
Gen  And all the years of Lamechs life were seven hundred and seventyseven and he came to his end
Gen  And when Noah was five hundred years old he became the father of Shem Ham and Japheth
Gen  And after a time when men were increasing on the earth and had daughters
Gen  The sons of God saw that the daughters of men were fair and they took wives for themselves from those who were pleasing to them
Gen  And the Lord said My spirit will not be in man for ever for he is only flesh so the days of his life will be a hundred and twenty years
Gen  There were men of great strength and size on the earth in those days and after that when the sons of God had connection with the daughters of men they gave birth to children these were the great men of old days the men of great name
Gen  And the Lord saw that the sin of man was great on the earth and that all the thoughts of his heart were evil
Gen  And the Lord had sorrow because he had made man on the earth and grief was in his heart
Gen  And the Lord said I will take away man whom I have made from the face of the earth even man and beast and that which goes on the earth and every bird of the air for I have sorrow for having made them
Gen  But Noah had grace in the eyes of God
Gen  These are the generations of Noah Noah was an upright man and without sin in his generation he went in the ways of God
Gen  And Noah had three sons Shem Ham and Japheth
Gen  And the earth was evil in Gods eyes and full of violent ways
Gen  And God looking on the earth saw that it was evil for the way of all flesh had become evil on the earth
Gen  And God said to Noah The end of all flesh has come the earth is full of their violent doings and now I will put an end to them with the earth
Gen  Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood with rooms in it and make it safe from the water inside and out
Gen  And this is the way you are to make it it is to be three hundred cubits long fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high
Gen  You are to put a window in the ark a cubit from the roof and a door in the side of it and you are to make it with a lower and second and third floors
Gen  For truly I will send a great flow of waters over the earth for the destruction from under the heaven of all flesh in which is the breath of life everything on the earth will come to an end
Gen  But with you I will make an agreement and you will come into the ark you and your sons and your wife and your sons wives with you
Gen  And you will take with you into the ark two of every sort of living thing and keep them safe with you they will be male and female
Gen  Two of every sort of bird and cattle and of every sort of living thing which goes on the earth will you take with you to keep them from destruction
Gen  And make a store of every sort of food for yourself and them
Gen  And all these things Noah did as God said so he did
Gen  And the Lord said to Noah Take all your family and go into the ark for you only in this generation have I seen to be upright
Gen  Of every clean beast you will take seven males and seven females and of the beasts which are not clean two the male and his female
Gen  And of the birds of the air seven males and seven females so that their seed may still be living on the face of the earth
Gen  For after seven days I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights for the destruction of every living thing which I have made on the face of the earth
Gen  And Noah did everything which the Lord said he was to do
Gen  And Noah was six hundred years old when the waters came flowing over all the earth
Gen  And Noah with his sons and his wife and his sons wives went into the ark because of the flowing of the waters
Gen  Of clean beasts and of beasts which are not clean and of birds and of everything which goes on the earth
Gen  In twos male and female they went into the ark with Noah as God had said
Gen  And after the seven days the waters came over all the earth
Gen  In the six hundredth year of Noahs life in the second month on the seventeenth day of the month all the fountains of the great deep came bursting through and the windows of heaven were open
Gen  And rain came down on the earth for forty days and forty nights
Gen  On the same day Noah with Shem Ham and Japheth his sons and his wife and his sons wives went into the ark
Gen  And with them every sort of beast and cattle and every sort of thing which goes on the earth and every sort of bird
Gen  They went with Noah into the ark two and two of all flesh in which is the breath of life
Gen  Male and female of all flesh went in as God had said and the ark was shut by the Lord
Gen  And for forty days the waters were over all the earth and the waters were increased so that the ark was lifted up high over the earth
Gen  And the waters overcame everything and were increased greatly on the earth and the ark was resting on the face of the waters
Gen  And the waters overcame everything on the earth and all the mountains under heaven were covered
Gen  The waters went fifteen cubits higher till all the mountains were covered
Gen  And destruction came on every living thing moving on the earth birds and cattle and beasts and everything which went on the earth and every man
Gen  Everything on the dry land in which was the breath of life came to its end
Gen  Every living thing on the face of all the earth man and cattle and things moving on the face of the earth and birds of the air came to destruction only Noah and those who were with him in the ark were kept from death
Gen  And the waters were over the earth a hundred and fifty days
Gen  And God kept Noah in mind and all the living things and the cattle which were with him in the ark and God sent a wind over the earth and the waters went down
Gen  And the fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven were shut and the rain from heaven was stopped
Gen  And the waters went slowly back from the earth and at the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters were lower
Gen  And on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat
Gen  And still the waters went on falling till on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains were seen
Gen  Then after forty days through the open window of the ark which he had made
Gen  Noah sent out a raven which went this way and that till the waters were gone from the earth
Gen  And he sent out a dove to see if the waters had gone from the face of the earth
Gen  But the dove saw no restingplace for her foot and came back to the ark for the waters were still over all the earth and he put out his hand and took her into the ark
Gen  And after waiting another seven days he sent the dove out again
Gen  And the dove came back at evening and in her mouth was an oliveleaf broken off so Noah was certain that the waters had gone down on the earth
Gen  And after seven days more he sent the dove out again but she did not come back to him
Gen  And in the six hundred and first year on the first day of the first month the waters were dry on the earth and Noah took the cover off the ark and saw that the face of the earth was dry
Gen  And on the twentyseventh day of the second month the earth was dry
Gen  And God said to Noah
Gen  Go out of the ark you and your wife and your sons and your sons wives
Gen  Take out with you every living thing which is with you birds and cattle and everything which goes on the earth so that they may have offspring and be fertile and be increased on the earth
Gen  And Noah went out with his sons and his wife and his sons wives
Gen  And every beast and bird and every living thing of every sort which goes on the earth went out of the ark
Gen  And Noah made an altar to the Lord and from every clean beast and bird he made burned offerings on the altar
Gen  And when the sweet smell came up to the Lord he said in his heart I will not again put a curse on the earth because of man for the thoughts of mans heart are evil from his earliest days never again will I send destruction on all living things as I have done
Gen  While the earth goes on seed time and the getting in of the grain cold and heat summer and winter day and night will not come to an end
Gen  And God gave his blessing to Noah and his sons and said Be fertile and have increase and make the earth full
Gen  And the fear of you will be strong in every beast of the earth and every bird of the air everything which goes on the land and all the fishes of the sea are given into your hands
Gen  Every living and moving thing will be food for you I give them all to you as before I gave you all green things
Gen  But flesh with the lifeblood in it you may not take for food
Gen  And for your blood which is your life will I take payment from every beast I will take it and from every man will I take payment for the blood of his brotherman
Gen  Whoever takes a mans life by man will his life be taken because God made man in his image
Gen  And now be fertile and have increase have offspring on the earth and become great in number
Gen  And God said to Noah and to his sons
Gen  Truly I will make my agreement with you and with your seed after you
Gen  And with every living thing with you all birds and cattle and every beast of the earth which comes out of the ark with you
Gen  And I will make my agreement with you never again will all flesh be cut off by the waters never again will the waters come over all the earth for its destruction
Gen  And God said This is the sign of the agreement which I make between me and you and every living thing with you for all future generations
Gen  I will put my bow in the cloud and it will be for a sign of the agreement between me and the earth
Gen  And whenever I make a cloud come over the earth the bow will be seen in the cloud
Gen  And I will keep in mind the agreement between me and you and every living thing and never again will there be a great flow of waters causing destruction to all flesh
Gen  And the bow will be in the cloud and looking on it I will keep in mind the eternal agreement between God and every living thing on the earth
Gen  And God said to Noah This is the sign of the agreement which I have made between me and all flesh on the earth
Gen  And the sons of Noah who went out of the ark were Shem Ham and Japheth and Ham is the father of Canaan
Gen  These three were the sons of Noah and from them all the earth was peopled
Gen  In those days Noah became a farmer and he made a vinegarden
Gen  And he took of the wine of it and was overcome by drink and he was uncovered in his tent
Gen  And Ham the father of Canaan saw his father unclothed and gave news of it to his two brothers outside
Gen  And Shem and Japheth took a robe and putting it on their backs went in with their faces turned away and put it over their father so that they might not see him unclothed
Gen  And awaking from his wine Noah saw what his youngest son had done to him and he said
Gen  Cursed be Canaan let him be a servant of servants to his brothers
Gen  And he said Praise to the Lord the God of Shem let Canaan be his servant
Gen  May God make Japheth great and let his livingplace be in the tents of Shem and let Canaan be his servant
Gen  And Noah went on living three hundred and fifty years after the great flow of waters
Gen  all the years of his life were nine hundred and fifty and he came to his end
Gen  Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah Shem Ham and Japheth these are the sons which they had after the great flow of waters

Gen  And at the first his kingdom was Babel and Erech and Accad and Calneh in the land of Shinar

Gen  These are the families of the sons of Noah in the order of their generations and their nations from these came all the nations of the earth after the great flow of waters
Gen  And all the earth had one language and one tongue
Gen  And it came about that in their wandering from the east they came to a stretch of flat country in the land of Shinar and there they made their livingplace
Gen  And they said one to another Come let us make bricks burning them well And they had bricks for stone putting them together with sticky earth
Gen  And they said Come let us make a town and a tower whose top will go up as high as heaven and let us make a great name for ourselves so that we may not be wanderers over the face of the earth
Gen  And the Lord came down to see the town and the tower which the children of men were building
Gen  And the Lord said See they are all one people and have all one language and this is only the start of what they may do and now it will not be possible to keep them from any purpose of theirs
Gen  Come let us go down and take away the sense of their language so that they will not be able to make themselves clear to one another
Gen  So the Lord God sent them away into every part of the earth and they gave up building their town
Gen  So it was named Babel because there the Lord took away the sense of all languages and from there the Lord sent them away over all the face of the earth

Gen  And Terah was seventy years old when he became the father of Abram Nahor and Haran
Gen  These are the generations of Terah Terah was the father of Abram Nahor and Haran and Haran was the father of Lot
Gen  And death came to Haran when he was with his father Terah in the land of his birth Ur of the Chaldees
Gen  And Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves the name of Abrams wife was Sarai and the name of Nahors wife was Milcah the daughter of Haran the father of Milcah and Iscah
Gen  And Sarai had no child
Gen  And Terah took Abram his son and Lot the son of Haran and Sarai his daughterinlaw the wife of his son Abram and they went out from Ur of the Chaldees to go to the land of Canaan and they came to Haran and were there for some time
Gen  And all the years of Terahs life were two hundred and five and Terah came to his end in Haran
Gen  Now the Lord said to Abram Go out from your country and from your family and from your fathers house into the land to which I will be your guide
Gen  And I will make of you a great nation blessing you and making your name great and you will be a blessing
Gen  To them who are good to you will I give blessing and on him who does you wrong will I put my curse and you will become a name of blessing to all the families of the earth
Gen  So Abram went as the Lord had said to him and Lot went with him Abram was seventyfive years old when he went away from Haran
Gen  And Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his brothers son and all their goods and the servants which they had got in Haran and they went out to go to the land of Canaan
Gen  And Abram went through the land till he came to Shechem to the holy tree of Moreh At that time the Canaanites were still living in the land
Gen  And the Lord came to Abram and said I will give all this land to your seed then Abram made an altar there to the Lord who had let himself be seen by him
Gen  And moving on from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel he put up his tent having Bethel on the west and Ai on the east and there he made an altar and gave worship to the name of the Lord
Gen  And he went on journeying still to the South
Gen  And because there was little food to be had in that land he went down into Egypt
Gen  Now when he came near to Egypt he said to Sarai his wife Truly you are a fair woman and beautiful to the eye
Gen  And I am certain that when the men of Egypt see you they will say This is his wife and they will put me to death and keep you
Gen  Say then that you are my sister and so it will be well with me because of you and my life will be kept safe on your account
Gen  And so it was that when Abram came into Egypt the men of Egypt looking on the woman saw that she was fair
Gen  And Pharaohs great men having seen her said words in praise of her to Pharaoh and she was taken into Pharaohs house
Gen  And because of her he was good to Abram and he had sheep and oxen and asses and menservants and womenservants and camels
Gen  And the Lord sent great troubles on Pharaohs house because of Sarai Abrams wife
Gen  Then Pharaoh sent for Abram and said What have you done to me why did you not say that she was your wife
Gen  Why did you say that she was your sister so that I took her for my wife now take your wife and go on your way
Gen  And Pharaoh gave orders to his men and they sent him on his way with his wife and all he had
Gen  And Abram went up out of Egypt with his wife and all he had and Lot with him and they came in to the South
Gen  Now Abram had great wealth of cattle and silver and gold
Gen  And travelling on from the South he came to Bethel to the place where his tent had been before between Bethel and Ai
Gen  To the place where he had made his first altar and there Abram gave worship to the name of the Lord
Gen  And Lot who went with him had flocks and herds and tents
Gen  So that the land was not wide enough for the two of them their property was so great that there was not room for them together
Gen  And there was an argument between the keepers of Abrams cattle and the keepers of Lots cattle at that time the Canaanites and Perizzites were still living in the land
Gen  Then Abram said to Lot Let there be no argument between me and you and between my herdmen and your herdmen for we are brothers
Gen  Is not all the land before you then let us go our separate ways if you go to the left I will go to the right or if you take the right I will go to the left
Gen  And Lot lifting up his eyes and looking an the valley of Jordan saw that it was well watered everywhere before the Lord had sent destruction on Sodom and Gomorrah it was like the garden of the Lord like the land of Egypt on the way to Zoar
Gen  So Lot took for himself all the valley of Jordan and went to the east and they were parted from one another
Gen  Abram went on living in the land of Canaan and Lot went to the lowland towns moving his tent as far as Sodom
Gen  Now the men of Sodom were evil and great sinners before the Lord
Gen  And the Lord had said to Abram after Lot was parted from him From this place where you are take a look to the north and to the south to the east and to the west
Gen  For all the land which you see I will give to you and to your seed for ever
Gen  And I will make your children like the dust of the earth so that if the dust of the earth may be numbered then will your children be numbered
Gen  Come go through all the land from one end to the other for I will give it to you
Gen  And Abram moving his tent came and made his livingplace by the holy tree of Mamre which is in Hebron and made an altar there to the Lord
Gen  Now in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar Arioch king of Ellasar Chedorlaomer king of Elam and Tidal king of Goiim
Gen  They made war with Bera king of Sodom and with Birsha king of Gomorrah Shinab king of Admah and Shemeber king of Zeboiim and the king of Bela which is Zoar
Gen  All these came together in the valley of Siddim which is the Salt Sea
Gen  For twelve years they were under the rule of Chedorlaomer but in the thirteenth year they put off his control
Gen  And in the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings who were on his side overcame the Rephaim in Ashterothkarnaim and the Zuzim in Ham and the Emim in Shavehkiriathaim
Gen  And the Horites in their mountain Seir driving them as far as Elparan which is near the waste land
Gen  Then they came back to Enmishpat which is Kadesh making waste all the country of the Amalekites and of the Amorites living in Hazazontamar
Gen  And the king of Sodom with the king of Gomorrah and the king of Admah and the king of Zeboiim and the king of Bela that is Zoar went out and put their forces in position in the valley of Siddim
Gen  Against Chedorlaomer king of Elam and Tidal king of Goiim and Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of Ellasar four kings against the five
Gen  Now the valley of Siddim was full of holes of sticky earth and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah were put to flight and came to their end there but the rest got away to the mountain
Gen  And the four kings took all the goods and food from Sodom and Gomorrah and went on their way
Gen  And in addition they took Lot Abrams brothers son who was living in Sodom and all his goods
Gen  And one who had got away from the fight came and gave word of it to Abram the Hebrew who was living by the holy tree of Mamre the Amorite the brother of Eshcol and Aner who were friends of Abram
Gen  And Abram hearing that his brothers son had been made a prisoner took a band of his trained men three hundred and eighteen of them sons of his house and went after them as far as Dan
Gen  And separating his forces by night he overcame them putting them to flight and going after them as far as Hobah which is on the north side of Damascus
Gen  And he got back all the goods and Lot his brothers son with his goods and the women and the people
Gen  And when he was coming back after putting to flight Chedorlaomer and the other kings he had a meeting with the king of Sodom in the valley of Shaveh that is the Kings Valley
Gen  And Melchizedek king of Salem the priest of the Most High God took bread and wine
Gen  And blessing him said May the blessing of the Most High God maker of heaven and earth be on Abram
Gen  And let the Most High God be praised who has given into your hands those who were against you Then Abram gave him a tenth of all the goods he had taken
Gen  And the king of Sodom said to Abram Give me the prisoners and take the goods for yourself
Gen  But Abram said to the king of Sodom I have taken an oath to the Lord the Most High God maker of heaven and earth
Gen  That I will not take so much as a thread or the cord of a shoe of yours so that you may not say I have given wealth to Abram
Gen  Give me nothing but the food which the fightingmen who went with me have had but let Aner and Eshcol and Mamre have their part of the goods
Gen  After these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision saying Have no fear Abram I will keep you safe and great will be your reward
Gen  And Abram said What will you give me for I have no child and this Eliezer of Damascus will have all my wealth after me
Gen  And Abram said You have given me no child and a servant in my house will get the heritage
Gen  Then said the Lord This man will not get the heritage but a son of your body will have your property after you
Gen  And he took him out into the open air and said to him Let your eyes be lifted to heaven and see if the stars may be numbered even so will your seed be
Gen  And he had faith in the Lord and it was put to his account as righteousness
Gen  And he said to him I am the Lord who took you from Ur of the Chaldees to give you this land for your heritage
Gen  And he said O Lord God how may I be certain that it will be mine
Gen  And he said Take a young cow of three years old and a shegoat of three years old and a sheep of three years old and a dove and a young pigeon
Gen  All these he took cutting them in two and putting one half opposite the other but not cutting the birds in two
Gen  And evil birds came down on the bodies but Abram sent them away
Gen  Now when the sun was going down a deep sleep came on Abram and a dark cloud of fear
Gen  And he said to Abram Truly your seed will be living in a land which is not theirs as servants to a people who will be cruel to them for four hundred years
Gen  But I will be the judge of that nation whose servants they are and they will come out from among them with great wealth
Gen  As for you you will go to your fathers in peace at the end of a long life you will be put in your last restingplace
Gen  And in the fourth generation they will come back here for at present the sin of the Amorite is not full
Gen  Then when the sun went down and it was dark he saw a smoking fire and a flaming light which went between the parts of the bodies
Gen  In that day the Lord made an agreement with Abram and said To your seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt to the great river the river Euphrates
Gen  The Kenite the Kenizzite and the Kadmonite
Gen  And the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Rephaim
Gen  And the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Girgashite and the Jebusite
Gen  Now Sarai Abrams wife had given him no children and she had a servant a woman of Egypt whose name was Hagar
Gen  And Sarai said to Abram See the Lord has not let me have children go in to my servant for I may get a family through her And Abram did as Sarai said
Gen  So after Abram had been living for ten years in the land of Canaan Sarai took Hagar her Egyptian servant and gave her to Abram for his wife
Gen  And he went in to Hagar and she became with child and when she saw that she was with child she no longer had any respect for her masters wife
Gen  And Sarai said to Abram May my wrong be on you I gave you my servant for your wife and when she saw that she was with child she no longer had any respect for me may the Lord be judge between you and me
Gen  And Abram said The woman is in your power do with her whatever seems good to you And Sarai was cruel to her so that she went running away from her
Gen  And an angel of the Lord came to her by a fountain of water in the waste land by the fountain on the way to Shur
Gen  And he said Hagar Sarais servant where have you come from and where are you going And she said I am running away from Sarai my masters wife
Gen  And the angel said to her Go back and put yourself under her authority
Gen  And the angel of the Lord said Your seed will be greatly increased so that it may not be numbered
Gen  And the angel of the Lord said See you are with child and will give birth to a son to whom you will give the name Ishmael because the ears of the Lord were open to your sorrow
Gen  And he will be like a mountain ass among men his hand will be against every man and every mans hand against him and he will keep his place against all his brothers
Gen  And to the Lord who was talking with her she gave this name You are a God who is seen for she said Have I not even here in the waste land had a vision of God and am still living
Gen  So that fountain was named Fountain of Life and Vision it is between Kadesh and Bered
Gen  And Hagar gave birth to a child the son of Abram to whom Abram gave the name of Ishmael
Gen  Abram was eightysix years old when Hagar gave birth to Ishmael
Gen  When Abram was ninetynine years old the Lord came to him and said I am God Ruler of all go in my ways and be upright in all things
Gen  And I will make an agreement between you and me and your offspring will be greatly increased
Gen  And Abram went down on his face on the earth and the Lord God went on talking with him and said
Gen  As for me my agreement is made with you and you will be the father of nations without end
Gen  No longer will your name be Abram but Abraham for I have made you the father of a number of nations
Gen  I will make you very fertile so that nations will come from you and kings will be your offspring
Gen  And I will make between me and you and your seed after you through all generations an eternal agreement to be a God to you and to your seed after you
Gen  And to you and to your seed after you I will give the land in which you are living all the land of Canaan for an eternal heritage and I will be their God
Gen  And God said to Abraham On your side you are to keep the agreement you and your seed after you through all generations
Gen  And this is the agreement which you are to keep with me you and your seed after you every male among you is to undergo circumcision
Gen  In the flesh of your private parts you are to undergo it as a mark of the agreement between me and you
Gen  Every male among you from one generation to another is to undergo circumcision when he is eight days old with every servant whose birth takes place in your house or for whom you gave money to someone of another country and not of your seed
Gen  He who comes to birth in your house and he who is made yours for a price all are to undergo circumcision so that my agreement may be marked in your flesh an agreement for all time
Gen  And any male who does not undergo circumcision will be cut off from his people my agreement has been broken by him
Gen  And God said As for Sarai your wife from now her name will be not Sarai but Sarah
Gen  And I will give her a blessing so that you will have a son by her truly my blessing will be on her and she will be the mother of nations kings of peoples will be her offspring
Gen  Then Abraham went down on his face and laughing said in his heart May a man a hundred years old have a child will Sarah at ninety years old give birth
Gen  And Abraham said to God If only Ishmaels life might be your care
Gen  And God said Not so but Sarah your wife will have a son and you will give him the name Isaac and I will make my agreement with him for ever and with his seed after him
Gen  As for Ishmael I have given ear to your prayer truly I have given him my blessing and I will make him fertile and give him great increase he will be the father of twelve chiefs and I will make him a great nation
Gen  But my agreement will be with Isaac to whom Sarah will give birth a year from this time
Gen  And having said these words God went up from Abraham
Gen  And Abraham took Ishmael his son and all whose birth had taken place in his house and all his servants whom he had made his for a price every male of his house and on that very day he gave them circumcision in the flesh of their private parts as God had said to him
Gen  Abraham was ninetynine years old when he underwent circumcision
Gen  And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he underwent circumcision
Gen  Abraham and Ishmael his son underwent circumcision on that very day
Gen  And all the men of his house those whose birth had taken place in the house and those whom he had got for money from men of other lands underwent circumcision with him
Gen  Now the Lord came to him by the holy tree of Mamre when he was seated in the doorway of his tent in the middle of the day
Gen  And lifting up his eyes he saw three men before him and seeing them he went quickly to them from the door of the tent and went down on his face to the earth
Gen  And said My Lord if now I have grace in your eyes do not go away from your servant
Gen  Let me get water for washing your feet and take your rest under the tree
Gen  And let me get a bit of bread to keep up your strength and after that you may go on your way for this is why you have come to your servant And they said Let it be so
Gen  Then Abraham went quickly into the tent and said to Sarah Get three measures of meal straight away and make cakes
Gen  And running to the herd he took a young ox soft and fat and gave it to the servant and he quickly made it ready
Gen  And he took butter and milk and the young ox which he had made ready and put it before them waiting by them under the tree while they took food
Gen  And they said to him Where is Sarah your wife And he said She is in the tent
Gen  And he said I will certainly come back to you in the spring and Sarah your wife will have a son And his words came to the ears of Sarah who was at the back of the tentdoor
Gen  Now Abraham and Sarah were very old and Sarah was past the time for giving birth
Gen  And Sarah laughing to herself said Now that I am used up am I still to have pleasure my husband himself being old
Gen  And the Lord said Why was Sarah laughing and saying Is it possible for me being old to give birth to a child
Gen  Is there any wonder which the Lord is not able to do At the time I said in the spring I will come back to you and Sarah will have a child
Gen  Then Sarah said I was not laughing for she was full of fear And he said No but you were laughing
Gen  And the men went on from there in the direction of Sodom and Abraham went with them on their way
Gen  And the Lord said Am I to keep back from Abraham the knowledge of what I do
Gen  Seeing that Abraham will certainly become a great and strong nation and his name will be used by all the nations of the earth as a blessing
Gen  For I have made him mine so that he may give orders to his children and those of his line after him to keep the ways of the Lord to do what is good and right so that the Lord may do to Abraham as he has said
Gen  And the Lord said Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is very great and their sin is very evil
Gen  I will go down now and see if their acts are as bad as they seem from the outcry which has come to me and if they are not I will see
Gen  And the men turning from that place went on to Sodom but Abraham was still waiting before the Lord
Gen  And Abraham came near and said Will you let destruction come on the upright with the sinners
Gen  If by chance there are fifty upright men in the town will you give the place to destruction and not have mercy on it because of the fifty upright men
Gen  Let such a thing be far from you to put the upright to death with the sinner will not the judge of all the earth do right
Gen  And the Lord said If there are fifty upright men in the town I will have mercy on it because of them
Gen  And Abraham answering said Truly I who am only dust have undertaken to put my thoughts before the Lord
Gen  If by chance there are five less than fifty upright men will you give up all the town to destruction because of these five And he said I will not give it to destruction if there are fortyfive
Gen  And again he said to him By chance there may be forty there And he said I will not do it if there are forty
Gen  And he said Let not the Lord be angry with me if I say What if there are thirty there And he said I will not do it if there are thirty
Gen  And he said See now I have undertaken to put my thoughts before the Lord what if there are twenty there And he said I will have mercy because of the twenty
Gen  And he said O let not the Lord be angry and I will say only one word more by chance there may be ten there And he said I will have mercy because of the ten
Gen  And the Lord went on his way when his talk with Abraham was ended and Abraham went back to his place
Gen  And at nightfall the two angels came to Sodom and Lot was seated at the way into the town and when he saw them he got up and came before them falling down on his face to the earth
Gen  And he said My masters come now into your servants house and take your rest there for the night and let your feet be washed and early in the morning you may go on your way And they said Not so but we will take our nights rest in the street
Gen  But he made his request more strongly so they went with him into his house and he got food ready for them and made unleavened bread of which they took
Gen  But before they had gone to bed the men of the town all the men of Sodom came round the house young and old from every part of the town
Gen  And crying out to Lot they said Where are the men who came to your house this night Send them out to us so that we may take our pleasure with them
Gen  And Lot went out to them in the doorway shutting the door after him
Gen  And he said My brothers do not this evil
Gen  See now I have two unmarried daughters I will send them out to you so that you may do to them whatever seems good to you only do nothing to these men for this is why they have come under the shade of my roof
Gen  And they said Give way there This one man they said came here from a strange country and will he now be our judge now we will do worse to you than to them and pushing violently against Lot they came near to get the door broken in
Gen  But the men put out their hands and took Lot into the house to them shutting the door again
Gen  But the men who were outside the door they made blind all of them small and great so that they were tired out with looking for the door
Gen  Then the men said to Lot Are there any others of your family here sonsinlaw or sons or daughters take them all out of this place
Gen  For we are about to send destruction on this place because a great outcry against them has come to the ears of the Lord and the Lord has sent us to put an end to the town
Gen  And Lot went out and said to his sonsinlaw who were married to his daughters Come let us go out of this place for the Lord is about to send destruction on the town But his sonsinlaw did not take him seriously
Gen  And when morning came the angels did all in their power to make Lot go saying Get up quickly and take your wife and your two daughters who are here and go for fear that you come to destruction in the punishment of the town
Gen  But while he was waiting the men took him and his wife and his daughters by the hand for the Lord had mercy on them and put them outside the town
Gen  And when they had put them out he said Go for your life without looking back or waiting in the lowland go quickly to the mountain or you will come to destruction
Gen  And Lot said to them Not so O my Lord
Gen  See now your servant has had grace in your eyes and great is your mercy in keeping my life from destruction but I am not able to get as far as the mountain before evil overtakes me and death
Gen  This town now is near and it is a little one O let me go there is it not a little one so that my life may be safe
Gen  And he said See I have given you your request in this one thing more I will not send destruction on this town
Gen  Go there quickly for I am not able to do anything till you have come there For this reason the town was named Zoar
Gen  The sun was up when Lot came to Zoar
Gen  Then the Lord sent fire and flaming smoke raining down from heaven on Sodom and Gomorrah
Gen  And he sent destruction on those towns with all the lowland and all the people of those towns and every green thing in the land
Gen  But Lots wife looking back became a pillar of salt
Gen  And Abraham got up early in the morning and went to the place where he had been talking with the Lord
Gen  And looking in the direction of Sodom and Gomorrah and the lowland he saw the smoke of the land going up like the smoke of an oven
Gen  So it came about that when God sent destruction on the towns of the lowland he kept his word to Abraham and sent Lot safely away when he put an end to the towns where he was living
Gen  Then Lot went up out of Zoar to the mountain and was living there with his two daughters for fear kept him from living in Zoar and he and his daughters made their livingplace in a hole in the rock
Gen  And the older daughter said to her sister Our father is old and there is no man to be a husband to us in the natural way
Gen  Come let us give our father much wine and we will go into his bed so that we may have offspring by our father
Gen  And that night they made their father take much wine and the older daughter went into his bed and he had no knowledge of when she went in or when she went away
Gen  And on the day after the older daughter said to the younger Last night I was with my father let us make him take much wine this night again and do you go to him so that we may have offspring by our father
Gen  And that night again they made their father take much wine and the younger daughter went into his bed and he had no knowledge of when she went in or when she went away
Gen  And so the two daughters of Lot were with child by their father
Gen  And the older daughter had a son and she gave him the name Moab he is the father of the Moabites to this day
Gen  And the younger had a son and gave him the name Benammi from him come the children of Ammon to this day
Gen  And Abraham went on his way from there to the land of the South and was living between Kadesh and Shur in Gerar
Gen  And Abraham said of Sarah his wife She is my sister and Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah
Gen  But God came to Abimelech in a dream in the night and said to him Truly you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken for she is a mans wife
Gen  Now Abimelech had not come near her and he said Lord will you put to death an upright nation
Gen  Did he not say to me himself She is my sister and she herself said He is my brother with an upright heart and clean hands have I done this
Gen  And God said to him in the dream I see that you have done this with an upright heart and I have kept you from sinning against me for this reason I did not let you come near her
Gen  So now give the man back his wife for he is a prophet and let him say a prayer for you so your life may be safe but if you do not give her back be certain that death will come to you and all your house
Gen  So Abimelech got up early in the morning and sent for all his servants and gave them word of these things and they were full of fear
Gen  Then Abimelech sent for Abraham and said What have you done to us what wrong have I done you that you have put on me and on my kingdom so great a sin You have done to me things which are not to be done
Gen  And Abimelech said to Abraham Why did you do this thing
Gen  And Abraham said Because it seemed to me that there was no fear of God in this place and that they might put me to death because of my wife
Gen  And in fact she is my sister the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother and she became my wife
Gen  And when God sent me wandering from my fathers house I said to her Let this be the sign of your love for me wherever we go say of me He is my brother
Gen  Then Abimelech gave to Abraham sheep and oxen and menservants and womenservants and gave him back his wife Sarah
Gen  And Abimelech said See all my land is before you take whatever place seems good to you
Gen  And he said to Sarah See I have given to your brother a thousand bits of silver so that your wrong may be put right now your honour is clear in the eyes of all
Gen  Then Abraham made prayer to God and God made Abimelech well again and his wife and his womenservants so that they had children
Gen  For the Lord had kept all the women of the house of Abimelech from having children because of Sarah Abrahams wife
Gen  And the Lord came to Sarah as he had said and did to her as he had undertaken
Gen  And Sarah became with child and gave Abraham a son when he was old at the time named by God
Gen  And Abraham gave to his son to whom Sarah had given birth the name Isaac
Gen  And when his son Isaac was eight days old Abraham made him undergo circumcision as God had said to him
Gen  Now Abraham was a hundred years old when the birth of Isaac took place
Gen  And Sarah said God has given me cause for laughing and everyone who has news of it will be laughing with me
Gen  And she said Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would have a child at her breast for see I have given him a son now when he is old
Gen  And when the child was old enough to be taken from the breast Abraham made a great feast
Gen  And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian playing with Isaac
Gen  So she said to Abraham Send away that woman and her son for the son of that woman is not to have a part in the heritage with my son Isaac
Gen  And this was a great grief to Abraham because of his son
Gen  But God said Let it not be a grief to you because of the boy and Hagar his mother give ear to whatever Sarah says to you because it is from Isaac that your seed will take its name
Gen  And I will make a nation of the son of your servantwoman because he is your seed
Gen  And early in the morning Abraham got up and gave Hagar some bread and a waterskin and put the boy on her back and sent her away and she went wandering in the waste land of Beersheba
Gen  And when all the water in the skin was used up she put the child down under a tree
Gen  And she went some distance away about an arrow flight and seating herself on the earth she gave way to bitter weeping saying Let me not see the death of my child
Gen  And the boys cry came to the ears of God and the angel of God said to Hagar from heaven Hagar why are you weeping have no fear for the childs cry has come to the ears of God
Gen  Come take your child in your arms for I will make of him a great nation
Gen  Then God made her eyes open and she saw a waterspring and she got water in the skin and gave the boy a drink
Gen  And God was with the boy and he became tall and strong and he became a bowman living in the waste land
Gen  And while he was in the waste land of Paran his mother got him a wife from the land of Egypt
Gen  Now at that time Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his army said to Abraham I see that God is with you in all you do
Gen  Now then give me your oath in the name of God that you will not be false to me or to my sons after me but that as I have been good to you so you will be to me and to this land where you have been living
Gen  And Abraham said I will give you my oath
Gen  But Abraham made a protest to Abimelech because of a waterhole which Abimelechs servants had taken by force
Gen  But Abimelech said I have no idea who has done this thing you never gave me word of it and I had no knowledge of it till this day
Gen  And Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech and the two of them made an agreement together
Gen  And Abraham put seven young lambs of the flock on one side by themselves
Gen  Then Abimelech said What are these seven lambs which you have put on one side
Gen  And he said Take these seven lambs from me as a witness that I have made this waterhole
Gen  So he gave that place the name Beersheba because there the two of them had given their oaths
Gen  So they made an agreement at Beersheba and Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his army went back to the land of the Philistines
Gen  And Abraham after planting a holy tree in Beersheba gave worship to the name of the Lord the Eternal God
Gen  And Abraham went on living in the land of the Philistines as in a strange country
Gen  Now after these things God put Abraham to the test and said to him Abraham and he said Here am I
Gen  And he said to him Take your son your dearly loved only son Isaac and go to the land of Moriah and give him as a burned offering on one of the mountains of which I will give you knowledge
Gen  And Abraham got up early in the morning and made ready his ass and took with him two of his young men and Isaac his son and after the wood for the burned offering had been cut he went on his way to the place of which God had given him word
Gen  And on the third day Abraham lifting up his eyes saw the place a long way off
Gen  Then he said to his young men Keep here with the ass and I and the boy will go on and give worship and come back again to you
Gen  And Abraham put the wood for the burned offering on his sons back and he himself took the fire and the knife in his hand and the two of them went on together
Gen  Then Isaac said to Abraham My father and he said Here am I my son And he said We have wood and fire here but where is the lamb for the burned offering
Gen  And Abraham said God himself will give the lamb for the burned offering so they went on together
Gen  And they came to the place of which God had given him knowledge and there Abraham made the altar and put the wood in place on it and having made tight the bands round Isaac his son he put him on the wood on the altar
Gen  And stretching out his hand Abraham took the knife to put his son to death
Gen  But the voice of the angel of the Lord came from heaven saying Abraham Abraham and he said Here am I
Gen  And he said Let not your hand be stretched out against the boy to do anything to him for now I am certain that the fear of God is in your heart because you have not kept back your son your only son from me
Gen  And lifting up his eyes Abraham saw a sheep fixed by its horns in the brushwood and Abraham took the sheep and made a burned offering of it in place of his son
Gen  And Abraham gave that place the name Yahwehyireh as it is said to this day In the mountain the Lord is seen
Gen  And the voice of the angel of the Lord came to Abraham a second time from heaven
Gen  Saying I have taken an oath by my name says the Lord because you have done this and have not kept back from me your dearly loved only son
Gen  That I will certainly give you my blessing and your seed will be increased like the stars of heaven and the sand by the seaside your seed will take the land of those who are against them
Gen  And your seed will be a blessing to all the nations of the earth because you have done what I gave you orders to do
Gen  Then Abraham went back to his young men and they went together to Beersheba the place where Abraham was living
Gen  After these things Abraham had news that Milcah the wife of his brother Nahor had given birth to children
Gen  Uz the oldest and Buz his brother and Kemuel the father of Aram
Gen  And Chesed and Hazo and Pildash and Jidlaph and Bethuel
Gen  Bethuel was the father of Rebekah these eight were the children of Milcah and Nahor Abrahams brother
Gen  And his servant Reumah gave birth to Tebah and Gaham and Tahash and Maacah
Gen  Now the years of Sarahs life were a hundred and twentyseven
Gen  And Sarahs death took place in Kiriatharba that is Hebron in the land of Canaan and Abraham went into his house weeping and sorrowing for Sarah
Gen  And Abraham came from his dead and said to the children of Heth
Gen  I am living among you as one from a strange country give me some land here as my property so that I may put my dead to rest
Gen  And in answer the children of Heth said to Abraham
Gen  My lord truly you are a great chief among us take the best of our restingplaces for your dead not one of us will keep back from you a place where you may put your dead to rest
Gen  And Abraham got up and gave honour to the children of Heth the people of that land
Gen  And he said to them If you will let me put my dead to rest here make a request for me to Ephron the son of Zohar
Gen  That he will give me the hollow in the rock named Machpelah which is his property at the end of his field let him give it to me for its full price as a restingplace for my dead among you
Gen  Now Ephron was seated among the children of Heth and Ephron the Hittite gave Abraham his answer in the hearing of the children of Heth and of all those who came into his town saying
Gen  No my lord I will give you the field with the hollow in the rock before all the children of my people will I give it to you for a restingplace for your dead
Gen  And Abraham went down on his face before the people of the land
Gen  And Abraham said to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land If only you will give ear to me I will give you the price of the field take it and let me put my dead to rest there
Gen  So Ephron said to Abraham
Gen  My lord give ear to me the value of the land is four hundred shekels what is that between me and you so put your dead to rest there
Gen  And Abraham took note of the price fixed by Ephron in the hearing of the children of Heth and gave him four hundred shekels in current money
Gen  So Ephrons field at Machpelah near Mamre with the hollow in the rock and all the trees in the field and round it
Gen  Became the property of Abraham before the eyes of the children of Heth and of all who came into the town
Gen  Then Abraham put Sarah his wife to rest in the hollow rock in the field of Machpelah near Mamre that is Hebron in the land of Canaan
Gen  And the field and the hollow rock were handed over to Abraham as his property by the children of Heth
Gen  Now Abraham was old and far on in years and the Lord had given him everything in full measure
Gen  And Abraham said to his chief servant the manager of all his property Come now put your hand under my leg
Gen  And take an oath by the Lord the God of heaven and the God of the earth that you will not get a wife for my son Isaac from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I am living
Gen  But that you will go into my country and to my relations and get a wife there for my son Isaac
Gen  And the servant said If by chance the woman will not come with me into this land am I to take your son back again to the land from which you came
Gen  And Abraham said Take care that you do not let my son go back to that land
Gen  The Lord God of heaven who took me from my fathers house and from the land of my birth and made an oath to me saying To your seed I will give this land he will send his angel before you and give you a wife for my son in that land
Gen  And if the woman will not come with you then you are free from this oath only do not take my son back there
Gen  And the servant put his hand under Abrahams leg and gave him his oath about this thing
Gen  And the servant took ten of his masters camels and all sorts of good things of his masters and went to Mesopotamia to the town of Nahor
Gen  And he made the camels take their rest outside the town by the waterspring in the evening at the time when the women came to get water
Gen  And he said O Lord the God of my master Abraham let me do well in what I have undertaken this day and give your mercy to my master Abraham
Gen  See I am waiting here by the waterspring and the daughters of the town are coming out to get water
Gen  Now may the girl to whom I say Let down your vessel and give me a drink and who says in answer Here is a drink for you and let me give water to your camels may she be the one marked out by you for your servant Isaac so may I be certain that you have been good to my master Abraham
Gen  And even before his words were ended Rebekah the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah who was the wife of Nahor Abrahams brother came out with her watervessel on her arm
Gen  She was a very beautiful girl a virgin who had never been touched by a man and she went down to the spring to get water in her vessel
Gen  And the servant came running to her and said Give me a little water from your vessel
Gen  And she said Take a drink my lord and quickly letting down her vessel onto her hand she gave him a drink
Gen  And having done so she said I will get water for your camels till they have had enough
Gen  And after putting the water from her vessel into the animals drinkingplace she went quickly back to the spring and got water for all the camels
Gen  And the man looking at her said nothing waiting to see if the Lord had given his journey a good outcome
Gen  And when the camels had had enough the man took a gold nosering half a shekel in weight and two ornaments for her arms of ten shekels weight of gold
Gen  And said to her Whose daughter are you is there room in your fathers house for us
Gen  And she said to him I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah Nahors wife
Gen  And she said We have a great store of dry grass and cattlefood and there is room for you
Gen  And with bent head the man gave worship to the Lord
Gen  And said Praise be to the Lord the God of my master Abraham who has given a sign that he is good and true to my master by guiding me straight to the house of my masters family
Gen  So the girl went running and took the news of these things to her mothers house
Gen  Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban and he came out quickly to the man at the waterspring
Gen  And when he saw the nosering and the ornaments on his sisters hands and when she gave him word of what the man had said to her then he went out to the man who was waiting with the camels by the waterspring
Gen  And he said to him Come in you on whom is the blessing of the Lord why are you waiting outside for I have made the house ready for you and a place for the camels
Gen  Then the man came into the house and Laban took their cords off the camels and gave them dry grass and food and he gave to him and the men who were with him water for washing their feet
Gen  And meat was put before him but he said I will not take food till I have made my business clear to you And they said Do so
Gen  And he said I am Abrahams servant
Gen  The Lord has given my master every blessing and he has become great he has given him flocks and herds and silver and gold and menservants and womenservants and camels and asses
Gen  And when Sarah my masters wife was old she gave birth to a son to whom he has given all he has
Gen  And my master made me take an oath saying Do not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I am living
Gen  But go to my fathers house and to my relations for a wife for my son
Gen  And I said to my master What if the woman will not come with me
Gen  And he said The Lord whom I have ever kept before me will send his angel with you who will make it possible for you to get a wife for my son from my relations and my fathers house
Gen  And you will be free from your oath to me when you come to my people and if they will not give her to you you will be free from your oath
Gen  And I came today to the waterspring and I said O Lord the God of my master Abraham if it is your purpose to give a good outcome to my journey
Gen  Let it come about that while I am waiting here by the waterspring if a girl comes to get water and I say to her Give me a little water from your vessel and she says
Gen  Take a drink and I will get water for your camels let her be the woman marked out by the Lord for my masters son
Gen  And even while I was saying this to myself Rebekah came out with her vessel on her arm and she went down to the spring to get water and I said to her Give me a drink
Gen  And straight away she took down her vessel from her arm and said Take a drink and I will get water for your camels
Gen  And questioning her I said Whose daughter are you And she said The daughter of Bethuel the son of Nahor and Milcah his wife Then I put the ring on her nose and the ornaments on her hands
Gen  And with bent head I gave worship and praise to the Lord the God of my master Abraham by whom I had been guided in the right way to get the daughter of my masters brother for his son
Gen  And now say if you will do what is good and right for my master or not in order that it may be clear to me what I have to do
Gen  Then Laban and Bethuel said in answer This is the Lords doing it is not for us to say Yes or No to you
Gen  See here is Rebekah take her and go and let her be your masters sons wife as the Lord has said
Gen  And at these words Abrahams servant went down on his face and gave praise to the Lord
Gen  Then he took jewels of silver and jewels of gold and fair robes and gave them to Rebekah and he gave things of value to her mother and her brother
Gen  Then he and the men who were with him had food and drink and took their rest there that night and in the morning he got up and said Let me now go back to my master
Gen  But her brother and her mother said Let the girl be with us a week or ten days and then she may go
Gen  And he said Do not keep me the Lord has given a good outcome to my journey let me now go back to my master
Gen  And they said We will send for the girl and let her make the decision
Gen  And they sent for Rebekah and said to her Are you ready to go with this man And she said I am ready
Gen  So they sent their sister Rebekah and her servant with Abrahams servant and his men
Gen  And they gave Rebekah their blessing saying O sister may you be the mother of thousands and ten thousands and may your seed overcome all those who make war against them
Gen  So Rebekah and her servantwomen went with the man seated on the camels and so the servant took Rebekah and went on his way
Gen  Now Isaac had come through the waste land to Beerlahairoi for he was living in the South
Gen  And when the evening was near he went wandering out into the fields and lifting up his eyes he saw camels coming
Gen  And when Rebekah looking up saw Isaac she got down from her camel
Gen  And said to the servant Who is that man coming to us through the field And the servant said It is my master then she took her veil covering her face with it
Gen  Then the servant gave Isaac the story of all he had done
Gen  And Isaac took Rebekah into his tent and she became his wife and in his love for her Isaac was comforted after his fathers death
Gen  And Abraham took another wife named Keturah
Gen  She became the mother of Zimran and Jokshan and Medan and Midian and Ishbak and Shuah
Gen  And Jokshan became the father of Sheba and Dedan And from Dedan came the Asshurim and Letushim and Leummim
Gen  And from Midian came Ephah and Epher and Hanoch and Abida and Eldaah All these were the offspring of Keturah
Gen  Now Abraham gave all his property to Isaac
Gen  But to the sons of his other women he gave offerings and sent them away while he was still living into the east country
Gen  Now the years of Abrahams life were a hundred and seventyfive
Gen  And Abraham came to his death an old man full of years and he was put to rest with his people
Gen  And Isaac and Ishmael his sons put him to rest in the hollow rock of Machpelah in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite near Mamre
Gen  The same field which Abraham got from the children of Heth there Abraham was put to rest with Sarah his wife
Gen  Now after the death of Abraham the blessing of God was with Isaac his son
Gen  Now these are the generations of Ishmael the son of Abraham whose mother was Hagar the Egyptian the servant of Sarah
Gen  These are the names of the sons of Ishmael by their generations Ishmaels first son was Nebaioth then Kedar and Adbeel and Mibsam
Gen  And Mishma and Dumah and Massa
Gen  Hadad and Tema Jetur Naphish and Kedemah
Gen  These are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names in their towns and their tentcircles twelve chiefs with their peoples
Gen  And the years of Ishmaels life were a hundred and thirtyseven and he came to his end and was put to rest with his people
Gen  And their country was from Havilah to Shur which is east of Egypt they took their place to the east of all their brothers
Gen  Now these are the generations of Abrahams son Isaac
Gen  Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah the daughter of Bethuel the Aramaean of Paddanaram and the sister of Laban the Aramaean to be his wife
Gen  Isaac made prayer to the Lord for his wife because she had no children and the Lord gave ear to his prayer and Rebekah became with child
Gen  And the children were fighting together inside her and she said If it is to be so why am I like this So she went to put her question to the Lord
Gen  And the Lord said to her Two nations are in your body and two peoples will come to birth from you the one will be stronger than the other and the older will be the servant of the younger
Gen  And when the time came for her to give birth there were two children in her body
Gen  And the first came out red from head to foot like a robe of hair and they gave him the name of Esau
Gen  And after him his brother came out gripping Esaus foot and he was named Jacob Isaac was sixty years old when she gave birth to them
Gen  And the boys came to full growth and Esau became a man of the open country an expert bowman but Jacob was a quiet man living in tents
Gen  Now Isaacs love was for Esau because Esaus meat was greatly to his taste but Rebekah had more love for Jacob
Gen  And one day Jacob was cooking some soup when Esau came in from the fields in great need of food
Gen  And Esau said to Jacob Give me a full meal of that red soup for I am overcome with need for food for this reason he was named Edom
Gen  And Jacob said First of all give me your birthright
Gen  And Esau said Truly I am at the point of death what profit is the birthright to me
Gen  And Jacob said First of all give me your oath and he gave him his oath handing over his birthright to Jacob
Gen  Then Jacob gave him bread and soup and he took food and drink and went away caring little for his birthright
Gen  Then came a time of great need in the land like that which had been before in the days of Abraham And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines at Gerar
Gen  And the Lord came to him in a vision and said Do not go down to Egypt keep in the land of which I will give you knowledge
Gen  Keep in this land and I will be with you and give you my blessing for to you and to your seed will I give all these lands giving effect to the oath which I made to your father Abraham
Gen  I will make your seed like the stars of heaven in number and will give them all these lands and your seed will be a blessing to all the nations of the earth
Gen  Because Abraham gave ear to my voice and kept my words my rules my orders and my laws
Gen  So Isaac went on living in Gerar
Gen  And when he was questioned by the men of the place about his wife he said She is my sister fearing to say She is my wife for he said the men of the place may put me to death on account of Rebekah because she is very beautiful
Gen  And when he had been there for some time Abimelech king of the Philistines looking through a window saw Isaac playing with Rebekah his wife
Gen  And he said to Isaac It is clear that she is your wife why then did you say She is my sister And Isaac said For fear that I might be put to death because of her
Gen  Then Abimelech said What have you done to us one of the people might well have had connection with your wife and the sin would have been ours
Gen  And Abimelech gave orders to his people that anyone touching Isaac or his wife was to be put to death
Gen  Now Isaac planting seed in that land got in the same year fruit a hundred times as much for the blessing of the Lord was on him
Gen  And his wealth became very great increasing more and more
Gen  For he had great wealth of flocks and herds and great numbers of servants so that the Philistines were full of envy
Gen  Now all the waterholes which his fathers servants had made in the days of Abraham had been stopped up with earth by the Philistines
Gen  And Abimelech said to Isaac Go away from us for you are stronger than we are
Gen  So Isaac went away from there and put up his tents in the valley of Gerar making his livingplace there
Gen  And he made again the waterholes which had been made in the days of Abraham his father and which had been stopped up by the Philistines and he gave them the names which his father had given them
Gen  Now Isaacs servants made holes in the valley and came to a spring of flowing water
Gen  But the herdmen of Gerar had a fight with Isaacs herdmen for they said The spring is ours so he gave the spring the name of Esek because there was a fight about it
Gen  Then they made another waterhole and there was a fight about that so he gave it the name of Sitnah
Gen  Then he went away from there and made another waterhole about which there was no fighting so he gave it the name of Rehoboth for he said Now the Lord has made room for us and we will have fruit in this land
Gen  And from there he went on to Beersheba
Gen  That night the Lord came to him in a vision and said I am the God of your father Abraham have no fear for I am with you blessing you and your seed will be increased because of my servant Abraham
Gen  Then he made an altar there and gave worship to the name of the Lord and he put up his tents there and there his servants made a waterhole
Gen  And Abimelech had come to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his friend and Phicol the captain of his army
Gen  And Isaac said to them Why have you come to me seeing that in your hate for me you sent me away from you
Gen  And they said We saw clearly that the Lord was with you so we said Let there be an oath between us and you and let us make an agreement with you
Gen  That you will do us no damage even as we put no hand on you and did you nothing but good and sent you away in peace and now the blessing of the Lord is on you
Gen  Then he made a feast for them and they all had food and drink
Gen  And early in the morning they took an oath one to the other then Isaac sent them away and they went on their way in peace
Gen  And that day Isaacs servants came to him and gave him word of the waterhole which they had made and said to him We have come to water
Gen  And he gave it the name of Shibah so the name of that town is Beersheba to this day
Gen  And when Esau was forty years old he took as his wives Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite
Gen  And Isaac and Rebekah had grief of mind because of them
Gen  Now when Isaac was old and his eyes had become clouded so that he was not able to see he sent for Esau his first son and said to him My son and he said Here am I
Gen  And he said See now I am old and my death may take place at any time
Gen  So take your arrows and your bow and go out to the field and get meat for me
Gen  And make me food good to the taste such as is pleasing to me and put it before me so that I may have a meal and give you my blessing before death comes to me
Gen  Now Isaacs words to his son were said in Rebekahs hearing Then Esau went out to get the meat
Gen  And Rebekah said to Jacob her son Your father said to your brother Esau in my hearing
Gen  Go and get some roes meat and make me a good meal so that I may be full and give you my blessing before the Lord before my death
Gen  Now my son do what I say
Gen  Go to the flock and get me two fat young goats and I will make of them a meal to your fathers taste
Gen  And you will take it to him so that he may have a good meal and give you his blessing before his death
Gen  And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother But Esau my brother is covered with hair while I am smooth
Gen  If by chance my father puts his hand on me it will seem to him that I am tricking him and he will put a curse on me in place of a blessing
Gen  And his mother said Let the curse be on me my son only do as I say and go and get them for me
Gen  So he went and got them and took them to his mother and she made a meal to his fathers taste
Gen  And Rebekah took the fair robes of her oldest son which were with her in the house and put them on Jacob her younger son
Gen  And she put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck
Gen  And she gave into the hand of Jacob her son the meat and the bread which she had made ready
Gen  And he came to his father and said My father and he said Here am I who are you my son
Gen  And Jacob said I am Esau your oldest son I have done as you said come now be seated and take of my meat so that you may give me a blessing
Gen  And Isaac said How is it that you have got it so quickly my son And he said Because the Lord your God made it come my way
Gen  And Isaac said Come near so that I may put my hand on you my son and see if you are truly my son Esau or not
Gen  And Jacob went near his father Isaac and he put his hands on him and he said The voice is Jacobs voice but the hands are the hands of Esau
Gen  And he did not make out who he was because his hands were covered with hair like his brother Esaus hands so he gave him a blessing
Gen  And he said Are you truly my son Esau And he said I am
Gen  And he said Put it before me and I will take of my sons meat so that I may give you a blessing And he put it before him and he took it and he gave him wine and he had a drink
Gen  And his father Isaac said to him Come near now my son and give me a kiss
Gen  And he came near and gave him a kiss and smelling the smell of his clothing he gave him a blessing and said See the smell of my son is like the smell of a field on which the blessing of the Lord has come
Gen  May God give you the dew of heaven and the good things of the earth and grain and wine in full measure
Gen  Let peoples be your servants and nations go down before you be lord over your brothers and let your mothers sons go down before you a curse be on everyone by whom you are cursed and a blessing on those who give you a blessing
Gen  And when Isaac had come to the end of blessing Jacob and Jacob had not long gone away from Isaac his father Esau came in from the field
Gen  And he made ready a meal good to the taste and took it to his father and said to him Let my father get up and take of his sons meat so that you may give me a blessing
Gen  And Isaac his father said to him Who are you And he said I am your oldest son Esau
Gen  And in great fear Isaac said Who then is he who got meat and put it before me and I took it all before you came and gave him a blessing and his it will be
Gen  And hearing the words of his father Esau gave a great and bitter cry and said to his father Give a blessing to me even to me O my father
Gen  And he said Your brother came with deceit and took away your blessing
Gen  And he said Is it because he is named Jacob that he has twice taken my place for he took away my birthright and now he has taken away my blessing And he said Have you not kept a blessing for me
Gen  And Isaac answering said But I have made him your master and have given him all his brothers for servants I have made him strong with grain and wine what then am I to do for you my son
Gen  And Esau said to his father Is that the only blessing you have my father give a blessing to me even me And Esau was overcome with weeping
Gen  Then Isaac his father made answer and said to him Far from the fertile places of the earth and far from the dew of heaven on high will your livingplace be
Gen  By your sword will you get your living and you will be your brothers servant but when your power is increased his yoke will be broken from off your neck
Gen  So Esau was full of hate for Jacob because of his fathers blessing and he said in his heart The days of weeping for my father are near then I will put my brother Jacob to death
Gen  Then Rebekah hearing what Esau had said sent for Jacob her younger son and said to him It seems that your brother Esau is purposing to put you to death
Gen  So now my son do what I say go quickly to Haran to my brother Laban
Gen  And be there with him for a little time till your brothers wrath is turned away
Gen  Till the memory of what you have done to him is past and he is no longer angry then I will send word for you to come back are the two of you to be taken from me in one day
Gen  Then Rebekah said to Isaac My life is a weariness to me because of the daughters of Heth if Jacob takes a wife from among the daughters of Heth such as these the women of this land of what use will my life be to me
Gen  Then Isaac sent for Jacob and blessing him said Do not take a wife from among the women of Canaan
Gen  But go to Paddanaram to the house of Bethuel your mothers father and there get yourself a wife from the daughters of Laban your mothers brother
Gen  And may God the Ruler of all give you his blessing giving you fruit and increase so that you may become an army of peoples
Gen  And may God give you the blessing of Abraham to you and to your seed so that the land of your wanderings which God gave to Abraham may be your heritage
Gen  So Isaac sent Jacob away and he went to Paddanaram to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramaean the brother of Rebekah the mother of Jacob and Esau
Gen  So when Esau saw that Isaac had given Jacob his blessing and sent him away to Paddanaram to get a wife for himself there blessing him and saying to him Do not take a wife from among the women of Canaan
Gen  And that Jacob had done as his father and mother said and had gone to Paddanaram
Gen  It was clear to Esau that his father had no love for the women of Canaan
Gen  So Esau went to Ishmael and took Mahalath the daughter of Abrahams son Ishmael the sister of Nebaioth to be his wife in addition to the wives he had
Gen  So Jacob went out from Beersheba to go to Haran
Gen  And coming to a certain place he made it his restingplace for the night for the sun had gone down and he took one of the stones which were there and putting it under his head he went to sleep in that place
Gen  And he had a dream and in his dream he saw steps stretching from earth to heaven and the angels of God were going up and down on them
Gen  And he saw the Lord by his side saying I am the Lord the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac I will give to you and to your seed this land on which you are sleeping
Gen  Your seed will be like the dust of the earth covering all the land to the west and to the east to the north and to the south you and your seed will be a name of blessing to all the families of the earth
Gen  And truly I will be with you and will keep you wherever you go guiding you back again to this land and I will not give you up till I have done what I have said to you
Gen  And Jacob awaking from his sleep said Truly the Lord is in this place and I was not conscious of it
Gen  And fear came on him and he said This is a holy place this is nothing less than the house of God and the doorway of heaven
Gen  And early in the morning Jacob took the stone which had been under his head and put it up as a pillar and put oil on it
Gen  And he gave that place the name of Bethel but before that time the town was named Luz
Gen  Then Jacob took an oath and said If God will be with me and keep me safe on my journey and give me food and clothing to put on
Gen  So that I come again to my fathers house in peace then I will take the Lord to be my God
Gen  And this stone which I have put up for a pillar will be Gods house and of all you give me I will give a tenth part to you
Gen  Then Jacob went on his journey till he came to the land of the children of the East
Gen  And there he saw a waterhole in a field and by the side of it three flocks of sheep for there they got water for the sheep and on the mouth of the waterhole there was a great stone
Gen  And all the flocks would come together there and when the stone had been rolled away they would give the sheep water and put the stone back again in its place on the mouth of the waterhole
Gen  Then Jacob said to the herdmen My brothers where do you come from And they said From Haran
Gen  And he said to them Have you any knowledge of Laban the son of Nahor And they said We have
Gen  And he said to them Is he well And they said He is well and here is Rachel his daughter coming with the sheep
Gen  Then Jacob said The sun is still high and it is not time to get the cattle together get water for the sheep and go and give them their food
Gen  And they said We are not able to do so till all the flocks have come together and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the waterhole then we will get water for the sheep
Gen  While he was still talking with them Rachel came with her fathers sheep for she took care of them
Gen  Then when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mothers brother coming with Labans sheep he came near and rolling the stone away from the mouth of the hole he got water for Labans flock
Gen  And weeping for joy Jacob gave Rachel a kiss
Gen  And Rachel hearing from Jacob that he was her fathers relation and that he was the son of Rebekah went running to give her father news of it
Gen  And Laban hearing news of Jacob his sisters son came running and took Jacob in his arms and kissing him made him come into his house And Jacob gave him news of everything
Gen  And Laban said to him Truly you are my bone and my flesh And he kept Jacob with him for the space of a month
Gen  Then Laban said to Jacob Because you are my brother are you to be my servant for nothing say now what is your payment to be
Gen  Now Laban had two daughters the name of the older was Leah and the name of the younger was Rachel
Gen  And Leahs eyes were clouded but Rachel was fair in face and form
Gen  And Jacob was in love with Rachel and he said I will be your servant seven years for Rachel your younger daughter
Gen  And Laban said It is better for you to have her than another man go on living here with me
Gen  And Jacob did seven years work for Rachel and because of his love for her it seemed to him only a very little time
Gen  Then Jacob said to Laban Give me my wife so that I may have her for the days are ended
Gen  And Laban got together all the men of the place and gave a feast
Gen  And in the evening he took Leah his daughter and gave her to him and he went in to her
Gen  And Laban gave Zilpah his servantgirl to Leah to be her waitingwoman
Gen  And in the morning Jacob saw that it was Leah and he said to Laban What have you done to me was I not working for you so that I might have Rachel why have you been false to me
Gen  And Laban said In our country we do not let the younger daughter be married before the older
Gen  Let the week of the bridefeast come to its end and then we will give you the other in addition if you will be my servant for another seven years
Gen  And Jacob did so and when the week was ended Laban gave him his daughter Rachel for his wife
Gen  And Laban gave Rachel his servantgirl Bilhah to be her waitingwoman
Gen  Then Jacob took Rachel as his wife and his love for her was greater than his love for Leah and he went on working for Laban for another seven years
Gen  Now the Lord seeing that Leah was not loved gave her a child while Rachel had no children
Gen  And Leah was with child and gave birth to a son to whom she gave the name Reuben for she said The Lord has seen my sorrow now my husband will have love for me
Gen  Then she became with child again and gave birth to a son and said Because it has come to the Lords ears that I am not loved he has given me this son in addition and she gave him the name Simeon
Gen  And she was with child again and gave birth to a son and said Now at last my husband will be united to me because I have given him three sons so he was named Levi
Gen  And she was with child again and gave birth to a son and she said This time I will give praise to the Lord so he was named Judah after this she had no more children for a time
Gen  Now Rachel because she had no children was full of envy of her sister and she said to Jacob If you do not give me children I will not go on living
Gen  But Jacob was angry with Rachel and said Am I in the place of God who has kept your body from having fruit
Gen  Then she said Here is my servant Bilhah go in to her so that she may have a child on my knees and I may have a family by her
Gen  So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife and Jacob went in to her
Gen  And Bilhah became with child and gave birth to a son
Gen  Then Rachel said God has been my judge and has given ear to my voice and has given me a son so he was named Dan
Gen  And again Bilhah Rachels servant was with child and gave birth to a second son
Gen  And Rachel said I have had a great fight with my sister and I have overcome her and she gave the child the name Naphtali
Gen  When it was clear to Leah that she would have no more children for a time she gave Zilpah her servant to Jacob as a wife
Gen  And Zilpah Leahs servant gave birth to a son
Gen  And Leah said It has gone well for me and she gave him the name Gad
Gen  And Zilpah Leahs servant gave birth to a second son
Gen  And Leah said Happy am I and all women will give witness to my joy and she gave him the name Asher
Gen  Now at the time of the graincutting Reuben saw some lovefruits in the field and took them to his mother Leah And Rachel said to her Let me have some of your sons lovefruits
Gen  But Leah said to her Is it a small thing that you have taken my husband from me and now would you take my sons lovefruits Then Rachel said You may have him tonight in exchange for your sons lovefruits
Gen  In the evening when Jacob came in from the field Leah went out to him and said Tonight you are to come to me for I have given my sons lovefruits as a price for you And he went in to her that night
Gen  And God gave ear to her and she became with child and gave Jacob a fifth son
Gen  Then Leah said God has made payment to me for giving my servantgirl to my husband so she gave her son the name Issachar
Gen  And again Leah became with child and she gave Jacob a sixth son
Gen  And she said God has given me a good brideprice now at last will I have my husband living with me for I have given him six sons and she gave him the name Zebulun
Gen  After that she had a daughter to whom she gave the name Dinah
Gen  Then God gave thought to Rachel and hearing her prayer he made her fertile
Gen  And she was with child and gave birth to a son and she said God has taken away my shame
Gen  And she gave him the name Joseph saying May the Lord give me another son
Gen  Now after the birth of Joseph Jacob said to Laban Let me go away to my place and my country
Gen  Give me my wives and my children for whom I have been your servant and let me go for you have knowledge of all the work I have done for you
Gen  And Laban said If you will let me say so do not go away for I have seen by the signs that the Lord has been good to me because of you
Gen  Say then what your payment is to be and I will give it
Gen  Then Jacob said You have seen what I have done for you and how your cattle have done well under my care
Gen  For before I came you had little and it has been greatly increased and the Lord has given you a blessing in everything I have done but when am I to do something for my family
Gen  And Laban said What am I to give you And Jacob said Do not give me anything but I will again take up the care of your flock if you will only do this for me
Gen  Let me go through all your flock today taking out from among them all the sheep which are marked or coloured or black and all the marked or coloured goats these will be my payment
Gen  And so you will be able to put my honour to the test in time to come if you see among my flocks any goats which are not marked or coloured or any sheep which is not black you may take me for a thief
Gen  And Laban said Let it be as you say
Gen  So that day he took all the hegoats which were banded or coloured and all the shegoats which were marked or coloured or had white marks and all the black sheep and gave them into the care of his sons
Gen  And sent them three days journey away and Jacob took care of the rest of Labans flock
Gen  Then Jacob took young branches of trees cutting off the skin so that the white wood was seen in bands
Gen  And he put the banded sticks in the drinkingplaces where the flock came to get water and they became with young when they came to the water
Gen  And because of this the flock gave birth to young which were marked with bands of colour
Gen  These lambs Jacob kept separate and he put his flock in a place by themselves and not with Labans flock
Gen  And whenever the stronger ones of the flock became with young Jacob put the sticks in front of them in the drinkingplaces so that they might become with young when they saw the sticks
Gen  But when the flocks were feeble he did not put the sticks before them so that the feebler flocks were Labans and the stronger were Jacobs
Gen  So Jacobs wealth was greatly increased he had great flocks and womenservants and menservants and camels and asses
Gen  Now it came to the ears of Jacob that Labans sons were saying Jacob has taken away all our fathers property and in this way he has got all this wealth
Gen  And Jacob saw that Labans feeling for him was no longer what it had been before
Gen  Then the Lord said to Jacob Go back to the land of your fathers and to your relations and I will be with you
Gen  And Jacob sent for Rachel and Leah to come to him in the field among his flock
Gen  And he said to them It is clear to me that your fathers feeling is no longer what it was to me but the God of my father has been with me
Gen  And you have seen how I have done all in my power for your father
Gen  But your father has not kept faith with me and ten times he has made changes in my payment but God has kept him from doing me damage
Gen  If he said All those in the flock which have marks are to be yours then all the flock gave birth to marked young and if he said All the banded ones are to be yours then all the flock had banded young
Gen  So God has taken away your fathers cattle and has given them to me
Gen  And at the time when the flock were with young I saw in a dream that all the hegoats which were joined with the shegoats were banded and marked and coloured
Gen  And in my dream the angel of the Lord said to me Jacob and I said Here am I
Gen  And he said See how all the hegoats are banded and marked and coloured for I have seen what Laban has done to you
Gen  I am the God of Bethel where you put oil on the pillar and took an oath to me now then come out of this land and go back to the country of your birth
Gen  Then Rachel and Leah said to him in answer What part or heritage is there for us in our fathers house
Gen  Are we not as people from a strange country to him for he took a price for us and now it is all used up
Gen  For the wealth which God has taken from him is ours and our childrens so now whatever God has said to you do
Gen  Then Jacob put his wives and his sons on camels
Gen  And sending on before him all his cattle and his property which he had got together in Paddanaram he made ready to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan
Gen  Now Laban had gone to see to the cutting of the wool of his sheep so Rachel secretly took the images of the gods of her fathers house
Gen  And Jacob went away secretly without giving news of his flight to Laban the Aramaean
Gen  So he went away with all he had and went across the River in the direction of the hillcountry of Gilead
Gen  And on the third day Laban had news of Jacobs flight
Gen  And taking the men of his family with him he went after him for seven days and overtook him in the hillcountry of Gilead
Gen  Then God came to Laban in a dream by night and said to him Take care that you say nothing good or bad to Jacob
Gen  Now when Laban overtook him Jacob had put up his tent in the hillcountry and Laban and his brothers put up their tents in the hillcountry of Gilead
Gen  And Laban said to Jacob Why did you go away secretly taking my daughters away like prisoners of war
Gen  Why did you make a secret of your flight not giving me word of it so that I might have sent you away with joy and songs with melody and music
Gen  You did not even let me give a kiss to my sons and my daughters This was a foolish thing to do
Gen  It is in my power to do you damage but the God of your father came to me this night saying Take care that you say nothing good or bad to Jacob
Gen  And now it seems you are going because your hearts desire is for your fathers house but why have you taken my gods
Gen  And Jacob in answer said to Laban My fear was that you might take your daughters from me by force
Gen  As for your gods if anyone of us has them let him be put to death make search before us all for what is yours and take it For Jacob had no knowledge that Rachel had taken them
Gen  So Laban went into Jacobs tent and into Leahs tent and into the tents of the two servantwomen but they were not there and he came out of Leahs tent and went into Rachels
Gen  Now Rachel had taken the images and had put them in the camels basket and was seated on them And Laban searching through all the tent did not come across them
Gen  And she said to her father Let not my lord be angry because I do not get up before you for I am in the common condition of women And with all his searching he did not come across the images
Gen  Then Jacob was angry with Laban and said What crime or sin have I done that you have come after me with such passion
Gen  Now that you have made search through all my goods what have you seen which is yours Make it clear now before my people and your people so that they may be judges between us
Gen  These twenty years I have been with you your sheep and your goats have had young without loss not one of your hegoats have I taken for food
Gen  Anything which was wounded by beasts I did not take to you but myself made up for the loss of it you made me responsible for whatever was taken by thieves by day or by night
Gen  This was my condition wasted by heat in the day and by the bitter cold at night and sleep went from my eyes
Gen  These twenty years I have been in your house I was your servant for fourteen years because of your daughters and for six years I kept your flock and ten times was my payment changed
Gen  If the God of my father the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac had not been with me you would have sent me away with nothing in my hands But God has seen my troubles and the work of my hands and this night he kept you back
Gen  Then Laban answering said These women are my daughters and these children my children the flocks and all you see are mine what now may I do for my daughters and for their children
Gen  Come let us make an agreement you and I and let it be for a witness between us
Gen  Then Jacob took a stone and put it up as a pillar
Gen  And Jacob said to his people Get stones together and they did so and they had a meal there by the stones
Gen  And the name Laban gave it was Jegarsahadutha but Jacob gave it the name of Galeed
Gen  And Laban said These stones are a witness between you and me today For this reason its name was Galeed
Gen  And Mizpah for he said May the Lord keep watch on us when we are unable to see one anothers doings
Gen  If you are cruel to my daughters or if you take other wives in addition to my daughters then though no man is there to see God will be the witness between us
Gen  And Laban said See these stones and this pillar which I have put between you and me
Gen  They will be witness that I will not go over these stones to you and you will not go over these stones or this pillar to me for any evil purpose
Gen  May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor the God of their father be our judge Then Jacob took an oath by the Fear of his father Isaac
Gen  And Jacob made an offering on the mountain and gave orders to his people to take food so they had a meal and took their rest that night on the mountain
Gen  And early in the morning Laban after kissing and blessing his daughters went on his way back to his country
Gen  And on his way Jacob came face to face with the angels of God
Gen  And when he saw them he said This is the army of God so he gave that place the name of Mahanaim
Gen  Now Jacob sent servants before him to Esau his brother in the land of Seir the country of Edom
Gen  And he gave them orders to say these words to Esau Your servant Jacob says Till now I have been living with Laban
Gen  And I have oxen and asses and flocks and menservants and womenservants and I have sent to give my lord news of these things so that I may have grace in his eyes
Gen  When the servants came back they said We have seen your brother Esau and he is coming out to you and four hundred men with him
Gen  Then Jacob was in great fear and trouble of mind and he put all the people and the flocks and the herds and the camels into two groups
Gen  And said If Esau meeting one group makes an attack on them the others will get away safely
Gen  Then Jacob said O God of my father Abraham the God of my father Isaac the Lord who said to me Go back to your country and your family and I will be good to you
Gen  I am less than nothing in comparison with all your mercies and your faith to me your servant for with only my stick in my hand I went across Jordan and now I have become two armies
Gen  Be my saviour from the hand of Esau my brother for my fear is that he will make an attack on me putting to death mother and child
Gen  And you said Truly I will be good to you and make your seed like the sand of the sea which may not be numbered
Gen  Then he put up his tent there for the night and from among his goods he took as an offering for his brother Esau
Gen  Two hundred shegoats and twenty hegoats two hundred females and twenty males from the sheep
Gen  Thirty camels with their young ones forty cows ten oxen twenty asses and ten young asses
Gen  These he gave to his servants every herd by itself and he said to his servants Go on before me and let there be a space between one herd and another
Gen  And he gave orders to the first saying When my brother Esau comes to you and says Whose servant are you and where are you going and whose are these herds
Gen  Then say to him These are your servant Jacobs they are an offering for my lord for Esau and he himself is coming after us
Gen  And he gave the same orders to the second and the third and to all those who were with the herds saying This is what you are to say to Esau when you see him
Gen  And you are to say further Jacob your servant is coming after us For he said to himself I will take away his wrath by the offering which I have sent on and then I will come before him it may be that I will have grace in his eyes
Gen  So the servants with the offerings went on in front and he himself took his rest that night in the tents with his people
Gen  And in the night he got up and taking with him his two wives and the two servantwomen and his eleven children he went over the river Jabbok
Gen  He took them and sent them over the stream with all he had
Gen  Then Jacob was by himself and a man was fighting with him till dawn
Gen  But when the man saw that he was not able to overcome Jacob he gave him a blow in the hollow part of his leg so that his leg was damaged
Gen  And he said to him Let me go now for the dawn is near But Jacob said I will not let you go till you have given me your blessing
Gen  Then he said What is your name And he said Jacob
Gen  And he said Your name will no longer be Jacob but Israel for in your fight with God and with men you have overcome
Gen  Then Jacob said What is your name And he said What is my name to you Then he gave him a blessing
Gen  And Jacob gave that place the name of Peniel saying I have seen God face to face and still I am living
Gen  And while he was going past Peniel the sun came up And he went with unequal steps because of his damaged leg
Gen  For this reason the children of Israel even today never take that muscle in the hollow of the leg as food because the hollow of Jacobs leg was touched
Gen  Then Jacob lifting up his eyes saw Esau coming with his four hundred men So he made a division of the children between Leah and Rachel and the two womenservants
Gen  He put the servants and their children in front Leah and her children after them and Rachel and Joseph at the back
Gen  And he himself going before them went down on his face to the earth seven times till he came near his brother
Gen  Then Esau came running up to him and folding him in his arms gave him a kiss and the two of them were overcome with weeping
Gen  Then Esau lifting up his eyes saw the women and the children and said Who are these with you And he said The children whom God in his mercy has given to your servant
Gen  Then the servants and their children came near and went down on their faces
Gen  And Leah came near with her children and then Joseph and Rachel and they did the same
Gen  And he said What were all those herds which I saw on the way And Jacob said They were an offering so that I might have grace in my lords eyes
Gen  But Esau said I have enough keep what is yours my brother for yourself
Gen  And Jacob said Not so but if I have grace in your eyes take them as a sign of my love for I have seen your face as one may see the face of God and you have been pleased with me
Gen  Take my offering then with my blessing for God has been very good to me and I have enough so at his strong request he took it
Gen  And he said Let us go on our journey together and I will go in front
Gen  But Jacob said My lord may see that the children are only small and there are young ones in my flocks and herds one days overdriving will be the destruction of all the flock
Gen  Do you my lord go on before your servant I will come on slowly at the rate at which the cattle and the children are able to go till I come to my lord at Seir
Gen  And Esau said Then keep some of my men with you And he said What need is there for that if my lord is pleased with me
Gen  So Esau turning back that day went on his way to Seir
Gen  And Jacob went on to Succoth where he made a house for himself and put up tents for his cattle for this reason the place was named Succoth
Gen  So Jacob came safely from Paddanaram to the town of Shechem in the land of Canaan and put up his tents near the town
Gen  And for a hundred bits of money he got from the children of Hamor the builder of Shechem the field in which he had put up his tents
Gen  And there he put up an altar naming it El the God of Israel
Gen  Now Dinah the daughter whom Leah had by Jacob went out to see the women of that country
Gen  And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite who was the chief of that land saw her he took her by force and had connection with her
Gen  Then his heart went out in love to Dinah the daughter of Jacob and he said comforting words to her
Gen  And Shechem said to Hamor his father Get me this girl for my wife
Gen  Now Jacob had word of what Shechem had done to his daughter but his sons were in the fields with the cattle and Jacob said nothing till they came
Gen  Then Hamor the father of Shechem came out to have a talk with Jacob
Gen  Now the sons of Jacob came in from the fields when they had news of it and they were wounded and very angry because of the shame he had done in Israel by having connection with Jacobs daughter and they said Such a thing is not to be done
Gen  But Hamor said to them Shechem my son is full of desire for your daughter will you then give her to him for a wife
Gen  And let our two peoples be joined together give your daughters to us and take our daughters for yourselves
Gen  Go on living with us and the country will be open to you do trade and get property there
Gen  And Shechem said to her father and her brothers If you will give ear to my request whatever you say I will give to you
Gen  However great you make the brideprice and payment I will give it only let me have the girl for my wife
Gen  But the sons of Jacob gave a false answer to Shechem and Hamor his father because of what had been done to Dinah their sister
Gen  And they said It is not possible for us to give our sister to one who is without circumcision for that would be a cause of shame to us
Gen  But on this condition only will we come to an agreement with you if every male among you becomes like us and undergoes circumcision
Gen  Then we will give our daughters to you and take your daughters to us and go on living with you as one people
Gen  But if you will not undergo circumcision as we say then we will take our daughter and go
Gen  And their words were pleasing to Hamor and his son Shechem
Gen  And without loss of time the young man did as they said because he had delight in Jacobs daughter and he was the noblest of his fathers house
Gen  Then Hamor and Shechem his son went to the meetingplace of their town and said to the men of the town
Gen  It is the desire of these men to be at peace with us let them then go on living in this country and doing trade here for the country is wide open before them let us take their daughters as wives and let us give them our daughters
Gen  But these men will make an agreement with us to go on living with us and to become one people only on the condition that every male among us undergoes circumcision as they have done
Gen  Then will not their cattle and their goods and all their beasts be ours so let us come to an agreement with them so that they may go on living with us
Gen  Then all the men of the town gave ear to the words of Hamor and Shechem his son and every male in the town underwent circumcision
Gen  But on the third day after before the wounds were well two of the sons of Jacob Simeon and Levi Dinahs brothers took their swords and came into the town by surprise and put all the males to death
Gen  And Hamor and his son they put to death with the sword and they took Dinah from Shechems house and went away
Gen  And the sons of Jacob came on them when they were wounded and made waste the town because of what had been done to their sister
Gen  They took their flocks and their herds and their asses and everything in their town and in their fields
Gen  And all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives everything in their houses they took and made them waste
Gen  And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi You have made trouble for me and given me a bad name among the people of this country among the Canaanites and the Perizzites and because we are small in number they will come together against me and make war on me and it will be the end of me and all my people
Gen  But they said Were we to let him make use of our sister as a loose woman
Gen  And God said to Jacob Go up now to Bethel and make your livingplace there and put up an altar there to the God who came to you when you were in flight from your brother Esau
Gen  Then Jacob said to all his people Put away the strange gods which are among you and make yourselves clean and put on a change of clothing
Gen  And let us go up to Bethel and there I will make an altar to God who gave me an answer in the day of my trouble and was with me wherever I went
Gen  Then they gave to Jacob all the strange gods which they had and the rings which were in their ears and Jacob put them away under the holy tree at Shechem
Gen  So they went on their journey and the fear of God was on the towns round about so that they made no attack on the sons of Jacob
Gen  And Jacob came to Luz in the land of Canaan which is the same as Bethel he and all his people
Gen  And there he made an altar naming the place Elbethel because it was there he had the vision of God when he was in flight from his brother
Gen  And Deborah the servant who had taken care of Rebekah from her birth came to her end and was put to rest near Bethel under the holy tree and they gave it the name of Allonbacuth
Gen  Now when Jacob was on his way from Paddanaram God came to him again and blessing him said
Gen  Jacob is your name but it will be so no longer from now your name will be Israel so he was named Israel
Gen  And God said to him I am God the Ruler of all be fertile and have increase a nation truly a group of nations will come from you and kings will be your offspring
Gen  And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you and to your seed after you I will give the land
Gen  Then God went up from him in the place where he had been talking with him
Gen  And Jacob put up a pillar in the place where he had been talking with God and put a drink offering on it and oil
Gen  And he gave to the place where God had been talking with him the name of Bethel
Gen  So they went on from Bethel and while they were still some distance from Ephrath the pains of birth came on Rachel and she had a hard time
Gen  And when her pain was very great the woman who was helping her said Have no fear for now you will have another son
Gen  And in the hour when her life went from her for death came to her she gave the child the name Benoni but his father gave him the name of Benjamin
Gen  So Rachel came to her end and was put to rest on the road to Ephrath which is Bethlehem
Gen  And Jacob put up a pillar on her restingplace which is named The Pillar of the restingplace of Rachel to this day
Gen  And Israel went journeying on and put up his tents on the other side of the tower of the flock
Gen  Now while they were living in that country Reuben had connection with Bilhah his fathers servantwoman and Israel had news of it
Gen  Now Jacob had twelve sons the sons of Leah Reuben Jacobs first son and Simeon and Levi and Judah and Issachar and Zebulun
Gen  The sons of Rachel Joseph and Benjamin
Gen  The sons of Bilhah Rachels servant Dan and Naphtali
Gen  The sons of Zilpah Leahs servant Gad and Asher these are the sons whom Jacob had in Paddanaram
Gen  And Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre at Kiriatharba that is Hebron where Abraham and Isaac had been living
Gen  And Isaac was a hundred and eighty years old
Gen  Then Isaac came to his end and was put to rest with his fathers people an old man after a long life and Jacob and Esau his sons put him in his last restingplace
Gen  Now these are the generations of Esau that is to say Edom
Gen  Esaus wives were women of Canaan Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite
Gen  And Basemath Ishmaels daughter the sister of Nebaioth
Gen  Adah had a son Eliphaz and Basemath was the mother of Reuel
Gen  Oholibamah was the mother of Jeush Jalam and Korah these are the sons of Esau whose birth took place in the land of Canaan
Gen  Esau took his wives and his sons and his daughters and all the people of his house and his beasts and his cattle and all his goods which he had got together in the land of Canaan and went into the land of Seir away from his brother Jacob
Gen  For their wealth was so great that the land was not wide enough for the two of them and all their cattle
Gen  So Esau made his livingplace in the hillcountry of Seir Esau is Edom
Gen  And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in the hillcountry of Seir
Gen  These are the names of Esaus sons Eliphaz the son of Esaus wife Adah and Reuel the son of Esaus wife Basemath
Gen  The sons of Eliphaz were Teman Omar Zepho Gatam and Kenaz
Gen  And Eliphaz the son of Esau had connection with a woman named Timna who gave birth to Amalek all these were the children of Esaus wife Adah
Gen  And these are the sons of Reuel Nahath Zerah Shammah and Mizzah they were the children of Esaus wife Basemath
Gen  And these are the sons of Esaus wife Oholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon she was the mother of Jeush Jalam and Korah

Gen  These were the sons of Esau that is Edom and these were their chiefs
Gen  These are the sons of Seir the Horite who were living in that country Lotan Shobal Zibeon Anah
Gen  Dishon Ezer and Dishan these are the chiefs of the Horites offspring of Seir in the land of Edom
Gen  The children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam Lotans sister was Timna
Gen  And these are the children of Shobal Alvan Manahath Ebal Shepho and Onam
Gen  And these are the children of Zibeon Aiah and Anah that same Anah who made the discovery of the watersprings in the waste land when he was looking after the asses of his father Zibeon
Gen  And these are the children of Anah Dishon and Oholibamah his daughter
Gen  These are the children of Dishon Hemdan Eshban Ithran and Keran
Gen  These are the children of Ezer Bilhan Zaavan and Akan
Gen  These are the children of Dishan Uz and Aran
Gen  These were the Horite chiefs Lotan Shobal Zibeon Anah
Gen  Dishon Ezer and Dishan Such were the Horite chiefs in their order in the land of Seir
Gen  And these are the kings who were ruling in the land of Edom before there was any king over the children of Israel
Gen  Bela son of Beor was king in Edom and the name of his chief town was Dinhabah
Gen  At his death Jobab son of Zerah of Bozrah became king in his place
Gen  And at the death of Jobab Husham from the country of the Temanites became king in his place

Gen  And at the death of Baalhanan Hadar became king in his place his chief town was named Pau and his wifes name was Mehetabel she was the daughter of Matred the daughter of Mezahab
Gen  These are the names of the chiefs of Esau in the order of their families and their places Timna Alvah Jetheth
Gen  Oholibamah Elah Pinon
Gen  Kenaz Teman Mibzar
Gen  Magdiel Iram these are the Edomite chiefs in their places in their heritage this is Esau the father of the Edomites
Gen  Now Jacob was living in the land where his father had made a place for himself in the land of Canaan
Gen  These are the generations of Jacob Joseph a boy seventeen years old was looking after the flock together with his brothers the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah his fathers wives and Joseph gave their father a bad account of them
Gen  Now the love which Israel had for Joseph was greater than his love for all his other children because he got him when he was an old man and he had a long coat made for him
Gen  And because his brothers saw that Joseph was dearer to his father than all the others they were full of hate for him and would not say a kind word to him
Gen  Now Joseph had a dream and he gave his brothers an account of it which made their hate greater than ever
Gen  And he said to them Let me give you the story of my dream
Gen  We were in the field getting the grain stems together and my grain kept upright and yours came round and went down on the earth before mine
Gen  And his brothers said to him Are you to be our king will you have authority over us And because of his dream and his words their hate for him became greater than ever
Gen  Then he had another dream and gave his brothers an account of it saying I have had another dream the sun and the moon and eleven stars gave honour to me
Gen  And he gave word of it to his father and his brothers but his father protesting said What sort of a dream is this am I and your mother and your brothers to go down on our faces to the earth before you
Gen  And his brothers were full of envy but his father kept his words in mind
Gen  Now his brothers went to keep watch over their fathers flock in Shechem
Gen  And Israel said to Joseph Are not your brothers with the flock in Shechem come I will send you to them And he said to him Here am I
Gen  And he said to him Go now and see if your brothers are well and how the flock is then come back and give me word So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron and he came to Shechem
Gen  And a man saw him wandering in the country and said to him What are you looking for
Gen  And he said I am looking for my brothers please give me word of where they are keeping their flock
Gen  And the man said They have gone away from here for they said in my hearing Let us go to Dothan So Joseph went after them and came up with them at Dothan
Gen  But they saw him when he was a long way off and before he came near them they made a secret design against him to put him to death
Gen  Saying to one another See here comes this dreamer
Gen  Let us now put him to death and put his body into one of these holes and we will say An evil beast has put him to death then we will see what becomes of his dreams
Gen  But Reuben hearing these words got him out of their hands saying Let us not take his life
Gen  Do not put him to a violent death but let him be placed in one of the holes this he said to keep him safe from their hands with the purpose of taking him back to his father again
Gen  So when Joseph came to his brothers they took off his long coat which he had on
Gen  And they took him and put him in the hole now the hole had no water in it
Gen  Then seating themselves they took their meal and looking up they saw a travelling band of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead on their way to Egypt with spices and perfumes on their camels
Gen  And Judah said to his brothers What profit is there in putting our brother to death and covering up his blood
Gen  Let us give him to these Ishmaelites for a price and let us not put violent hands on him for he is our brother our flesh And his brothers gave ear to him
Gen  And some traders from Midian went by so pulling Joseph up out of the hole they gave him to the Ishmaelites for twenty bits of silver and they took him to Egypt
Gen  Now when Reuben came back to the hole Joseph was not there and giving signs of grief
Gen  He went back to his brothers and said The child is gone what am I to do
Gen  Then they took Josephs coat and put on it some of the blood from a young goat which they had put to death
Gen  And they took the coat to their father and said We came across this is it your sons coat or not
Gen  And he saw that it was and said It is my sons coat an evil beast has put him to death without doubt Joseph has come to a cruel end
Gen  Then Jacob giving signs of grief put on haircloth and went on weeping for his son day after day
Gen  And all his sons and all his daughters came to give him comfort but he would not be comforted saying with weeping I will go down to the underworld to my son So great was his fathers sorrow for him
Gen  And in Egypt the men of Midian gave him for a price to Potiphar a captain of high position in Pharaohs house
Gen  Now at that time Judah went away from his brothers and became the friend of a man of Adullam named Hirah
Gen  And there he saw the daughter of a certain man of Canaan named Shua and took her as his wife
Gen  And she gave birth to a son and he gave him the name Er
Gen  And again she gave birth to a son and he gave him the name Onan
Gen  Then she had another son to whom she gave the name Shelah she was at Chezib when the birth took place
Gen  And Judah took a wife for his first son Er and her name was Tamar
Gen  Now Er Judahs first son did evil in the eyes of the Lord so that he put him to death
Gen  Then Judah said to Onan Go in to your brothers wife and do what it is right for a husbands brother to do make her your wife and get offspring for your brother
Gen  But Onan seeing that the offspring would not be his went in to his brothers wife but let his seed go on to the earth so that he might not get offspring for his brother
Gen  And what he did was evil in the eyes of the Lord so that he put him to death like his brother
Gen  Then Judah said to Tamar his daughterinlaw Go back to your fathers house and keep yourself as a widow till my son Shelah becomes a man for he had in his mind the thought that death might come to him as it had come to his brothers So Tamar went back to her fathers house
Gen  And after a time Bathshua Judahs wife came to her end and after Judah was comforted for her loss he went to Timnah where they were cutting the wool of his sheep and his friend Hirah of Adullam went with him
Gen  And when Tamar had news that her fatherinlaw was going up to Timnah to the woolcutting
Gen  She took off her widows clothing and covering herself with her veil she took her seat near Enaim on the road to Timnah for she saw that Shelah was now a man but she had not been made his wife
Gen  When Judah saw her he took her to be a loose woman of the town because her face was covered
Gen  And turning to her by the roadside he said to her Let me come in to you for he had no idea that she was his daughterinlaw And she said What will you give me as my price
Gen  And he said I will give you a young goat from the flock And she said What will you give me as a sign till you send it
Gen  And he said What would you have And she said Your ring and its cord and the stick in your hand So he gave them to her and went in to her and she became with child by him
Gen  Then she got up and went away and took off her veil and put on her widows clothing
Gen  Then Judah sent his friend Hirah with the young goat to get back the things which he had given as a sign to the woman but she was not there
Gen  And he put questions to the men of the place saying Where is the loose woman who was in Enaim by the wayside And they said There was no such woman there
Gen  So he went back to Judah and said I have not seen her and the men of the place say that there is no such woman there
Gen  And Judah said Let her keep the things so that we may not be shamed I sent the young goat but you did not see the woman
Gen  Now about three months after this word came to Judah that Tamar his daughterinlaw had been acting like a loose woman and was with child And Judah said Take her out and let her be burned
Gen  And while she was being taken out she sent word to her fatherinlaw saying The man whose property these things are is the father of my child say then whose are this ring and this cord and this stick
Gen  Then Judah said openly that they were his and said She is more upright than I am for I did not give her to Shelah my son And he had no more connection with her
Gen  And when the time came for her to give birth it was clear that there were two children in her body
Gen  And while she was in the act of giving birth one of them put out his hand and the woman who was with her put a red thread round his hand saying This one came out first
Gen  But then he took his hand back again and his brother came first to birth and the woman said What an opening you have made for yourself So he was named Perez
Gen  And then his brother came out with the red thread round his hand and he was named Zerah
Gen  Now Joseph was taken down to Egypt and Potiphar the Egyptian a captain of high position in Pharaohs house got him for a price from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there
Gen  And the Lord was with Joseph and he did well and he was living in the house of his master the Egyptian
Gen  And his master saw that the Lord was with him making everything he did go well
Gen  And having a high opinion of Joseph as his servant he made him the overseer of his house and gave him control over all he had
Gen  And from the time when he made him overseer and gave him control of all his property the blessing of the Lord was with the Egyptian because of Joseph the blessing of the Lord was on all he had in the house and in the field
Gen  And he gave Joseph control of all his property keeping no account of anything but only the food which was put before him Now Joseph was very beautiful in form and face
Gen  And after a time his masters wife looking on Joseph with desire said to him Be my lover
Gen  But he would not and said to her You see that my master keeps no account of what I do in his house and has put all his property in my control
Gen  So that no one has more authority in this house than I have he has kept nothing back from me but you because you are his wife how then may I do this great wrong sinning against God
Gen  And day after day she went on requesting Joseph to come to her and be her lover but he would not give ear to her
Gen  Now one day he went into the house to do his work and not one of the men of the house was inside
Gen  And pulling at his coat she said Come to my bed but slipping out of his coat he went running away
Gen  And when she saw that he had got away letting her keep his coat
Gen  She sent for the men of her house and said to them See he has let a Hebrew come here and make sport of us he came to my bed and I gave a loud cry
Gen  And hearing it he went running out without his coat
Gen  And she kept his coat by her till his master came back
Gen  Then she gave him the same story saying The Hebrew servant whom you have taken into our house came in to make sport of me
Gen  And when I gave a loud cry he went running out without his coat
Gen  And hearing his wifes account of what his servant had done he became very angry
Gen  And Josephs master took him and put him in prison in the place where the kings prisoners were kept in chains and he was there in the prisonhouse
Gen  But the Lord was with Joseph and was good to him and made the keeper of the prison his friend
Gen  And the keeper of the prison put all the prisoners under Josephs control and he was responsible for whatever was done there
Gen  And the keeper of the prison gave no attention to anything which was under his care because the Lord was with him and the Lord made everything he did go well
Gen  Now after these things the chief servant who had the care of the wine and the chief breadmaker in Pharaohs house did something against Pharaohs orders
Gen  And Pharaoh was angry with his two servants with the chief wineservant and the chief breadmaker
Gen  And he put them in prison under the care of the captain of the army in the same prison where Joseph himself was shut up
Gen  And the captain put them in Josephs care and he did what was needed for them and they were kept in prison for some time
Gen  And these two had a dream on the same night the chief wineservant and the chief breadmaker of the king of Egypt who were in prison the two of them had dreams with a special sense
Gen  And in the morning when Joseph came to them he saw that they were looking sad
Gen  And he said to the servants of Pharaoh who were in prison with him Why are you looking so sad
Gen  Then they said to him We have had a dream and no one is able to give us the sense And Joseph said Does not the sense of dreams come from God what was your dream
Gen  Then the chief wineservant gave Joseph an account of his dream and said In my dream I saw a vine before me
Gen  And on the vine were three branches and it seemed as if it put out buds and flowers and from them came grapes ready for cutting
Gen  And Pharaohs cup was in my hand and I took the grapes and crushing them into Pharaohs cup gave the cup into Pharaohs hand
Gen  Then Joseph said This is the sense of your dream the three branches are three days
Gen  After three days Pharaoh will give you honour and put you back into your place and you will give him his cup as you did before when you were his wineservant
Gen  But keep me in mind when things go well for you and be good to me and say a good word for me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison
Gen  For truly I was taken by force from the land of the Hebrews and I have done nothing for which I might be put in prison
Gen  Now when the chief breadmaker saw that the first dream had a good sense he said to Joseph I had a dream and in my dream there were three baskets of white bread on my head
Gen  And in the top basket were all sorts of cooked meats for Pharaoh and the birds were taking them out of the baskets on my head
Gen  Then Joseph said This is the sense of your dream the three baskets are three days
Gen  After three days Pharaoh will take you out of prison hanging you on a tree so that your flesh will be food for birds
Gen  Now the third day was Pharaohs birthday and he gave a feast for all his servants and he gave honour to the chief wineservant and the chief breadmaker among the others
Gen  And he put the chief wineservant back in his old place and he gave the cup into Pharaohs hand
Gen  But the chief breadmaker was put to death by hanging as Joseph had said
Gen  But the wineservant did not keep Joseph in mind or give a thought to him
Gen  Now after two years had gone by Pharaoh had a dream and in his dream he was by the side of the Nile
Gen  And out of the Nile came seven cows goodlooking and fat and their food was the rivergrass
Gen  And after them seven other cows came out of the Nile poorlooking and thin and they were by the side of the other cows
Gen  And the seven thin cows made a meal of the seven fat cows Then Pharaoh came out of his sleep
Gen  But he went to sleep again and had a second dream in which he saw seven heads of grain full and good all on one stem
Gen  And after them came up seven other heads thin and wasted by the east wind
Gen  And the seven thin heads made a meal of the good heads And when Pharaoh was awake he saw it was a dream
Gen  And in the morning his spirit was troubled and he sent for all the wise men of Egypt and all the holy men and put his dream before them but no one was able to give him the sense of it
Gen  Then the chief wineservant said to Pharaoh The memory of my sin comes back to me now
Gen  Pharaoh had been angry with his servants and had put me in prison in the house of the captain of the army together with the chief breadmaker
Gen  And we had a dream on the same night the two of us and the dreams had a special sense
Gen  And there was with us a young Hebrew the captains servant and when we put our dreams before him he gave us the sense of them
Gen  And it came about as he said I was put back in my place and the breadmaker was put to death by hanging
Gen  Then Pharaoh sent for Joseph and they took him quickly out of prison and when his hair had been cut and his dress changed he came before Pharaoh
Gen  And Pharaoh said to Joseph I have had a dream and no one is able to give me the sense of it now it has come to my ears that you are able to give the sense of a dream when it is put before you
Gen  Then Joseph said Without God there will be no answer of peace for Pharaoh
Gen  Then Pharaoh said In my dream I was by the side of the Nile
Gen  And out of the Nile came seven cows fat and goodlooking and their food was the rivergrass
Gen  Then after them came seven other cows very thin and poorlooking worse than any I ever saw in the land of Egypt
Gen  And the thin cows made a meal of the seven fat cows who came up first
Gen  And even with the fat cows inside them they seemed as bad as before And so I came out of my sleep
Gen  And again in a dream I saw seven heads of grain full and good coming up on one stem
Gen  And then I saw seven other heads dry thin and wasted by the east wind coming up after them
Gen  And the seven thin heads made a meal of the seven good heads and I put this dream before the wise men but not one of them was able to give me the sense of it
Gen  Then Joseph said These two dreams have the same sense God has made clear to Pharaoh what he is about to do
Gen  The seven fat cows are seven years and the seven good heads of grain are seven years the two have the same sense
Gen  The seven thin and poorlooking cows who came up after them are seven years and the seven heads of grain dry and wasted by the east wind are seven years when there will be no food
Gen  As I said to Pharaoh before God has made clear to him what he is about to do
Gen  Seven years are coming in which there will be great wealth of grain in Egypt
Gen  And after that will come seven years when there will not be enough food and the memory of the good years will go from mens minds and the land will be made waste by the bad years
Gen  And men will have no memory of the good time because of the need which will come after for it will be very bitter
Gen  And this dream came to Pharaoh twice because this thing is certain and God will quickly make it come about
Gen  And now let Pharaoh make search for a man of wisdom and good sense and put him in authority over the land of Egypt
Gen  Let Pharaoh do this and let him put overseers over the land of Egypt to put in store a fifth part of the produce of the land in the good years
Gen  And let them get together all the food in those good years and make a store of grain under Pharaohs control for the use of the towns and let them keep it
Gen  And let that food be kept in store for the land till the seven bad years which are to come in Egypt so that the land may not come to destruction through need of food
Gen  And this seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his servants
Gen  Then Pharaoh said to his servants Where may we get such a man as this a man in whom is the spirit of God
Gen  And Pharaoh said to Joseph Seeing that God has made all this clear to you there is no other man of such wisdom and good sense as you
Gen  You then are to be over my house and all my people will be ruled by your word only as king will I be greater than you
Gen  And Pharaoh said to Joseph See I have put you over all the land of Egypt
Gen  Then Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it on Josephs hand and he had him clothed with the best linen and put a chain of gold round his neck
Gen  And he made him take his seat in the second of his carriages and they went before him crying Make way So he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt
Gen  Then Pharaoh said to Joseph I am Pharaoh and without your order no man may do anything in all the land of Egypt
Gen  And Pharaoh gave Joseph the name of Zaphnathpaaneah and he gave him Asenath the daughter of Potiphera the priest of On to be his wife So Joseph went through all the land of Egypt
Gen  Now Joseph was thirty years old when he came before Pharaoh king of Egypt And Joseph went out from before the face of Pharaoh and went through all the land of Egypt
Gen  Now in the seven good years the earth gave fruit in masses
Gen  And Joseph got together all the food of those seven years and made a store of food in the towns the produce of the fields round every town was stored up in the town
Gen  So he got together a store of grain like the sand of the sea so great a store that after a time he gave up measuring it for it might not be measured
Gen  And before the time of need Joseph had two sons to whom Asenath the daughter of Potiphera priest of On gave birth
Gen  And to the first he gave the name Manasseh for he said God has taken away from me all memory of my hard life and of my fathers house
Gen  And to the second he gave the name Ephraim for he said God has given me fruit in the land of my sorrow
Gen  And so the seven good years in Egypt came to an end
Gen  Then came the first of the seven years of need as Joseph had said and in every other land they were short of food but in the land of Egypt there was bread
Gen  And when all the land of Egypt was in need of food the people came crying to Pharaoh for bread and Pharaoh said to the people Go to Joseph and whatever he says to you do it
Gen  And everywhere on the earth they were short of food then Joseph opening all his storehouses gave the people of Egypt grain for money so great was the need of food in the land of Egypt
Gen  And all lands sent to Egypt to Joseph to get grain for the need was great over all the earth
Gen  Now Jacob hearing that there was grain in Egypt said to his sons Why are you looking at one another
Gen  And he said I have had news that there is grain in Egypt go down there and get grain for us so that life and not death may be ours
Gen  So Josephs ten brothers went down to get grain from Egypt
Gen  But Jacob did not send Benjamin Josephs brother with them for fear as he said that some evil might come to him
Gen  And the sons of Israel came with all the others to get grain for they were very short of food in the land of Canaan
Gen  Now Joseph was ruler over all the land and it was he who gave out the grain to all the people of the land and Josephs brothers came before him and went down on their faces to the earth
Gen  And when Joseph saw his brothers it was clear to him who they were but he made himself strange to them and talking roughly to them said Where do you come from And they said From the land of Canaan to get food
Gen  Now though Joseph saw that these were his brothers they had no idea who he was
Gen  Then the memory of his dreams about them came back to Joseph and he said to them You have come secretly to see how poor the land is
Gen  And they said to him Not so my lord your servants have come with money to get food
Gen  We are all one mans sons we are true men we have not come with any secret purpose
Gen  And he said to them No but you have come to see how poor the land is
Gen  Then they said We your servants are twelve brothers sons of one man in the land of Canaan the youngest of us is now with our father and one is dead
Gen  And Joseph said It is as I said you have come with some secret purpose
Gen  But in this way will you be put to the test by the life of Pharaoh you will not go away from this place till your youngest brother comes here
Gen  Send one of your number to get your brother and the rest of you will be kept in prison so that your words may be tested to see if you are true if not by the life of Pharaoh your purpose is certainly secret
Gen  So he put them in prison for three days
Gen  And on the third day Joseph said to them Do this if you would keep your lives for I am a godfearing man
Gen  If you are true men let one of you be kept in prison while you go and take grain for the needs of your families
Gen  And come back to me with your youngest brother so that your words may be seen to be true and you will not be put to death This is what you are to do
Gen  And they said to one another Truly we did wrong to our brother for we saw his grief of mind and we did not give ear to his prayers that is why this trouble has come on us
Gen  And Reuben said to them Did I not say to you Do the child no wrong but you gave no attention so now punishment has come on us for his blood
Gen  They were not conscious that the sense of their words was clear to Joseph for he had been talking to them through one who had knowledge of their language
Gen  And turning away from them he was overcome with weeping then he went on talking to them again and took Simeon and put chains on him before their eyes
Gen  Then Joseph gave orders for their bags to be made full of grain and for every mans money to be put back into his bag and for food to be given them for the journey which was done
Gen  Then they put the bags of grain on their asses and went away
Gen  Now at their nights restingplace one of them opening his bag to give his ass some food saw his money in the mouth of the bag
Gen  And he said to his brothers My money has been given back it is in my bag then their hearts became full of fear and turning to one another they said What is this which God has done to us
Gen  So when they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan they gave him an account of all their experiences saying
Gen  The man who is the ruler of the country was rough with us and put us in prison saying that we had come with a secret evil purpose
Gen  And we said to him We are true men we have no evil designs
Gen  We are twelve brothers sons of our father one is dead and the youngest is now with our father in the land of Canaan
Gen  And the ruler of the land said In this way I may be certain that you are true men let one of you be kept here with me while you go and take grain for the needs of your families
Gen  And come back to me with your youngest brother then I will be certain that you are true men and I will give your brother back to you and let you do trade in the land
Gen  And when they took the grain out of their bags it was seen that every mans parcel of money was in his bag and when they and their father saw the money they were full of fear
Gen  And Jacob their father said to them You have taken my children from me Joseph is gone and Simeon is gone and now you would take Benjamin away all these things have come on me
Gen  And Reuben said Put my two sons to death if I do not come back to you with him let him be in my care and I will give him safely back to you
Gen  And he said I will not let my son go down with you for his brother is dead and he is all I have if evil overtakes him on the journey then through you will my grey head go down to the underworld in sorrow
Gen  Now the land was in bitter need of food
Gen  And when the grain which they had got in Egypt was all used up their father said to them Go again and get us a little food
Gen  And Judah said to him The man said to us with an oath You are not to come before me again without your brother
Gen  If you will let our brother go with us we will go down and get food
Gen  But if you will not send him we will not go down for the man said to us You are not to come before me if your brother is not with you
Gen  And Israel said Why were you so cruel to me as to say to him that you had a brother
Gen  And they said The man put a number of questions to us about ourselves and our family saying Is your father still living have you another brother And we had to give him answers how were we to have any idea that he would say Come back with your brother
Gen  Then Judah said to Israel his father Send the boy with me and let us be up and going so that we and you and our little ones may not come to destruction
Gen  Put him into my care and make me responsible for him if I do not give him safely back to you let mine be the sin for ever
Gen  Truly if we had not let the time go by we might have come back again by now
Gen  Then their father Israel said to them If it has to be so then do this take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels to give the man perfumes and honey and spices and nuts
Gen  And take twice as much money with you that is to say take back the money which was put in your bags for it may have been an error
Gen  And take your brother and go back to the man
Gen  And may God the Ruler of all give you mercy before the man so that he may give you back your other brother and Benjamin If my children are to be taken from me there is no help for it
Gen  So they took what their father said for the man and twice as much money in their hands and Benjamin and went on their journey to Egypt and came before Joseph
Gen  And when Joseph saw Benjamin he said to his chief servant Take these men into my house and make ready a meal for they will take food with me in the middle of the day
Gen  And the servant did as Joseph said and took the men into Josephs house
Gen  Now the men were full of fear because they had been taken into Josephs house and they said It is because of the money which was put back in our bags the first time he is looking for something against us so that he may come down on us and take us and our asses for his use
Gen  So they went up to Josephs chief servant at the door of the house
Gen  And said O my lord we only came down the first time to get food
Gen  And when we came to our nights restingplace on opening our bags we saw that every mans money was in the mouth of his bag all our money in full weight and we have it with us to give it back
Gen  As well as more money with which to get food we have no idea who put our money in our bags
Gen  Then the servant said Peace be with you have no fear your God even the God of your father has put wealth in your bags for you I had your money Then he let Simeon come out to them
Gen  And the servant took them into Josephs house and gave them water for washing their feet and he gave their asses food
Gen  And they got ready the things for Joseph before he came in the middle of the day for word was given to them that they were to have a meal there
Gen  And when Joseph came in they gave him the things which they had for him and went down to the earth before him
Gen  And he said How are you is your father well the old man of whom you were talking to me is he still living
Gen  And they said Your servant our father is well he is still living And they went down on their faces before him
Gen  Then lifting up his eyes he saw Benjamin his brother his mothers son and he said Is this your youngest brother of whom you gave me word And he said God be good to you my son
Gen  Then Josephs heart went out to his brother and he went quickly into his room for he was overcome with weeping
Gen  Then after washing his face he came out and controlling his feelings said Put food before us
Gen  And they put a meal ready for him by himself and for them by themselves and for the Egyptians who were with him by themselves because the Egyptians may not take food with the Hebrews for that would make them unclean
Gen  And they were all given their seats before him in order of birth from the oldest to the youngest so that they were looking at one another in wonder
Gen  And Joseph sent food to them from his table but he sent five times as much to Benjamin as to any of the others And they took wine freely with him
Gen  Then he gave orders to the servant who was over his house saying Put as much food into the mens bags as will go into them and put every mans money in the mouth of his bag
Gen  And put my cup my silver cup in the youngest ones bag with his money So he did as Joseph said
Gen  And at dawn the men with their asses were sent away
Gen  And when they had gone only a little way out of the town Joseph said to the servant who was over his house Go after them and when you overtake them say to them Why have you done evil in reward for good
Gen  Is not this the cup from which my lord takes wine and by which he gets knowledge of the future Truly you have done evil
Gen  So he overtook them and said these words to them
Gen  And they said to him Why does my lord say such words as these far be it from your servants to do such a thing
Gen  See the money which was in the mouth of our bags we gave back to you when we came again from Canaan how then might we take silver or gold from your lords house
Gen  If it comes to light that any of your servants has done this let him be put to death and we will be your lords servants
Gen  And he said Let it be as you say he in whose bag it is seen will become my servant and you will not be responsible
Gen  Then every man quickly got his bag down and undid it
Gen  And he made a search starting with the oldest and ending with the youngest and the cup was in Benjamins bag
Gen  Then in bitter grief they put the bags on the asses again and went back to the town
Gen  So Judah and his brothers came to Josephs house and he was still there and they went down on their faces before him
Gen  And Joseph said What is this thing which you have done had you no thought that such a man as I would have power to see what is secret
Gen  And Judah said What are we to say to my lord how may we put ourselves right in his eyes God has made clear the sin of your servants now we are in your hands we and the man in whose bag your cup was seen
Gen  Then he said Far be it from me to do so but the man who had my cup will be my servant and you may go back to your father in peace
Gen  Then Judah came near him and said Let your servant say a word in my lords ears and let not your wrath be burning against your servant for you are in the place of Pharaoh to us
Gen  My lord said to his servants Have you a father or a brother
Gen  And we said to my lord We have an old father and a young child whom he had when he was old his brother is dead and he is the only son of his mother and is very dear to his father
Gen  And you said to your servants Let him come down to me with you so that I may see him
Gen  And we said to my lord His father will not let him go for if he went away his father would come to his death
Gen  But you said to your servants If your youngest brother does not come with you you will not see my face again
Gen  And when we went back to your servant our father we gave him an account of my lords words
Gen  And our father said Go again and get us a little food
Gen  And we said Only if our youngest brother goes with us will we go down for we may not see the mans face again if our youngest brother is not with us
Gen  And our father said to us You have knowledge that my wife gave me two sons
Gen  The one went away from me and I said Truly he has come to a violent death and from that time I have not seen him
Gen  If now you take this one from me and some evil comes to him you will make my grey head go down in sorrow to the underworld
Gen  If then I go back to your servant my father without the boy because his life and the boys life are one
Gen  When he sees that the boy is not with us he will come to his death and our fathers grey head will go down in sorrow to the underworld
Gen  For I made myself responsible for the boy to my father saying If I do not give him safely back to you let mine be the sin for ever
Gen  So now let me be my lords servant here in place of the boy and let him go back with his brothers
Gen  For how may I go back to my father without the boy and see the evil which will come on my father
Gen  Then Joseph unable to keep back his feelings before those who were with him gave orders for everyone to be sent away and no one was present when he made clear to his brothers who he was
Gen  And so loud was his weeping that it came to the ears of the Egyptians and all Pharaohs house
Gen  And Joseph said to his brothers I am Joseph is my father still living But his brothers were not able to give him an answer for they were troubled before him
Gen  Then Joseph said to his brothers Come near to me And they came near And he said I am Joseph your brother whom you sent into Egypt
Gen  Now do not be troubled or angry with yourselves for sending me away because God sent me before you to be the saviour of your lives
Gen  For these two years have been years of need and there are still five more years to come in which there will be no ploughing or cutting of grain
Gen  God sent me before you to keep you and yours living on earth so that you might become a great nation
Gen  So now it was not you who sent me here but God and he has made me as a father to Pharaoh and lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of Egypt
Gen  Now go quickly to my father and say to him Your son Joseph says God has made me ruler over all the land of Egypt come down to me straight away
Gen  The land of Goshen will be your livingplace and you will be near me you and your children and your childrens children and your flocks and herds and all you have
Gen  And there I will take care of you so that you and your family may not be in need for there are still five bad years to come
Gen  Now truly your eyes see and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see that it is my mouth which says these things to you
Gen  Give my father word of all my glory in Egypt and of all you have seen and come back quickly with my father
Gen  Then weeping he took Benjamin in his arms and Benjamin himself was weeping on Josephs neck
Gen  Then he gave a kiss to all his brothers weeping over them and after that his brothers had no fear of talking to him
Gen  And news of these things went through Pharaohs house and it was said that Josephs brothers were come and it seemed good to Pharaoh and his servants
Gen  And Pharaoh said to Joseph Say to your brothers Put your goods on your beasts and go back to the land of Canaan
Gen  And get your father and your families and come back to me and I will give you all the good things of Egypt and the fat of the land will be your food
Gen  And say to them This you are to do take carts from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives and get your father and come back
Gen  And take no thought for your goods for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours
Gen  And the children of Israel did as he said and Joseph gave them carts as had been ordered by Pharaoh and food for their journey
Gen  To every one of them he gave three changes of clothing but to Benjamin he gave three hundred bits of silver and five changes of clothing
Gen  And to his father he sent ten asses with good things from Egypt on their backs and ten sheasses with grain and bread and food for his father on the journey
Gen  And he sent his brothers on their way and said to them See that you have no argument on the road
Gen  So they went up from Egypt and came to the land of Canaan to their father Jacob
Gen  And they said to him Joseph is living and is ruler over all the land of Egypt And at this word Jacob was quite overcome for he had no faith in it
Gen  And they gave him an account of everything Joseph had said to them and when he saw the carts which Joseph had sent for them his spirit came back to him
Gen  And Israel said It is enough Joseph my son is still living I will go and see him before my death
Gen  And Israel went on his journey with all he had and came to Beersheba where he made offerings to the God of his father Isaac
Gen  And God said to Israel in a nightvision Jacob Jacob And he said Here am I
Gen  And he said I am God the God of your father go down to Egypt without fear for I will make a great nation of you there
Gen  I will go down with you to Egypt and I will see that you come back again and at your death Joseph will put his hands on your eyes
Gen  Then Jacob went on from Beersheba and the sons of Jacob took their father and their little ones and their wives in the carts which Pharaoh had sent for them
Gen  And they took their cattle and all the goods which they had got in the land of Canaan and came to Egypt even Jacob and all his seed
Gen  His sons and his sons sons his daughters and his daughters sons and all his family he took with him into Egypt
Gen  And these are the names of the children of Israel who came into Egypt even Jacob and all his sons Reuben Jacobs oldest son
Gen  And the sons of Reuben Hanoch and Pallu and Hezron and Carmi
Gen  And the sons of Simeon Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul the son of a woman of Canaan
Gen  And the sons of Levi Gershon Kohath and Merari
Gen  And the sons of Judah Er and Onan and Shelah and Perez and Zerah but Er and Onan had come to their death in the land of Canaan and the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul
Gen  And the sons of Issachar Tola and Puah and Job and Shimron
Gen  And the sons of Zebulun Sered and Elon and Jahleel
Gen  All these together with his daughter Dinah were the children of Leah whom Jacob had by her in Paddanaram they were thirtythree in number
Gen  And the sons of Gad Ziphion and Haggi Shuni and Ezbon Eri and Arodi and Areli
Gen  And the sons of Asher Jimnah and Ishvah and Ishvi and Beriah and Sarah their sister and the sons of Beriah Heber and Malchiel
Gen  These are the children of Zilpah whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah and Jacob had these sixteen children by her
Gen  The sons of Jacobs wife Rachel Joseph and Benjamin
Gen  And Joseph had Manasseh and Ephraim in the land of Egypt by Asenath the daughter of Potiphera priest of On
Gen  And the sons of Benjamin were Belah and Becher and Ashbel Gera and Naaman Ehi and Rosh Muppim and Huppim and Ard
Gen  All these were the children of Rachel whom Jacob had by her fourteen persons
Gen  And the son of Dan was Hushim
Gen  And the sons of Naphtali Jahzeel and Guni and Jezer and Shillem
Gen  These were the children of Bilhah whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel seven persons
Gen  All the persons who came with Jacob into Egypt the offspring of his body were sixtysix without taking into account the wives of Jacobs sons
Gen  And the sons of Joseph whom he had in Egypt were two Seventy persons of the family of Jacob came into Egypt
Gen  Now he had sent Judah before him to Goshen to get word from Joseph and so they came to the land of Goshen
Gen  And Joseph got his carriage ready and went to Goshen for the meeting with his father and when he came before him he put his arms round his neck weeping
Gen  And Israel said to Joseph Now that I have seen you living again I am ready for death
Gen  And Joseph said to his brothers and to his fathers people I will go and give the news to Pharaoh and say to him My brothers and my fathers people from the land of Canaan have come to me
Gen  And these men are keepers of sheep and owners of cattle and have with them their flocks and their herds and all they have
Gen  Now when Pharaoh sends for you and says What is your business
Gen  You are to say Your servants have been keepers of cattle from our early days up to now like our fathers in this way you will be able to have the land of Goshen for yourselves because keepers of sheep are unclean in the eyes of the Egyptians
Gen  Then Joseph went to Pharaoh and said My father and my brothers with their flocks and their herds and all they have are come from Canaan and are now in the land of Goshen
Gen  And he took five of his brothers to Pharaoh
Gen  And Pharaoh said to them What is your business And they said Your servants are keepers of sheep as our fathers were before us
Gen  And they said to Pharaoh We have come to make a living in this land because we have no grass for our flocks in the land of Canaan so now let your servants make a place for themselves in the land of Goshen
Gen  And Pharaoh said to Joseph Let them have the land of Goshen and if there are any able men among them put them over my cattle
Gen  And Jacob and his sons came to Joseph in Egypt and when word of it came to the ears of Pharaoh king of Egypt he said to Joseph Your father and brothers have come to you all the land of Egypt is before you let your father and your brothers have the best of the land for their restingplace
Gen  Then Joseph made his father Jacob come before Pharaoh and Jacob gave him his blessing
Gen  And Pharaoh said to him How old are you
Gen  And Jacob said The years of my wanderings have been a hundred and thirty small in number and full of sorrow have been the years of my life and less than the years of the wanderings of my fathers
Gen  And Jacob gave Pharaoh his blessing and went out from before him
Gen  And Joseph made a place for his father and his brothers and gave them a heritage in the land of Egypt in the best of the land the land of Rameses as Pharaoh had given orders
Gen  And Joseph took care of his father and his brothers and all his fathers people giving them food for the needs of their families
Gen  Now there was no food to be had in all the land so that all Egypt and Canaan were wasted from need of food
Gen  And all the money in Egypt and in the land of Canaan which had been given for grain came into the hands of Joseph and he put it in Pharaohs house
Gen  And when all the money in Egypt and Canaan was gone the Egyptians came to Joseph and said Give us bread would you have us come to destruction before your eyes for we have no more money
Gen  And Joseph said Give me your cattle I will give you grain in exchange for your cattle if your money is all gone
Gen  So they took their cattle to Joseph and he gave them bread in exchange for their horses and flocks and herds and asses so all that year he gave them food in exchange for their cattle
Gen  And when that year was ended they came to him in the second year and said We may not keep it from our lords knowledge that all our money is gone and all the herds of cattle are my lords there is nothing more to give my lord but our bodies and our land
Gen  Are we to come to destruction before your eyes we and our land take us and our land and give us bread and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh and give us seed so that we may have life and the land may not become waste
Gen  So Joseph got all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh for every Egyptian gave up his land in exchange for food because of their great need so all the land became Pharaohs
Gen  And as for the people he made servants of them town by town from one end of Egypt to the other
Gen  Only he did not take the land of the priests for the priests had their food given them by Pharaoh and having what Pharaoh gave them they had no need to give up their land
Gen  Then Joseph said to the people I have made you and your land this day the property of Pharaoh here is seed for you to put in your fields
Gen  And when the grain is cut you are to give a fifth part to Pharaoh and four parts will be yours for seed and food and for your families and your little ones
Gen  And they said to him Truly you have kept us from death may we have grace in your eyes and we will be Pharaohs servants
Gen  Then Joseph made a law which is in force to this day that Pharaoh was to have the fifth part only the land of the priests did not become his
Gen  And so Israel was living among the Egyptians in the land of Goshen and they got property there and became very great in numbers and in wealth
Gen  And Jacob was living in the land of Goshen for seventeen years so the years of his life were a hundred and fortyseven
Gen  And the time of his death came near and he sent for his son Joseph and said to him If now I am dear to you put your hand under my leg and take an oath that you will not put me to rest in Egypt
Gen  But when I go to my fathers you are to take me out of Egypt and put me to rest in their last restingplace And he said I will do so
Gen  And he said Take an oath to me and he took an oath to him and Israel gave worship on the beds head
Gen  Now after these things word came to Joseph that his father was ill and he took with him his sons Manasseh and Ephraim
Gen  And when they said to Jacob Your son Joseph is coming to see you then Israel getting all his strength together had himself lifted up in his bed
Gen  And Jacob said to Joseph God the Ruler of all came to me in a vision at Luz in the land of Canaan and gave me his blessing
Gen  And said to me Truly I will make you fertile and give you increase and will make of you a great family of nations and I will give this land to your seed after you to be their heritage for ever
Gen  And now your two sons who came to birth in Egypt before I came to you here are mine Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine in the same way as Reuben and Simeon are
Gen  And any other offspring which you have after them will be yours and will be named after their brothers in their heritage
Gen  And as for me when I came from Paddan death overtook Rachel on the way when we were still some distance from Ephrath and I put her to rest there on the road to Ephrath which is Bethlehem
Gen  Then Israel looking at Josephs sons said Who are these
Gen  And Joseph said to his father They are my sons whom God has given me in this land And he said Let them come near me and I will give them a blessing
Gen  Now because Israel was old his eyes were no longer clear and he was not able to see So he made them come near to him and he gave them a kiss folding them in his arms
Gen  And Israel said to Joseph I had no hope of seeing your face again but God in his mercy has let me see you and your children
Gen  Then Joseph took them from between his knees and went down on his face to the earth
Gen  Then taking Ephraim with his right hand Joseph put him at Israels left side and with his left hand he put Manasseh at Israels right side placing them near him
Gen  And Israel stretching out his right hand put it on the head of Ephraim the younger and his left hand on the head of Manasseh crossing his hands on purpose for Manasseh was the older
Gen  And he gave Joseph a blessing saying May the God to whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac gave worship the God who has taken care of me all my life till this day
Gen  The angel who has been my saviour from all evil send his blessing on these children and let my name and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac be given to them and let them become a great nation in the earth
Gen  Now when Joseph saw that his father had put his right hand on the head of Ephraim it did not seem right to him and lifting his fathers hand he would have put it on the head of Manasseh
Gen  And Joseph said to his father Not so my father for this is the older put your right hand on his head
Gen  But his father would not saying I am doing it on purpose my son he will certainly become a nation and a great one but his younger brother will be greater than he and his seed will become a great family of nations
Gen  So he gave them his blessing that day saying You will be the sign of blessing in Israel for they will say May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh and he put Ephraim before Manasseh
Gen  Then Israel said to Joseph Now my death is near but God will be with you guiding you back to the land of your fathers
Gen  And I have given you more than your brothers even Shechem as your heritage which I took from the Amorites with my sword and my bow
Gen  And Jacob sent for his sons and said Come together all of you so that I may give you news of your fate in future times
Gen  Come near O sons of Jacob and give ear to the words of Israel your father
Gen  Reuben you are my oldest son the firstfruit of my strength first in pride and first in power
Gen  But because you were uncontrolled the first place will not be yours for you went up to your fathers bed even his bridebed and made it unclean
Gen  Simeon and Levi are brothers deceit and force are their secret designs
Gen  Take no part in their secrets O my soul keep far away O my heart from their meetings for in their wrath they put men to death and for their pleasure even oxen were wounded
Gen  A curse on their passion for it was bitter and on their wrath for it was cruel I will let their heritage in Jacob be broken up driving them from their places in Israel
Gen  To you Judah will your brothers give praise your hand will be on the neck of your haters your fathers sons will go down to the earth before you
Gen  Judah is a young lion like a lion full of meat you have become great my son now he takes his rest like a lion stretched out and like an old lion by whom will his sleep be broken
Gen  The rod of authority will not be taken from Judah and he will not be without a lawgiver till he comes who has the right to it and the peoples will put themselves under his rule
Gen  Knotting his asss cord to the vine and his young ass to the best vine washing his robe in wine and his clothing in the blood of grapes
Gen  His eyes will be dark with wine and his teeth white with milk
Gen  The restingplace of Zebulun will be by the sea and he will be a harbour for ships the edge of his land will be by Zidon
Gen  Issachar is a strong ass stretched out among the flocks
Gen  And he saw that rest was good and the land was pleasing so he let them put weights on his back and became a servant
Gen  Dan will be the judge of his people as one of the tribes of Israel
Gen  May Dan be a snake in the way a horned snake by the road biting the horses foot so that the horseman has a fall
Gen  I have been waiting for your salvation O Lord
Gen  Gad an army will come against him but he will come down on them in their flight
Gen  Ashers bread is fat he gives delicate food for kings
Gen  Naphtali is a roe let loose giving fair young ones
Gen  Joseph is a young ox whose steps are turned to the fountain
Gen  He was troubled by the archers they sent out their arrows against him cruelly wounding him
Gen  But their bows were broken by a strong one and the cords of their arms were cut by the Strength of Jacob by the name of the Stone of Israel
Gen  Even by the God of your father who will be your help and by the Ruler of all who will make you full with blessings from heaven on high blessings of the deep stretched out under the earth blessings of the breasts and of the fertile body
Gen  Blessings of sons old and young to the father blessings of the oldest mountains and the fruit of the eternal hills let them come on the head of Joseph on the crown of him who was separate from his brothers
Gen  Benjamin is a wolf searching for meat in the morning he takes his food and in the evening he makes division of what he has taken
Gen  These are the twelve tribes of Israel and these are the words their father said to them blessing them to every one he gave his blessing
Gen  And he gave orders to them saying Put me to rest with my people and with my fathers in the hollow of the rock in the field of Ephron the Hittite
Gen  In the rock in the field of Machpelah near Mamre in the land of Canaan which Abraham got from Ephron the Hittite to be his restingplace
Gen  There Abraham and Sarah his wife were put to rest and there they put Isaac and Rebekah his wife and there I put Leah to rest
Gen  In the rock in the field which was got for a price from the people of Heth
Gen  And when Jacob had come to the end of these words to his sons stretching himself on his bed he gave up his spirit and went the way of his people
Gen  And Joseph put his head down on his fathers face weeping and kissing him
Gen  And Joseph gave orders to his servants who had the necessary knowledge to make his fathers body ready folding it in linen with spices and they did so
Gen  And the forty days needed for making the body ready went by and there was weeping for him among the Egyptians for seventy days
Gen  And when the days of weeping for him were past Joseph said to the servants of Pharaoh If now you have love for me say these words to Pharaoh
Gen  My father made me take an oath saying When I am dead put me to rest in the place I have made ready for myself in the land of Canaan So now let me go and put my father in his last restingplace and I will come back again
Gen  And Pharaoh said Go up and put your father to rest as you gave your oath to him
Gen  So Joseph went up to put his father in his last restingplace and with him went all the servants of Pharaoh and the chief men of his house and all the chiefs of the land of Egypt
Gen  And all the family of Joseph and his brothers and his fathers people only their little ones and their flocks and herds they did not take with them from the land of Goshen
Gen  And carriages went up with him and horsemen a great army
Gen  And they came to the grainfloor of Atad on the other side of Jordan and there they gave the last honours to Jacob with great and bitter sorrow weeping for their father for seven days
Gen  And when the people of the land the people of Canaan at the grainfloor of Atad saw their grief they said Great is the grief of the Egyptians so the place was named Abelmizraim on the other side of Jordan
Gen  So his sons did as he had given them orders to do
Gen  For they took him into the land of Canaan and put him to rest in the hollow rock in the field of Machpelah which Abraham got with the field for a restingplace from Ephron the Hittite at Mamre
Gen  And when his father had been put to rest Joseph and his brothers and all who had gone with him went back to Egypt
Gen  Now after the death of their father Josephs brothers said to themselves It may be that Josephs heart will be turned against us and he will give us punishment for all the evil which we did to him
Gen  So they sent word to Joseph saying Your father before his death gave us orders saying
Gen  You are to say to Joseph Let the wrongdoing of your brothers be overlooked and the evil they did to you now if it is your pleasure let the sin of the servants of your fathers God have forgiveness And at these words Joseph was overcome with weeping
Gen  Then his brothers went and falling at his feet said Truly we are your servants
Gen  And Joseph said Have no fear am I in the place of God
Gen  As for you it was in your mind to do me evil but God has given a happy outcome the salvation of numbers of people as you see today
Gen  So now have no fear for I will take care of you and your little ones So he gave them comfort with kind words
Gen  Now Joseph and all his fathers family went on living in Egypt and the years of Josephs life were a hundred and ten
Gen  And Joseph saw Ephraims children of the third generation and the children of Machir the son of Manasseh came to birth on Josephs knees
Gen  Then Joseph said to his brothers The time of my death has come but God will keep you in mind and take you out of this land into the land which he gave by his oath to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob
Gen  Then Joseph made the children of Israel take an oath saying God will certainly give effect to his word and you are to take my bones away from here
Gen  So Joseph came to his death being a hundred and ten years old and they made his body ready and he was put in a chest in Egypt
Exo  Now these are the names of the sons of Israel who came into Egypt every man and his family came with Jacob
Exo  Reuben Simeon Levi and Judah
Exo  Issachar Zebulun and Benjamin
Exo  Dan and Naphtali Gad and Asher
Exo  All the offspring of Jacob were seventy persons and Joseph had come to Egypt before them
Exo  Then Joseph came to his end and all his brothers and all that generation
Exo  And the children of Israel were fertile increasing very greatly in numbers and in power and the land was full of them
Exo  Now a new king came to power in Egypt who had no knowledge of Joseph
Exo  And he said to his people See the people of Israel are greater in number and in power than we are
Exo  Let us take care for fear that their numbers may become even greater and if there is a war they may be joined with those who are against us and make an attack on us and go up out of the land
Exo  So they put overseers of forced work over them in order to make their strength less by the weight of their work And they made storetowns for Pharaoh Pithom and Raamses
Exo  But the more cruel they were to them the more their number increased till all the land was full of them And the children of Israel were hated by the Egyptians
Exo  And they gave the children of Israel even harder work to do
Exo  And made their lives bitter with hard work making buildingmaterial and bricks and doing all sorts of work in the fields under the hardest conditions
Exo  And the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew women who gave help at the time of childbirth the name of the one was Shiphrah and the name of the other Puah
Exo  When you are looking after the Hebrew women in childbirth if it is a son you are to put him to death but if it is a daughter she may go on living
Exo  But the women had the fear of God and did not do as the king of Egypt said but let the male children go on living
Exo  And the king of Egypt sent for the women and said to them Why have you done this and let the male children go on living
Exo  And they said to Pharaoh Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women for they are strong and the birth takes place before we come to them
Exo  And the blessing of God was on these women and the people were increased in number and became very strong
Exo  And because the women who took care of the Hebrew mothers had the fear of God he gave them families
Exo  And Pharaoh gave orders to all his people saying Every son who comes to birth is to be put into the river but every daughter may go on living
Exo  Now a man of the house of Levi took as his wife a daughter of Levi
Exo  And she became with child and gave birth to a Son and when she saw that he was a beautiful child she kept him secretly for three months
Exo  And when she was no longer able to keep him secret she made him a basket out of the stems of waterplants pasting sticky earth over it to keep the water out and placing the baby in it she put it among the plants by the edge of the Nile
Exo  And his sister took her place at a distance to see what would become of him
Exo  Now Pharaohs daughter came down to the Nile to take a bath while her women were walking by the riverside and she saw the basket among the riverplants and sent her servantgirl to get it
Exo  And opening it she saw the child and he was crying And she had pity on him and said This is one of the Hebrews children
Exo  Then his sister said to Pharaohs daughter May I go and get you one of the Hebrew women to give him the breast
Exo  And Pharaohs daughter said to her Go And the girl went and got the childs mother
Exo  And Pharaohs daughter said to her Take the child away and give it milk for me and I will give you payment And the woman took the child and gave it milk at her breast
Exo  And when the child was older she took him to Pharaohs daughter and he became her son and she gave him the name Moses Because she said I took him out of the water
Exo  Now when Moses had become a man one day he went out to his people and saw how hard their work was and he saw an Egyptian giving blows to a Hebrew one of his people
Exo  And turning this way and that and seeing no one he put the Egyptian to death covering his body with sand
Exo  And he went out the day after and saw two of the Hebrews fighting and he said to him who was in the wrong Why are you fighting your brother
Exo  And he said Who made you a ruler and a judge over us are you going to put me to death as you did the Egyptian And Moses was in fear and said It is clear that the thing has come to light
Exo  Now when Pharaoh had news of this he would have put Moses to death But Moses went in flight from Pharaoh into the land of Midian and he took his seat by a waterspring
Exo  Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters and they came to get water for their fathers flock
Exo  And the keepers of the sheep came up and were driving them away but Moses got up and came to their help watering their flock for them
Exo  And when they came to Reuel their father he said How is it that you have come back so quickly today
Exo  And they said An Egyptian came to our help against the keepers of sheep and got water for us and gave it to the flock
Exo  And he said to his daughters Where is he why have you let the man go make him come in and give him a meal
Exo  And Moses was happy to go on living with the man and he gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses
Exo  And she gave birth to a son to whom he gave the name Gershom for he said I have been living in a strange land
Exo  Now after a long time the king of Egypt came to his end and the children of Israel were crying in their grief under the weight of their work and their cry for help came to the ears of God
Exo  And at the sound of their weeping the agreement which God had made with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob came to his mind
Exo  And Gods eyes were turned to the children of Israel and he gave them the knowledge of himself
Exo  Now Moses was looking after the flock of Jethro his fatherinlaw the priest of Midian and he took the flock to the back of the waste land and came to Horeb the mountain of God
Exo  And the angel of the Lord was seen by him in a flame of fire coming out of a thorntree and he saw that the tree was on fire but it was not burned up
Exo  And Moses said I will go and see this strange thing why the tree is not burned up
Exo  And when the Lord saw him turning to one side to see God said his name out of the tree crying Moses Moses And he said Here am I
Exo  And he said Do not come near take off your shoes from your feet for the place where you are is holy
Exo  And he said I am the God of your fathers the God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob And Moses kept his face covered for fear of looking on God
Exo  And God said Truly I have seen the grief of my people in Egypt and their cry because of their cruel masters has come to my ears for I have knowledge of their sorrows
Exo  And I have come down to take them out of the hands of the Egyptians guiding them out of that land into a good land and wide into a land flowing with milk and honey into the place of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite
Exo  For now truly the cry of the children of Israel has come to me and I have seen the cruel behaviour of the Egyptians to them
Exo  Come then and I will send you to Pharaoh so that you may take my people the children of Israel out of Egypt
Exo  And Moses said to God Who am I to go to Pharaoh and take the children of Israel out of Egypt
Exo  And he said Truly I will be with you and this will be the sign to you that I have sent you when you have taken the children of Israel out of Egypt you will give worship to God on this mountain
Exo  And Moses said to God When I come to the children of Israel and say to them The God of your fathers has sent me to you and they say to me What is his name what am I to say to them
Exo  And God said to him I AM WHAT I AM and he said Say to the children of Israel I AM has sent me to you
Exo  And God went on to say to Moses Say to the children of Israel The Lord the God of your fathers the God of Abraham of Isaac and of Jacob has sent me to you this is my name for ever and this is my sign to all generations
Exo  Go and get together the chiefs of the children of Israel and say to them The Lord the God of your fathers the God of Abraham of Isaac and of Jacob has been seen by me and has said Truly I have taken up your cause because of what is done to you in Egypt
Exo  And I have said I will take you up out of the sorrows of Egypt into the land of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite into a land flowing with milk and honey
Exo  And they will give ear to your voice and you with the chiefs of Israel will go to Pharaoh the king of Egypt and say to him The Lord the God of the Hebrews has come to us let us then go three days journey into the waste land to make an offering to the Lord our God
Exo  And I am certain that the king of Egypt will not let you go without being forced
Exo  But I will put out my hand and overcome Egypt with all the wonders which I will do among them and after that he will let you go
Exo  And I will give this people grace in the eyes of the Egyptians so that when you go out you will go out with your hands full
Exo  For every woman will get from her neighbour and from the woman living in her house ornaments of silver and gold and clothing and you will put them on your sons and your daughters you will take the best of their goods from the Egyptians
Exo  And Moses answering said It is certain that they will not have faith in me or give ear to my voice for they will say You have not seen the Lord
Exo  And the Lord said to him What is that in your hand And he said A rod
Exo  And he said Put it down on the earth And he put it down on the earth and it became a snake and Moses went running from it
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses Put out your hand and take it by the tail and he put out his hand and took a grip of it and it became a rod in his hand
Exo  So that they may be certain that the Lord the God of their fathers the God of Abraham of Isaac and of Jacob has been seen by you
Exo  Then the Lord said to him again Put your hand inside your clothing And he put his hand inside his robe and when he took it out it was like the hand of a leper as white as snow
Exo  And he said Put your hand inside your robe again And he put his hand into his robe again and when he took it out he saw that it had become like his other flesh
Exo  And if they do not have faith in you or give ear to the voice of the first sign they will have faith in the second sign
Exo  And if they have no faith even in these two signs and will not give ear to your voice then you are to take the water of the Nile and put it on the dry land and the water you take out of the river will become blood on the dry land
Exo  And Moses said to the Lord O Lord I am not a man of words I have never been so and am not now even after what you have said to your servant for talking is hard for me and I am slow of tongue
Exo  And the Lord said to him Who has made mans mouth who takes away a mans voice or hearing or makes him seeing or blind Is it not I the Lord
Exo  So go now and I will be with your mouth teaching you what to say
Exo  And he said O Lord send if you will by the hand of anyone whom it seems good to you to send
Exo  And the Lord was angry with Moses and said Is there not Aaron your brother the Levite To my knowledge he is good at talking And now he is coming out to you and when he sees you he will be glad in his heart
Exo  Let him give ear to your voice and you will put my words in his mouth and I will be with your mouth and with his teaching you what you have to do
Exo  And he will do the talking for you to the people he will be to you as a mouth and you will be to him as God
Exo  And take in your hand this rod with which you will do the signs
Exo  And Moses went back to Jethro his fatherinlaw and said to him Let me go back now to my relations in Egypt and see if they are still living And Jethro said to Moses Go in peace
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses in Midian Go back to Egypt for all the men are dead who were attempting to take your life
Exo  And Moses took his wife and his sons and put them on an ass and went back to the land of Egypt and he took the rod of God in his hand
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses When you go back to Egypt see that you do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have given you power to do but I will make his heart hard and he will not let the people go
Exo  And you are to say to Pharaoh The Lord says Israel is the first of my sons
Exo  And I said to you Let my son go so that he may give me worship and you did not let him go so now I will put the first of your sons to death
Exo  Now on the journey at the nights restingplace the Lord came in his way and would have put him to death
Exo  Then Zipporah took a sharp stone and cutting off the skin of her sons private parts and touching his feet with it she said Truly you are a husband of blood to me
Exo  So he let him go Then she said You are a husband of blood because of the circumcision
Exo  And the Lord said to Aaron Go into the waste land and you will see Moses So he went and came across Moses at the mountain of God and gave him a kiss
Exo  And Moses gave Aaron an account of all the words of the Lord which he had sent him to say and of all the signs which he had given him orders to do
Exo  Then Moses and Aaron went and got together all the chiefs of the children of Israel
Exo  And Aaron said to them all the words the Lord had said to Moses and did the signs before all the people
Exo  And the people had faith in them and hearing that the Lord had taken up the cause of the children of Israel and had seen their troubles with bent heads they gave him worship
Exo  And after that Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh and said The Lord the God of Israel says Let my people go so that they may keep a feast to me in the waste land
Exo  And Pharaoh said Who is the Lord to whose voice I am to give ear and let Israel go I have no knowledge of the Lord and I will not let Israel go
Exo  And they said The God of the Hebrews has come to us let us then go three days journey into the waste land to make an offering to the Lord our God so that he may not send death on us by disease or the sword
Exo  And the king of Egypt said to them Why do you Moses and Aaron take the people away from their work get back to your work
Exo  And Pharaoh said Truly the people of the land are increasing in number and you are keeping them back from their work
Exo  The same day Pharaoh gave orders to the overseers and those who were responsible for the work saying
Exo  Give these men no more dry stems for their brickmaking as you have been doing let them go and get the material for themselves
Exo  But see that they make the same number of bricks as before and no less for they have no love for work and so they are crying out and saying Let us go and make an offering to our God
Exo  Give the men harder work and see that they do it let them not give attention to false words
Exo  And the overseers of the people and their responsible men went out and said to the people Pharaoh says I will give you no more dry stems
Exo  Go yourselves and get dry stems wherever you are able for your work is not to be any less
Exo  So the people were sent in all directions through the land of Egypt to get dry grass for stems
Exo  And the overseers went on driving them and saying Do your full days work as before when there were dry stems for you
Exo  And the responsible men of the children of Israel whom Pharaohs overseers had put over them were given blows and they said to them Why have you not done your regular work in making bricks as before
Exo  Then the responsible men of the children of Israel came to Pharaoh protesting and saying Why are you acting in this way to your servants
Exo  They give us no dry stems and they say to us Make bricks and they give your servants blows but it is your people who are in the wrong
Exo  But he said You have no love for work that is why you say Let us go and make an offering to the Lord
Exo  Go now get back to your work no dry stems will be given to you but you are to make the full number of bricks
Exo  Then the responsible men of the children of Israel saw that they were purposing evil when they said The number of bricks which you have to make every day will be no less than before
Exo  And they came face to face with Moses and Aaron who were in their way when they came out from Pharaoh
Exo  And they said to them May the Lord take note of you and be your judge for you have given Pharaoh and his servants a bad opinion of us putting a sword in their hands for our destruction
Exo  And Moses went back to the Lord and said Lord why have you done evil to this people why have you sent me
Exo  For from the time when I came to Pharaoh to put your words before him he has done evil to this people and you have given them no help
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses Now you will see what I am about to do to Pharaoh for by a strong hand he will be forced to let them go driving them out of his land because of my outstretched arm
Exo  And God said to Moses I am Yahweh
Exo  I let myself be seen by Abraham Isaac and Jacob as God the Ruler of all but they had no knowledge of my name Yahweh
Exo  And I made an agreement with them to give them the land of Canaan the land of their wanderings
Exo  And truly my ears are open to the cry of the children of Israel whom the Egyptians keep under their yoke and I have kept in mind my agreement
Exo  Say then to the children of Israel I am Yahweh and I will take you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians and make you safe from their power and will make you free by the strength of my arm after great punishments
Exo  And I will take you to be my people and I will be your God and you will be certain that I am the Lord your God who takes you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians
Exo  And I will be your guide into the land which I made an oath to give to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob and I will give it to you for your heritage I am Yahweh
Exo  And Moses said these words to the children of Israel but they gave no attention to him because of the grief of their spirit and the cruel weight of their work
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses
Exo  Go in and say to Pharaoh king of Egypt that he is to let the children of Israel go out of his land
Exo  And Moses answering the Lord said See the children of Israel will not give ear to me how then will Pharaoh give ear to me whose lips are unclean
Exo  And the word of the Lord came to Moses and Aaron with orders for the children of Israel and for Pharaoh king of Egypt to take the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt
Exo  These are the heads of their fathers families the sons of Reuben the oldest son of Israel Hanoch and Pallu Hezron and Carmi these are the families of Reuben
Exo  And the sons of Simeon Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul the son of a woman of Canaan these are the families of Simeon
Exo  And these are the names of the sons of Levi in the order of their generations Gershon and Kohath and Merari and the years of Levis life were a hundred and thirtyseven
Exo  The sons of Gershon Libni and Shimei in the order of their families
Exo  And the sons of Kohath Amram and Izhar and Hebron and Uzziel and the years of Kohaths life were a hundred and thirtythree
Exo  And the sons of Merari Mahli and Mushi these are the families of the Levites in the order of their generations
Exo  And Amram took Jochebed his fathers sister as wife and she gave birth to Aaron and Moses and the years of Amrams life were a hundred and thirtyseven
Exo  And the sons of Izhar Korah and Nepheg and Zichri
Exo  And the sons of Uzziel Mishael and Elzaphan and Sithri
Exo  And Aaron took as his wife Elisheba the daughter of Amminadab the sister of Nahshon and she gave birth to Nadab and Abihu Eleazar and Ithamar
Exo  And the sons of Korah Assir and Elkanah and Abiasaph these are the families of the Korahites
Exo  And Eleazar Aarons son took as his wife one of the daughters of Putiel and she gave birth to Phinehas These are the heads of the families of the Levites in the order of their families
Exo  These are the same Aaron and Moses to whom the Lord said Take the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt in their armies
Exo  These are the men who gave orders to Pharaoh to let the children of Israel go out of Egypt these are the same Moses and Aaron
Exo  And on the day when the word of the Lord came to Moses in the land of Egypt
Exo  The Lord said to Moses I am the Lord say to Pharaoh king of Egypt everything I am saying to you
Exo  And Moses said to the Lord My lips are unclean how is it possible that Pharaoh will give me a hearing
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses See I have made you a god to Pharaoh and Aaron your brother will be your prophet
Exo  Say whatever I give you orders to say and Aaron your brother will give word to Pharaoh to let the children of Israel go out of his land
Exo  And I will make Pharaohs heart hard and my signs and wonders will be increased in the land of Egypt
Exo  But Pharaoh will not give ear to you and I will put my hand on Egypt and take my armies my people the children of Israel out of Egypt after great punishments
Exo  And the Egyptians will see that I am the Lord when my hand is stretched out over Egypt and I take the children of Israel out from among them
Exo  And Moses and Aaron did so as the Lord gave them orders so they did
Exo  And Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eightythree years old when they gave the Lords word to Pharaoh
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron
Exo  If Pharaoh says to you Let me see a wonder then say to Aaron Take your rod and put it down on the earth before Pharaoh so that it may become a snake
Exo  Then Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh and they did as the Lord had said and Aaron put his rod down on the earth before Pharaoh and his servants and it became a snake
Exo  Then Pharaoh sent for the wise men and the wonderworkers and they the wonderworkers of Egypt did the same with their secret arts
Exo  For every one of them put down his rod on the earth and they became snakes but Aarons rod made a meal of their rods
Exo  But Pharaohs heart was made hard and he did not give ear to them as the Lord had said
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron Pharaohs heart is unchanged he will not let the people go
Exo  Go to Pharaoh in the morning when he goes out to the water you will be waiting for him by the edge of the Nile with the rod which was turned into a snake in your hand
Exo  And say to him The Lord the God of the Hebrews has sent me to you saying Let my people go so that they may give me worship in the waste land but up to now you have not given ear to his words
Exo  So the Lord says By this you may be certain that I am the Lord see by the touch of this rod in my hand the waters of the Nile will be turned to blood
Exo  And the fish in the Nile will come to destruction and the river will send up a bad smell and the Egyptians will not be able for disgust to make use of the water of the Nile for drinking
Exo  And the Lord said Say to Aaron Let the rod in your hand be stretched out over the waters of Egypt and over the rivers and the streams and the pools and over every stretch of water so that they may be turned to blood and there will be blood through all the land of Egypt in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone
Exo  And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord had said and when his rod had been lifted up and stretched out over the waters of the Nile before the eyes of Pharaoh and his servants all the water in the Nile was turned to blood
Exo  And the fish in the Nile came to destruction and a bad smell went up from the river and the Egyptians were not able to make use of the water of the Nile for drinking and there was blood through all the land of Egypt
Exo  And the wonderworkers of Egypt did the same with their secret arts but Pharaohs heart was made hard and he would not give ear to them as the Lord had said
Exo  Then Pharaoh went into his house and did not take even this to heart
Exo  And all the Egyptians made holes round about the Nile to get drinkingwater for they were not able to make use of the Nile water
Exo  And seven days went past after the Lord had put his hand on the Nile
Exo  And this is what the Lord said to Moses Go to Pharaoh and say to him The Lord says Let my people go so that they may give me worship
Exo  And if you will not let them go see I will send frogs into every part of your land
Exo  The Nile will be full of frogs and they will come up into your house and into your bedrooms and on your bed and into the houses of your servants and your people and into your ovens and into your breadbasins
Exo  The frogs will come up over you and your people and all your servants
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses Say to Aaron Let the rod in your hand be stretched out over the streams and the waterways and the pools causing frogs to come up on the land of Egypt
Exo  And when Aaron put out his hand over the waters of Egypt the frogs came up and all the land of Egypt was covered with them
Exo  And the wonderworkers did the same with their secret arts making frogs come up over the land of Egypt
Exo  Then Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron and said Make prayer to the Lord that he will take away these frogs from me and my people and I will let the people go and make their offering to the Lord
Exo  And Moses said I will let you have the honour of saying when I am to make prayer for you and your servants and your people that the frogs may be sent away from you and your houses and be only in the Nile
Exo  And he said By tomorrow And he said Let it be as you say so that you may see that there is no other like the Lord our God
Exo  And the frogs will be gone from you and from your houses and from your servants and from your people and will be only in the Nile
Exo  Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh and Moses made prayer to the Lord about the frogs which he had sent on Pharaoh
Exo  And the Lord did as Moses said and there was an end of all the frogs in the houses and in the open spaces and in the fields
Exo  And they put them together in masses and a bad smell went up from the land
Exo  But when Pharaoh saw that there was peace for a time he made his heart hard and did not give ear to them as the Lord had said
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses Say to Aaron Let your rod be stretched out over the dust of the earth so that it may become insects through all the land of Egypt
Exo  And they did so and Aaron stretching out the rod in his hand gave a touch to the dust of the earth and insects came on man and on beast all the dust of the earth was changed into insects through all the land of Egypt
Exo  And the wonderworkers with their secret arts attempting to make insects were unable to do so and there were insects on man and on beast
Exo  Then the wonderworkers said to Pharaoh This is the finger of God but Pharaohs heart was hard and he did not give ear to them as the Lord had said
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses Get up early in the morning and take your place before Pharaoh when he comes out to the water and say to him This is what the Lord says Let my people go to give me worship
Exo  For if you do not let my people go see I will send clouds of flies on you and on your servants and on your people and into their houses and the houses of the Egyptians and the land where they are will be full of flies
Exo  And at that time I will make a division between your land and the land of Goshen where my people are and no flies will be there so that you may see that I am the Lord over all the earth
Exo  And I will put a division between my people and your people tomorrow this sign will be seen
Exo  And the Lord did so and great clouds of flies came into the house of Pharaoh and into his servants houses and all the land of Egypt was made waste because of the flies
Exo  And Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron and said Go and make your offering to your God here in the land
Exo  And Moses said It is not right to do so for we make our offerings of that to which the Egyptians give worship and if we do so before their eyes certainly we will be stoned
Exo  But we will go three days journey into the waste land and make an offering to the Lord our God as he may give us orders
Exo  Then Pharaoh said I will let you go to make an offering to the Lord your God in the waste land but do not go very far away and make prayer for me
Exo  And Moses said When I go out from you I will make prayer to the Lord that the cloud of flies may go away from Pharaoh and from his people and from his servants tomorrow only let Pharaoh no longer by deceit keep back the people from making their offering to the Lord
Exo  Then Moses went out from Pharaoh and made prayer to the Lord
Exo  And the Lord did as Moses said and took away the cloud of flies from Pharaoh and from his servants and from his people not one was to be seen
Exo  But again Pharaoh made his heart hard and did not let the people go
Exo  Then the Lord said to Moses Go in to Pharaoh and say to him This is what the Lord the God of the Hebrews says Let my people go so that they may give me worship
Exo  For if you will not let them go but still keep them in your power
Exo  Then the hand of the Lord will put on your cattle in the field on the horses and the asses and the camels on the herds and the flocks a very evil disease
Exo  And the Lord will make a division between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt there will be no loss of any of the cattle of Israel
Exo  And the time was fixed by the Lord and he said Tomorrow the Lord will do this thing in the land
Exo  And on the day after the Lord did as he had said causing the death of all the cattle of Egypt but there was no loss of any of the cattle of Israel
Exo  And Pharaoh sent and got word that there was no loss of any of the cattle of Israel But the heart of Pharaoh was hard and he did not let the people go
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses and to Aaron Take in your hand a little dust from the fire and let Moses send it in a shower up to heaven before the eyes of Pharaoh
Exo  And it will become small dust over all the land of Egypt and will be a skindisease bursting out in wounds on man and beast through all the land of Egypt
Exo  So they took some dust from the fire and placing themselves before Pharaoh Moses sent it out in a shower up to heaven and it became a skindisease bursting out on man and on beast
Exo  And the wonderworkers were not able to take their places before Moses because of the disease for the disease was on the wonderworkers and on all the Egyptians
Exo  And the Lord made Pharaohs heart hard and he would not give ear to them as the Lord had said
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses Get up early in the morning and take your place before Pharaoh and say to him This is what the Lord the God of the Hebrews says Let my people go so that they may give me worship
Exo  For this time I will send all my punishments on yourself and on your servants and on your people so that you may see that there is no other like me in all the earth
Exo  For if I had put the full weight of my hand on you and your people you would have been cut off from the earth
Exo  But for this very reason I have kept you from destruction to make clear to you my power and so that my name may be honoured through all the earth
Exo  Are you still uplifted in pride against my people so that you will not let them go
Exo  Truly tomorrow about this time I will send down an icestorm such as never was in Egypt from its earliest days till now
Exo  Then send quickly and get in your cattle and all you have from the fields for if any man or beast in the field has not been put under cover the icestorm will come down on them with destruction
Exo  Then everyone among the servants of Pharaoh who had the fear of the Lord made his servants and his cattle come quickly into the house
Exo  And he who gave no attention to the word of the Lord kept his servants and his cattle in the field
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses Now let your hand be stretched out to heaven so that there may be an icestorm on all the land of Egypt on man and on beast and on every plant of the field through all the land of Egypt
Exo  And Moses put out his rod to heaven and the Lord sent thunder and an icestorm and fire running down on the earth the Lord sent an icestorm on the land of Egypt
Exo  So there was an icestorm with fire running through it coming down with great force such as never was in all the land of Egypt from the time when it became a nation
Exo  And through all the land of Egypt the icestorm came down on everything which was in the fields on man and on beast and every green plant was crushed and every tree of the field broken
Exo  Only in the land of Goshen where the children of Israel were there was no icestorm
Exo  Then Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron and said to them I have done evil this time the Lord is upright and I and my people are sinners
Exo  Make prayer to the Lord for there has been enough of these thunderings of God and this icestorm and I will let you go and will keep you no longer
Exo  And Moses said When I am gone outside the town my hands will be stretched out to the Lord the thunders and the icestorm will come to an end so that you may see that the earth is the Lords
Exo  But as for you and your servants I am certain that even now the fear of the Lord God will not be in your hearts
Exo  And the flax and the barley were damaged for the barley was almost ready to be cut and the flax was in flower
Exo  But the rest of the grainplants were undamaged for they had not come up
Exo  So Moses went out of the town and stretching out his hands made prayer to God and the thunders and the icestorm came to an end and the fall of rain was stopped
Exo  But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the icestorm and the thunders were ended he went on sinning and made his heart hard he and his servants
Exo  And the heart of Pharaoh was hard and he did not let the people go as the Lord had said by the mouth of Moses
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses Go in to Pharaoh for I have made his heart and the hearts of his servants hard so that I may let my signs be seen among them
Exo  And so that you may be able to give to your son and to your sons son the story of my wonders in Egypt and the signs which I have done among them so that you may see that I am the Lord
Exo  Then Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh and said to him This is what the Lord the God of the Hebrews says How long will you be lifted up in your pride before me let my people go so that they may give me worship
Exo  For if you will not let my people go tomorrow I will send locusts into your land
Exo  And the face of the earth will be covered with them so that you will not be able to see the earth and they will be the destruction of everything which up to now has not been damaged everything which was not crushed by the icestorm and every tree still living in your fields
Exo  And your houses will be full of them and the houses of your servants and of all the Egyptians it will be worse than anything your fathers have seen or their fathers from the day when they were living on the earth till this day And so he went out from Pharaoh
Exo  And Pharaohs servants said to him How long is this man to be the cause of evil to us let the men go so that they may give worship to the Lord their God are you not awake to Egypts danger
Exo  Then Moses and Aaron came in again before Pharaoh and he said to them Go and give worship to the Lord your God but which of you are going
Exo  And Moses said We will go with our young and our old with our sons and our daughters with our flocks and our herds for we are to keep a feast to the Lord
Exo  And he said to them May the Lord be with you if I will let you and your little ones go take care for your purpose clearly is evil
Exo  Not so but let your males go and give worship to the Lord as your desire is This he said driving them out from before him
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses Let your hand be stretched out over the land of Egypt so that the locusts may come up on the land for the destruction of every green plant in the land even everything untouched by the icestorm
Exo  And Moses rod was stretched out over the land of Egypt and the Lord sent an east wind over the land all that day and all the night and in the morning the locusts came up with the east wind
Exo  And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt resting on every part of the land in very great numbers such an army of locusts had never been seen before and never will be again
Exo  For all the face of the earth was covered with them so that the land was black and every green plant and all the fruit of the trees which was untouched by the icestorm they took for food not one green thing no plant or tree was to be seen in all the land of Egypt
Exo  Then Pharaoh quickly sent for Moses and Aaron and said I have done evil against the Lord your God and against you
Exo  Let me now have forgiveness for my sin this time only and make prayer to the Lord your God that he will take away from me this death only
Exo  So he went out from Pharaoh and made prayer to the Lord
Exo  And the Lord sent a very strong west wind which took up the locusts driving them into the Red Sea not one locust was to be seen in any part of Egypt
Exo  But the Lord made Pharaohs heart hard and he did not let the children of Israel go
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses Let your hand be stretched out to heaven and all the land of Egypt will be dark so that men will be feeling their way about in the dark
Exo  And when Moses hand was stretched out dark night came over all the land of Egypt for three days
Exo  They were not able to see one another and no one got up from his place for three days but where the children of Israel were living it was light
Exo  Then Pharaoh sent for Moses and said Go and give worship to the Lord only let your flocks and your herds be kept here your little ones may go with you
Exo  But Moses said You will have to let us take burned offerings to put before the Lord our God
Exo  So our cattle will have to go with us not one may be kept back for they are needed for the worship of the Lord our God we have no knowledge what offering we have to give till we come to the place
Exo  But the Lord made Pharaohs heart hard and he would not let them go
Exo  And Pharaoh said to him Go away from me take care that you come not again before me for the day when you see my face again will be your last
Exo  And Moses said You say truly I will not see your face again
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses I will send one more punishment on Pharaoh and on Egypt after that he will let you go and when he does let you go he will not keep one of you back but will send you out by force
Exo  So go now and give orders to the people that every man and every woman is to get from his or her neighbour ornaments of silver and of gold
Exo  And the Lord gave the people grace in the eyes of the Egyptians For the man Moses was highly honoured in the land of Egypt by Pharaohs servants and the people
Exo  And Moses said This is what the Lord says About the middle of the night I will go out through Egypt
Exo  And death will come to every mothers first male child in all the land of Egypt from the child of Pharaoh on his seat of power to the child of the servantgirl crushing the grain and the first births of all the cattle
Exo  And there will be a great cry through all the land of Egypt such as never has been or will be again
Exo  But against the children of Israel man or beast not so much as the tongue of a dog will be moved so that you may see how the Lord makes a division between Israel and the Egyptians
Exo  And all these your servants will come to me going down on their faces before me and saying Go out and all your people with you and after that I will go out And he went away from Pharaoh burning with wrath
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses Pharaoh will not give ear to you so that my wonders may be increased in the land of Egypt
Exo  All these wonders Moses and Aaron did before Pharaoh but the Lord made Pharaohs heart hard and he did not let the children of Israel go out of his land
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt
Exo  Let this month be to you the first of months the first month of the year
Exo  Say to all the children of Israel when they are come together In the tenth day of this month every man is to take a lamb by the number of their fathers families a lamb for every family
Exo  And if the lamb is more than enough for the family let that family and its nearest neighbour have a lamb between them taking into account the number of persons and how much food is needed for every man
Exo  Let your lamb be without a mark a male in its first year you may take it from among the sheep or the goats
Exo  Keep it till the fourteenth day of the same month when everyone who is of the children of Israel is to put it to death between sundown and dark
Exo  Then take some of the blood and put it on the two sides of the door and over the door of the house where the meal is to be taken
Exo  And let your food that night be the flesh of the lamb cooked with fire in the oven together with unleavened bread and bittertasting plants
Exo  Do not take it uncooked or cooked with boiling water but let it be cooked in the oven its head with its legs and its inside parts
Exo  Do not keep any of it till the morning anything which is not used is to be burned with fire
Exo  And take your meal dressed as if for a journey with your shoes on your feet and your sticks in your hands take it quickly it is the Lords Passover
Exo  For on that night I will go through the land of Egypt sending death on every first male child of man and of beast and judging all the gods of Egypt I am the Lord
Exo  And the blood will be a sign on the houses where you are when I see the blood I will go over you and no evil will come on you for your destruction when my hand is on the land of Egypt
Exo  And this day is to be kept in your memories you are to keep it as a feast to the Lord through all your generations as an order for ever
Exo  For seven days let your food be unleavened bread from the first day no leaven is to be seen in your houses whoever takes bread with leaven in it from the first till the seventh day will be cut off from Israel
Exo  And on the first day there is to be a holy meeting and on the seventh day a holy meeting no sort of work may be done on those days but only to make ready what is necessary for everyones food
Exo  So keep the feast of unleavened bread for on this very day I have taken your armies out of the land of Egypt this day then is to be kept through all your generations by an order for ever
Exo  In the first month from the evening of the fourteenth day let your food be unleavened bread till the evening of the twentyfirst day of the month
Exo  For seven days no leaven is to be seen in your houses for whoever takes bread which is leavened will be cut off from the people of Israel if he is from another country or if he is an Israelite by birth
Exo  Take nothing which has leaven in it wherever you are living let your food be unleavened cakes
Exo  Then Moses sent for the chiefs of Israel and said to them See that lambs are marked out for yourselves and your families and let the Passover lamb be put to death
Exo  And take some hyssop and put it in the blood in the basin touching the two sides and the top of the doorway with the blood from the basin and let not one of you go out of his house till the morning
Exo  For the Lord will go through the land sending death on the Egyptians and when he sees the blood on the two sides and the top of the door the Lord will go over your door and will not let death come in for your destruction
Exo  And you are to keep this as an order to you and to your sons for ever
Exo  And when you come into the land which the Lord will make yours as he gave his word you are to keep this act of worship
Exo  And when your children say to you What is the reason of this act of worship
Exo  Then you will say This is the offering of the Lords Passover for he went over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt when he sent death on the Egyptians and kept our families safe And the people gave worship with bent heads
Exo  And the children of Israel went and did so as the Lord had given orders to Moses and Aaron so they did
Exo  And in the middle of the night the Lord sent death on every first male child in the land of Egypt from the child of Pharaoh on his seat of power to the child of the prisoner in the prison and the first births of all the cattle
Exo  Then Pharaoh got up in the night he and all his servants and all the Egyptians and a great cry went up from Egypt for there was not a house where someone was not dead
Exo  And he sent for Moses and Aaron by night and said Get up and go out from among my people you and the children of Israel go and give worship to the Lord as you have said
Exo  And take your flocks and your herds as you have said and be gone and give me your blessing
Exo  And the Egyptians were forcing the people on to get them out of the land quickly for they said We are all dead men
Exo  And the people took their breadpaste before it was leavened putting their basins in their clothing on their backs
Exo  And the children of Israel had done as Moses had said and they got from the Egyptians ornaments of silver and of gold and clothing
Exo  And the Lord had given the people grace in the eyes of the Egyptians so that they gave them whatever was requested So they took away all their goods from the Egyptians
Exo  And the children of Israel made the journey from Rameses to Succoth there were about six hundred thousand men on foot as well as children
Exo  And a mixed band of people went with them and flocks and herds in great numbers
Exo  And they made unleavened cakes from the paste which they had taken out of Egypt it was not leavened for they had been sent out of Egypt so quickly that they had no time to make any food ready
Exo  Now the children of Israel had been living in Egypt for four hundred and thirty years
Exo  And at the end of four hundred and thirty years to the very day all the armies of the Lord went out of the land of Egypt
Exo  It is a watchnight before the Lord who took them out of the land of Egypt this same night is a watchnight to the Lord for all the children of Israel through all their generations
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron This is the law of the Passover no man who is not an Israelite is to take of it
Exo  But every mans servant whom he has got for money may take of it when he has had circumcision
Exo  A man from a strange country living among you and a servant working for payment may not take part in it
Exo  It is to be taken in one house not a bit of the flesh is to be taken out of the house and no bone of it may be broken
Exo  All Israel is to keep the feast
Exo  And if a man from another country is living with you and has a desire to keep the Passover to the Lord let all the males of his family undergo circumcision and then let him come near and keep it for he will then be as one of your people but no one without circumcision may keep it
Exo  The law is the same for him who is an Israelite by birth and for the man from a strange country who is living with you
Exo  So the children of Israel did as the Lord gave orders to Moses and Aaron
Exo  And on that very day the Lord took the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses
Exo  Let the first male child of every mother among the children of Israel be kept holy for me even the first male birth among man or beast for it is mine
Exo  And Moses said to the people Let this day on which you came out of Egypt out of your prisonhouse be kept for ever in memory for by the strength of his hand the Lord has taken you out from this place let no leavened bread be used
Exo  On this day in the month Abib you are going out
Exo  And it will be that when the Lord takes you into the land of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Hivite and the Jebusite the land which he made an oath to your fathers that he would give you a land flowing with milk and honey you will do this act of worship in this month
Exo  For seven days let your food be unleavened cakes and on the seventh day there is to be a feast to the Lord
Exo  Unleavened cakes are to be your food through all the seven days let no leavened bread be seen among you or any leaven in any part of your land
Exo  And you will say to your son in that day It is because of what the Lord did for me when I came out of Egypt
Exo  And this will be for a sign to you on your hand and for a mark on your brow so that the law of the Lord may be in your mouth for with a strong hand the Lord took you out of Egypt
Exo  So let this order be kept at the right time from year to year
Exo  And when the Lord takes you into the land of Canaan as he made his oath to you and to your fathers and gives it to you
Exo  You are to put on one side for the Lord every mothers first male child the firstfruit of her body and the first young one of every beast every male is holy to the Lord
Exo  And for the young of an ass you may give a lamb in payment or if you will not make payment for it its neck is to be broken but for all the first sons among your children let payment be made
Exo  And when your son says to you in time to come What is the reason for this say to him By the strength of his hand the Lord took us out of Egypt out of the prisonhouse
Exo  And when Pharaoh made his heart hard and would not let us go the Lord sent death on all the first sons in Egypt of man and of beast and so every first male who comes to birth is offered to the Lord but for all the first of my sons I give a price
Exo  And this will be for a sign on your hand and for a mark on your brow for by the strength of his hand the Lord took us out of Egypt
Exo  Now after Pharaoh had let the people go God did not take them through the land of the Philistines though that was near for God said If the people see war they may have a change of heart and go back to Egypt
Exo  But God took the people round by the waste land near the Red Sea and the children of Israel went up in fighting order out of the land of Egypt
Exo  And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him for Joseph had made the children of Israel take an oath saying God will certainly keep you in mind and you are to take my bones away with you
Exo  Then they went on their journey from Succoth and put up their tents in Etham at the edge of the waste land
Exo  And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud guiding them on their way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light so that they were able to go on day and night
Exo  The pillar of cloud went ever before them by day and the pillar of fire by night
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses
Exo  Give orders to the children of Israel to go back and put up their tents before Pihahiroth between Migdol and the sea in front of Baalzephon opposite to which you are to put up your tents by the sea
Exo  And Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel They are wandering without direction they are shut in by the waste land
Exo  And I will make Pharaohs heart hard and he will come after them and I will be honoured over Pharaoh and all his army so that the Egyptians may see that I am the Lord And they did so
Exo  And word came to Pharaoh of the flight of the people and the feeling of Pharaoh and of his servants about the people was changed and they said Why have we let Israel go so that they will do no more work for us
Exo  So he had his warcarriage made ready and took his people with him
Exo  And he took six hundred carriages all the carriages of Egypt and captains over all of them
Exo  And the Lord made the heart of Pharaoh hard and he went after the children of Israel for the children of Israel had gone out without fear
Exo  But the Egyptians went after them all the horses and carriages of Pharaoh and his horsemen and his army and overtook them in their tents by the sea by Pihahiroth before Baalzephon
Exo  And when Pharaoh came near the children of Israel lifting up their eyes saw the Egyptians coming after them and were full of fear and their cry went up to God
Exo  And they said to Moses Was there no restingplace for the dead in Egypt that you have taken us away to come to our death in the waste land why have you taken us out of Egypt
Exo  Did we not say to you in Egypt Let us be as we are working for the Egyptians for it is better to be the servants of the Egyptians than to come to our death in the waste land
Exo  But Moses said Keep where you are and have no fear now you will see the salvation of the Lord which he will give you today for the Egyptians whom you see today you will never see again
Exo  The Lord will make war for you you have only to keep quiet
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses Why are you crying out to me give the children of Israel the order to go forward
Exo  And let your rod be lifted up and your hand stretched out over the sea and it will be parted in two and the children of Israel will go through on dry land
Exo  And I will make the heart of the Egyptians hard and they will go in after them and I will be honoured over Pharaoh and over his army his warcarriages and his horsemen
Exo  And the Egyptians will see that I am the Lord when I get honour over Pharaoh and his warcarriages and his horsemen
Exo  Then the angel of God who had been before the tents of Israel took his place at their back and the pillar of cloud moving from before them came to rest at their back
Exo  And it came between the army of Egypt and the army of Israel and there was a dark cloud between them and they went on through the night but the one army came no nearer to the other all the night
Exo  And when Moses hand was stretched out over the sea the Lord with a strong east wind made the sea go back all night and the waters were parted in two and the sea became dry land
Exo  And the children of Israel went through the sea on dry land and the waters were a wall on their right side and on their left
Exo  Then the Egyptians went after them into the middle of the sea all Pharaohs horses and his warcarriages and his horsemen
Exo  And in the morning watch the Lord looking out on the armies of the Egyptians from the pillar of fire and cloud sent trouble on the army of the Egyptians
Exo  And made the wheels of their warcarriages stiff so that they had hard work driving them so the Egyptians said Let us go in flight from before the face of Israel for the Lord is fighting for them against the Egyptians
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses Let your hand be stretched out over the sea and the waters will come back again on the Egyptians and on their warcarriages and on their horsemen
Exo  And when Moses hand was stretched out over the sea at dawn the sea came flowing back meeting the Egyptians in their flight and the Lord sent destruction on the Egyptians in the middle of the sea
Exo  And the waters came back covering the warcarriages and the horsemen and all the army of Pharaoh which went after them into the middle of the sea not one of them was to be seen
Exo  But the children of Israel went through the sea walking on dry land and the waters were a wall on their right side and on their left
Exo  So that day the Lord gave Israel salvation from the hands of the Egyptians and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seas edge
Exo  And Israel saw the great work which the Lord had done against the Egyptians and the fear of the Lord came on the people and they had faith in the Lord and in his servant Moses
Exo  Then Moses and the children of Israel made this song to the Lord and said I will make a song to the Lord for he is lifted up in glory the horse and the horseman he has sent down into the sea
Exo  The Lord is my strength and my strong helper he has become my salvation he is my God and I will give him praise my fathers God and I will give him glory
Exo  The Lord is a man of war the Lord is his name
Exo  Pharaohs warcarriages and his army he has sent down into the sea the best of his captains have gone down into the Red Sea
Exo  They were covered by the deep waters like a stone they went down under the waves
Exo  Full of glory O Lord is the power of your right hand by your right hand those who came against you are broken
Exo  When you are lifted up in power all those who come against you are crushed when you send out your wrath they are burned up like dry grass
Exo  By your breath the waves were massed together the flowing waters were lifted up like a pillar the deep waters became solid in the heart of the sea
Exo  Egypt said I will go after them I will overtake I will make division of their goods my desire will have its way with them my sword will be uncovered my hand will send destruction on them
Exo  You sent your wind and the sea came over them they went down like lead into the great waters
Exo  Who is like you O Lord among the gods who is like you in holy glory to be praised with fear doing wonders
Exo  When your right hand was stretched out the mouth of the earth was open for them
Exo  In your mercy you went before the people whom you have made yours guiding them in your strength to your holy place
Exo  Hearing of you the peoples were shaking in fear the people of Philistia were gripped with pain
Exo  The chiefs of Edom were troubled in heart the strong men of Moab were in the grip of fear all the people of Canaan became like water
Exo  Fear and grief came on them by the strength of your arm they were turned to stone till your people went over O Lord till the people went over whom you have made yours
Exo  You will take them in planting them in the mountain of your heritage the place O Lord where you have made your house the holy place O Lord the building of your hands
Exo  The Lord is King for ever and ever
Exo  For the horses of Pharaoh with his warcarriages and his horsemen went into the sea and the Lord sent the waters of the sea back over them but the children of Israel went through the sea on dry land
Exo  And Miriam the woman prophet the sister of Aaron took an instrument of music in her hand and all the women went after her with music and dances
Exo  And Miriam answering said Make a song to the Lord for he is lifted up in glory the horse and the horseman he has sent into the sea
Exo  Then Moses took Israel forward from the Red Sea and they went out into the waste land of Shur and for three days they were in the waste land where there was no water
Exo  And when they came to Marah the water was no good for drinking for the waters of Marah were bitter which is why it was named Marah
Exo  And the people crying out against Moses said What are we to have for drink
Exo  And in answer to his prayer the Lord made him see a tree and when he put it into the water the water was made sweet There he gave them a law and an order testing them
Exo  And he said If with all your heart you will give attention to the voice of the Lord your God and do what is right in his eyes giving ear to his orders and keeping his laws I will not put on you any of the diseases which I put on the Egyptians for I am the Lord your lifegiver
Exo  And they came to Elim where there were twelve watersprings and seventy palmtrees and they put up their tents there by the waters
Exo  And they went on their way from Elim and all the children of Israel came into the waste land of Sin which is between Elim and Sinai on the fifteenth day of the second month after they went out of the land of Egypt
Exo  And all the children of Israel were crying out against Moses and Aaron in the waste land
Exo  And the children of Israel said to them It would have been better for the Lord to have put us to death in the land of Egypt where we were seated by the fleshpots and had bread enough for our needs for you have taken us out to this waste of sand to put all this people to death through need of food
Exo  Then the Lord said to Moses See I will send down bread from heaven for you and the people will go out every day and get enough for the days needs so that I may put them to the test to see if they will keep my laws or not
Exo  And on the sixth day they are to make ready what they get in and it will be twice as much as they get on the other days
Exo  And Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel This evening it will be clear to you that it is the Lord who has taken you out of the land of Egypt
Exo  And in the morning you will see the glory of the Lord for your angry words against the Lord have come to his ears and what are we that you are crying out against us
Exo  And Moses said The Lord will give you meat for your food at evening and in the morning bread in full measure for your outcry against the Lord has come to his ears for what are we your outcry is not against us but against the Lord
Exo  And Moses said to Aaron Say to all the people of Israel Come near before the Lord for he has given ear to your outcry
Exo  And while Aaron was talking to the children of Israel their eyes were turned in the direction of the waste land and they saw the glory of the Lord shining in the cloud
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses
Exo  The outcry of the children of Israel has come to my ears say to them now At nightfall you will have meat for your food and in the morning bread in full measure and you will see that I am the Lord your God
Exo  And it came about that in the evening little birds came up and the place was covered with them and in the morning there was dew all round about the tents
Exo  And when the dew was gone on the face of the earth was a small round thing like small drops of ice on the earth
Exo  And when the children of Israel saw it they said to one another What is it for they had no idea what it was And Moses said to them It is the bread which the Lord has given you for your food
Exo  This is what the Lord has said Let every man take up as much as he has need of at the rate of one omer for every person let every man take as much as is needed for his family
Exo  And the children of Israel did so and some took more and some less
Exo  And when it was measured he who had taken up much had nothing over and he who had little had enough every man had taken what he was able to make use of
Exo  And Moses said to them Let nothing be kept till the morning
Exo  But they gave no attention to Moses and some of them kept it till the morning and there were worms in it and it had an evil smell and Moses was angry with them
Exo  And they took it up morning by morning every man as he had need and when the sun was high it was gone
Exo  And on the sixth day they took up twice as much of the bread two omers for every person and all the rulers of the people gave Moses word of it
Exo  And he said This is what the Lord has said Tomorrow is a day of rest a holy Sabbath to the Lord what has to be cooked may be cooked and what is over put on one side to be kept till the morning
Exo  And they kept it till the morning as Moses had said and no smell came from it and it had no worms
Exo  And Moses said Make your meal today of what you have for this day is a Sabbath to the Lord today you will not get any in the fields
Exo  For six days you will get it but on the seventh day the Sabbath there will not be any
Exo  But still on the seventh day some of the people went out to get it and there was not any
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses How long will you go against my orders and my laws
Exo  See because the Lord has given you the Sabbath he gives you on the sixth day bread enough for two days let every man keep where he is let no man go out of his place on the seventh day
Exo  So the people took their rest on the seventh day
Exo  And this bread was named manna by Israel it was white like a grain seed and its taste was like cakes made with honey
Exo  And Moses said This is the order which the Lord has given Let one omer of it be kept for future generations so that they may see the bread which I gave you for your food in the waste land when I took you out from the land of Egypt
Exo  And Moses said to Aaron Take a pot and put one omer of manna in it and put it away before the Lord to be kept for future generations
Exo  So Aaron put it away in front of the holy chest to be kept as the Lord gave orders to Moses
Exo  And the children of Israel had manna for their food for forty years till they came to a land with people in it till they came to the edge of the land of Canaan
Exo  Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah
Exo  And the children of Israel went on from the waste land of Sin by stages as the Lord gave them orders and put up their tents in Rephidim and there was no drinkingwater for the people
Exo  So the people were angry with Moses and said Give us water for drinking And Moses said Why are you angry with me and why do you put God to the test
Exo  And the people were in great need of water and they made an outcry against Moses and said Why have you taken us out of Egypt to send death on us and our children and our cattle through need of water
Exo  And Moses crying out to the Lord said What am I to do to this people they are almost ready to put me to death by stoning
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses Go on before the people and take some of the chiefs of Israel with you and take in your hand the rod which was stretched out over the Nile and go
Exo  See I will take my place before you on the rock in Horeb and when you give the rock a blow water will come out of it and the people will have drink And Moses did so before the eyes of the chiefs of Israel
Exo  And he gave that place the name Massah and Meribah because the children of Israel were angry and because they put the Lord to the test saying Is the Lord with us or not
Exo  Then Amalek came and made war on Israel in Rephidim
Exo  And Moses said to Joshua Get together a band of men for us and go out make war on Amalek tomorrow I will take my place on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand
Exo  So Joshua did as Moses said to him and went to war with Amalek and Moses Aaron and Hur went up to the top of the hill
Exo  Now while Moses hand was lifted up Israel was the stronger but when he let his hand go down Amalek became the stronger
Exo  But Moses hands became tired so they put a stone under him and he took his seat on it Aaron and Hur supporting his hands one on one side and one on the other so his hands were kept up without falling till the sun went down
Exo  And Joshua overcame Amalek and his people with the sword
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses Make a record of this in a book so that it may be kept in memory and say it again in the ears of Joshua that all memory of Amalek is to be completely uprooted from the earth
Exo  Then Moses put up an altar and gave it the name of Yahwehnissi
Exo  For he said The Lord has taken his oath that there will be war with Amalek from generation to generation
Exo  Now news came to Jethro the priest of Midian Moses fatherinlaw of all God had done for Moses and for Israel his people and how the Lord had taken Israel out of Egypt
Exo  And Jethro Moses fatherinlaw took Zipporah Moses wife after he had sent her away
Exo  And her two sons one of whom was named Gershom for he said I have been living in a strange land
Exo  And the name of the other was Eliezer for he said The God of my father was my help and kept me safe from the sword of Pharaoh
Exo  And Jethro Moses fatherinlaw came with his sons and his wife to where Moses had put up his tent in the waste land by the mountain of God
Exo  And he said to Moses I your fatherinlaw have come to you with your wife and your two sons
Exo  And Moses went out to his fatherinlaw and went down on his face before him and gave him a kiss and they said to one another Are you well and they came into the tent
Exo  And Moses gave his fatherinlaw an account of all the Lord had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians because of Israel and of all the troubles which had come on them by the way and how the Lord had given them salvation
Exo  And Jethro was glad because the Lord had been good to Israel freeing them from the power of the Egyptians
Exo  And Jethro said Praise be to the Lord who has taken you out of the hand of Pharaoh and out of the hand of the Egyptians freeing the people from the yoke of the Egyptians
Exo  Now I am certain that the Lord is greater than all gods for he has overcome them in their pride
Exo  Then Jethro Moses fatherinlaw made a burned offering to God and Aaron came with the chiefs of Israel and had a meal with Moses fatherinlaw before God
Exo  Now on the day after Moses took his seat to give decisions for the people and the people were waiting before Moses from morning till evening
Exo  And when Moses fatherinlaw saw all he was doing he said What is this you are doing for the people why are you seated here by yourself with all the people waiting before you from morning till evening
Exo  And Moses said to his fatherinlaw Because the people come to me to get directions from God
Exo  And if they have any question between themselves they come to me and I am judge between a man and his neighbour and I give them the orders and laws of God
Exo  And Moses fatherinlaw said to him What you are doing is not good
Exo  Your strength and that of the people will be completely used up this work is more than you are able to do by yourself
Exo  Give ear now to my suggestion and may God be with you you are to be the peoples representative before God taking their causes to him
Exo  Teaching them his rules and his laws guiding them in the way they have to go and making clear to them the work they have to do
Exo  But for the rest take from among the people able men such as have the fear of God true men hating profits wrongly made and put such men over them to be captains of thousands captains of hundreds and of fifties and of tens
Exo  And let them be judges in the causes of the people at all times and let them put before you all important questions but in small things let them give decisions themselves in this way it will be less hard for you and they will take the weight off you
Exo  If you do this and God gives approval then you will be able to go on without weariness and all this people will go to their tents in peace
Exo  So Moses took note of the words of his fatherinlaw and did as he had said
Exo  And he made selection of able men out of all Israel and made them heads over the people captains of thousands captains of hundreds and of fifties and of tens
Exo  And they were judges in the causes of the people at all times the hard questions they put before Moses but on every small point they gave decisions themselves
Exo  And Moses let his fatherinlaw go away and he went back to his land
Exo  In the third month after the children of Israel went out from Egypt on the same day they came into the waste land of Sinai
Exo  And when they had gone away from Rephidim and had come into the waste land of Sinai they put up their tents in the waste land before the mountain there Israel put up its tents
Exo  And Moses went up to God and the voice of the Lord came to him from the mountain saying Say to the family of Jacob and give word to the children of Israel
Exo  You have seen what I did to the Egyptians and how I took you as on eagles wings guiding you to myself
Exo  If now you will truly give ear to my voice and keep my agreement you will be my special property out of all the peoples for all the earth is mine
Exo  And you will be a kingdom of priests to me and a holy nation These are the words which you are to say to the children of Israel
Exo  And Moses came and sent for the chiefs of the people and put before them all these words which the Lord had given him orders to say
Exo  And all the people answering together said Whatever the Lord has said we will do And Moses took back to the Lord the words of the people
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses See I will come to you in a thick cloud so that what I say to you may come to the ears of the people and they may have belief in you for ever And Moses gave the Lord word of what the people had said
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses Go to the people and make them holy today and tomorrow and let their clothing be washed
Exo  And by the third day let them be ready for on the third day the Lord will come down on Mount Sinai before the eyes of all the people
Exo  And let limits be marked out for the people round the mountain and say to them Take care not to go up the mountain or near the sides of it whoever puts his foot on the mountain will certainly come to his death
Exo  He is not to be touched by a hand but is to be stoned or have an arrow put through him man or beast he is to be put to death at the long sounding of a horn they may come up to the mountain
Exo  Then Moses went down from the mountain to the people and made the people holy and their clothing was washed
Exo  And he said to the people Be ready by the third day do not come near a woman
Exo  And when morning came on the third day there were thunders and flames and a thick cloud on the mountain and a horn sounding very loud and all the people in the tents were shaking with fear
Exo  And Moses made the people come out of their tents and take their places before God and they came to the foot of the mountain
Exo  And all the mountain of Sinai was smoking for the Lord had come down on it in fire and the smoke of it went up like the smoke of a great burning and all the mountain was shaking
Exo  And when the sound of the horn became louder and louder Moses words were answered by the voice of God
Exo  Then the Lord came down on to Mount Sinai to the top of the mountain and the Lord sent for Moses to come up to the top of the mountain and Moses went up
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses Go down and give the people orders to keep back for fear that a great number of them forcing their way through to see the Lord may come to destruction
Exo  And let the priests who come near to the Lord make themselves holy for fear that the Lord may come on them suddenly
Exo  And Moses said to the Lord The people will not be able to come up the mountain for you gave us orders to put limits round the mountain marking it out and making it holy
Exo  And the Lord said to him Go down and you and Aaron may come up but let not the priests and the people make their way through to the Lord or he will come on them suddenly
Exo  So Moses went down to the people and said this to them
Exo  And God said all these words
Exo  I am the Lord your God who took you out of the land of Egypt out of the prisonhouse
Exo  You are to have no other gods but me
Exo  You are not to make an image or picture of anything in heaven or on the earth or in the waters under the earth
Exo  You may not go down on your faces before them or give them worship for I the Lord your God am a God who will not give his honour to another and I will send punishment on the children for the wrongdoing of their fathers to the third and fourth generation of my haters
Exo  And I will have mercy through a thousand generations on those who have love for me and keep my laws
Exo  You are not to make use of the name of the Lord your God for an evil purpose whoever takes the Lords name on his lips for an evil purpose will be judged a sinner by the Lord
Exo  Keep in memory the Sabbath and let it be a holy day
Exo  On six days do all your work
Exo  But the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God on that day you are to do no work you or your son or your daughter your manservant or your womanservant your cattle or the man from a strange country who is living among you
Exo  For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth and the sea and everything in them and he took his rest on the seventh day for this reason the Lord has given his blessing to the seventh day and made it holy
Exo  Give honour to your father and to your mother so that your life may be long in the land which the Lord your God is giving you
Exo  Do not put anyone to death without cause
Exo  Do not be false to the married relation
Exo  Do not take the property of another
Exo  Do not give false witness against your neighbour
Exo  Let not your desire be turned to your neighbours house or his wife or his manservant or his womanservant or his ox or his ass or anything which is his
Exo  And all the people were watching the thunderings and the flames and the sound of the horn and the mountain smoking and when they saw it they kept far off shaking with fear
Exo  And they said to Moses To your words we will give ear but let not the voice of God come to our ears for fear death may come on us
Exo  And Moses said to the people Have no fear for God has come to put you to the test so that fearing him you may be kept from sin
Exo  And the people kept their places far off but Moses went near to the dark cloud where God was
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses Say to the children of Israel You yourselves have seen that my voice has come to you from heaven
Exo  Gods of silver and gods of gold you are not to make for yourselves
Exo  Make for me an altar of earth offering on it your burned offerings and your peaceofferings your sheep and your oxen in every place where I have put the memory of my name I will come to you and give you my blessing
Exo  And if you make me an altar of stone do not make it of cut stones for the touch of an instrument will make it unclean
Exo  And do not go up by steps to my altar for fear that your bodies may be seen uncovered
Exo  Now these are the laws which you are to put before them
Exo  If you get a Hebrew servant for money he is to be your servant for six years and in the seventh year you are to let him go free without payment
Exo  If he comes to you by himself let him go away by himself if he is married let his wife go away with him
Exo  If his master gives him a wife and he gets sons or daughters by her the wife and her children will be the property of the master and the servant is to go away by himself
Exo  But if the servant says clearly My master and my wife and children are dear to me I have no desire to be free
Exo  Then his master is to take him to the gods of the house and at the door or at its framework he is to make a hole in his ear with a sharppointed instrument and he will be his servant for ever
Exo  And if a man gives his daughter for a price to be a servant she is not to go away free as the menservants do
Exo  If she is not pleasing to her master who has taken her for himself let a payment be made for her so that she may go free her master has no power to get a price for her and send her to a strange land because he has been false to her
Exo  And if he gives her to his son he is to do everything for her as if she was his daughter
Exo  And if he takes another woman her food and clothing and her married rights are not to be less
Exo  And if he does not do these three things for her she has the right to go free without payment
Exo  He who gives a man a deathblow is himself to be put to death
Exo  But if he had no evil purpose against him and God gave him into his hand I will give you a place to which he may go in flight
Exo  But if a man makes an attack on his neighbour on purpose to put him to death by deceit you are to take him from my altar and put him to death
Exo  Any man who gives a blow to his father or his mother is certainly to be put to death

Exo  And let Aaron and his sons make a meal of it with the bread in the basket at the door of the Tent of meeting
Exo  All those things which were used as offerings to take away sin and to make them holy to be priests they may have for food but no one who is not a priest may have them for they are holy food

Exo  And this is what they are to give let every man who is numbered give half a shekel by the scale of the holy place the shekel being valued at twenty gerahs this money is an offering to the Lord

Exo  Their hands and feet are to be washed so that they may be safe from death this is an order to them for ever to him and his seed from generation to generation
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses

Exo  And make from them a perfume such as is made by the art of the perfumemaker mixed with salt and clean and holy
Exo  And put some of it crushed very small in front of the ark in the Tent of meeting where I will come face to face with you it is to be most holy
Exo  You are not to make any perfume like it for yourselves it is to be kept holy to the Lord
Exo  Whoever makes any like it for its sweet smell will be cut off from his people
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses
Exo  I have made selection of Bezalel the son of Uri by name the son of Hur of the tribe of Judah
Exo  And I have given him the spirit of God and made him wise and full of knowledge and expert in every sort of handwork
Exo  To do all sorts of delicate work in gold and silver and brass
Exo  In cutting stones for framing and to do every form of woodwork
Exo  And I have made selection of Oholiab with him the son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan and in the hearts of all who are wise I have put the knowledge to make whatever I have given you orders to have made
Exo  The Tent of meeting and the ark of the law and the cover which is on it and all the things for the tent

Exo  And the Lord said to Moses
Exo  Say to the children of Israel that they are to keep my Sabbaths for the Sabbath day is a sign between me and you through all your generations so that you may see that I am the Lord who makes you holy
Exo  So you are to keep the Sabbath as a holy day and anyone not honouring it will certainly be put to death whoever does any work on that day will be cut off from his people
Exo  Six days may work be done but the seventh day is a Sabbath of complete rest holy to the Lord whoever does any work on the Sabbath day is to be put to death
Exo  And the children of Israel are to keep the Sabbath holy from generation to generation by an eternal agreement
Exo  It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever because in six days the Lord made heaven and earth and on the seventh day he took his rest and had pleasure in it
Exo  And when his talk with Moses on Mount Sinai was ended he gave him the two stones of the law two stones on which was the writing made by the finger of God
Exo  And when the people saw that Moses was a long time coming down from the mountain they all came to Aaron and said to him Come make us a god to go before us as for this Moses who took us up out of the land of Egypt we have no idea what has become of him
Exo  Then Aaron said to them Take off the gold rings which are in the ears of your wives and your sons and your daughters and give them to me
Exo  And all the people took the gold rings from their ears and gave them to Aaron
Exo  And he took the gold from them and hammering it with an instrument he made it into the metal image of a young ox and they said This is your god O Israel who took you out of the land of Egypt
Exo  And when Aaron saw this he made an altar before it and made a public statement saying Tomorrow there will be a feast to the Lord
Exo  So early on the day after they got up and made burned offerings and peaceofferings and took their seats at the feast and then gave themselves to pleasure
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses Go down quickly for your people whom you took out of the land of Egypt are turned to evil ways
Exo  Even now they are turned away from the rule I gave them and have made themselves a metal ox and given worship to it and offerings saying This is your god O Israel who took you up out of the land of Egypt
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses I have been watching this people and I see that they are a stiffnecked people
Exo  Now do not get in my way for my wrath is burning against them I will send destruction on them but of you I will make a great nation
Exo  But Moses made prayer to God saying Lord why is your wrath burning against your people whom you took out of the land of Egypt with great power and with the strength of your hand
Exo  Why let the Egyptians say He took them out to an evil fate to put them to death on the mountains cutting them off from the earth Let your wrath be turned away from them and send not this evil on your people
Exo  Have in mind Abraham Isaac and Israel your servants to whom you gave your oath saying I will make your seed like the stars of heaven in number and all this land will I give to your seed as I said to be their heritage for ever
Exo  So the Lord let himself be turned from his purpose of sending punishment on his people
Exo  Then Moses came down the mountain with the two stones of the law in his hand the stones had writing on their two sides on the front and on the back
Exo  The stones were the work of God and the writing was the writing of God cut on the stones
Exo  Now when the noise and the voices of the people came to the ears of Joshua he said to Moses There is a noise of war in the tents
Exo  And Moses said It is not the voice of men who are overcoming in the fight or the cry of those who have been overcome it is the sound of songs which comes to my ear
Exo  And when he came near the tents he saw the image of the ox and the people dancing and in his wrath Moses let the stones go from his hands and they were broken at the foot of the mountain
Exo  And he took the ox which they had made burning it in the fire and crushing it to powder and he put it in the water and made the children of Israel take a drink of it
Exo  And Moses said to Aaron What did the people do to you that you let this great sin come on them
Exo  And Aaron said Let not my lord be angry you have seen how the purposes of this people are evil
Exo  For they said to me Make us a god to go before us as for this Moses who took us up out of the land of Egypt we have no idea what has come to him
Exo  Then I said to them Whoever has any gold let him take it off so they gave it to me and I put it in the fire and this image of an ox came out
Exo  And Moses saw that the people were out of control for Aaron had let them loose to their shame before their haters
Exo  Then Moses took his place at the way into the tents and said Whoever is on the Lords side let him come to me And all the sons of Levi came together to him
Exo  And he said to them This is the word of the Lord the God of Israel Let every man take his sword at his side and go from one end of the tents to the other putting to death his brother and his friend and his neighbour
Exo  And the sons of Levi did as Moses said and about three thousand of the people were put to death that day
Exo  And Moses said You have made yourselves priests to the Lord this day for every one of you has made the offering of his son and his brother the blessing of the Lord is on you this day
Exo  And on the day after Moses said to the people Great has been your sin but I will go up to the Lord and see if I may get forgiveness for your sin
Exo  Then Moses went back to the Lord and said This people has done a great sin making themselves a god of gold
Exo  But now if you will give them forgivenessbut if not let my name be taken out of your book
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses Whoever has done evil against me will be taken out of my book
Exo  But now go take the people into that place of which I have given you word see my angel will go before you but when the time of my judging has come I will send punishment on them for their sin
Exo  And the Lord sent punishment on the people because they gave worship to the ox which Aaron made
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses Go forward from this place you and the people whom you have taken up out of the land of Egypt to that land about which I made an oath to Abraham Isaac and Jacob saying To your seed will I give it
Exo  And I will send an angel before you driving out the Canaanite and the Amorite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite
Exo  Go up to that land flowing with milk and honey but I will not go up among you for you are a stiffnecked people for fear that I send destruction on you while you are on the way
Exo  Hearing this bad news the people were full of grief and no one put on his ornaments
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses Say to the children of Israel You are a stiffnecked people if I come among you even for a minute I will send destruction on you so take off all your ornaments so that I may see what to do with you
Exo  So the children of Israel took off their ornaments at Mount Horeb and did not put them on again
Exo  Now it was Moses way to put up the Tent of meeting outside the tentcircle at some distance away giving it the name of The Tent of meeting And everyone desiring to make his prayer to the Lord went to the Tent of meeting outside the tentcircle
Exo  And whenever Moses went out to the Tent of meeting all the people got up and everyone went to the door of his tent looking after Moses till he went inside the Tent
Exo  And whenever Moses went into the Tent the pillar of cloud came down and took its place by the door of the Tent as long as the Lord was talking with Moses
Exo  And all the people saw the cloud at the door of the Tent and they went down on their faces everyone at the door of his tent
Exo  And the Lord had talk with Moses face to face as a man may have talk with his friend And when Moses came back to the tents his servant the young man Joshua the son of Nun did not come away from the Tent
Exo  And Moses said to the Lord See you say to me Be this peoples guide on their journey but you have not made clear to me whom you will send with me But you have said I have knowledge of you by name and you have grace in my eyes
Exo  If then I have grace in your eyes let me see your ways so that I may have knowledge of you and be certain of your grace and my prayer is that you will keep in mind that this nation is your people
Exo  And he said I myself will go with you and give you rest
Exo  And Moses said If you yourself are not going with us do not send us on from here
Exo  For is not the fact of your going with us the sign that I and this people have grace in your eyes so that we that is I and your people are separate from all other people on the face of the earth
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses I will do as you say for you have grace in my eyes and I have knowledge of you by your name
Exo  And Moses said O Lord let me see your glory
Exo  And he said I will make all the light of my being come before you and will make clear to you what I am I will be kind to those to whom I will be kind and have mercy on those on whom I will have mercy
Exo  But it is not possible for you to see my face for no man may see me and still go on living
Exo  And the Lord said See there is a place near me and you may take your place on the rock
Exo  And when my glory goes by I will put you in a hole in the rock covering you with my hand till I have gone past
Exo  Then I will take away my hand and you will see my back but my face is not to be seen
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses Make two other stones like the first two and I will put on them the words which were on the first stones which were broken by you
Exo  And be ready by the morning and come up on Mount Sinai and come before me there in the morning on the top of the mountain
Exo  No one is to come up with you and let no man be seen anywhere on the mountain let no flocks or herds come near to get their food at its foot
Exo  So Moses got two stones cut like the first and early in the morning he went up Mount Sinai as the Lord had said with the two stones in his hand
Exo  And the Lord came down in the cloud and took his place by the side of Moses and Moses gave worship to the name of the Lord
Exo  And the Lord went past before his eyes saying The Lord the Lord a God full of pity and grace slow to wrath and great in mercy and faith
Exo  Having mercy on thousands overlooking evil and wrongdoing and sin he will not let wrongdoers go free but will send punishment on children for the sins of their fathers and on their childrens children to the third and fourth generation
Exo  Then Moses quickly went down on his face in worship
Exo  And he said If now I have grace in your eyes let the Lord go among us for this is a stiffnecked people and give us forgiveness for our wrongdoing and our sin and take us for your heritage
Exo  And the Lord said See this is what I will undertake before the eyes of your people I will do wonders such as have not been done in all the earth or in any nation and all your people will see the work of the Lord for what I am about to do for you is greatly to be feared
Exo  Take care to do the orders which I give you today I will send out from before you the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite
Exo  But take care and do not make any agreement with the people of the land where you are going for it will be a cause of sin to you
Exo  But their altars are to be overturned and their pillars broken and their images cut down
Exo  For you are to be worshippers of no other god for the Lord is a God who will not give his honour to another
Exo  So see that you make no agreement with the people of the land and do not go after their gods or take part in their offerings or be guests at their feasts
Exo  Or take their daughters for your sons for when their daughters give worship before their gods they will make your sons take part with them
Exo  Make for yourselves no gods of metal
Exo  Keep the feast of unleavened bread for seven days your food is to be bread without leaven as I gave you orders at the regular time in the month Abib for in that month you came out of Egypt
Exo  Every first male child is mine the first male birth of your cattle the first male of every ox and sheep
Exo  A lamb may be given in payment for the young of an ass but if you will not make payment for it its neck will have to be broken For all the first of your sons you are to make payment No one is to come before me without an offering
Exo  Six days let work be done but on the seventh day take your rest at ploughing time and at the graincutting you are to have a day for rest
Exo  And you are to keep the feast of weeks when you get in the firstfruits of the grain and the feast at the turn of the year when you take in the produce of your fields
Exo  Three times in the year let all your males come before the Lord the God of Israel
Exo  For I will send out the nations before you and make wide the limits of your land and no man will make an attempt to take your land while you go up to give worship to the Lord three times in the year
Exo  No leaven is to be offered with the blood of my offering and the offering of the Passover feast may not be kept till the morning
Exo  Take the firstfruits of your land as an offering to the house of the Lord your God Let not the young goat be cooked in its mothers milk
Exo  And the Lord said to Moses Put all these words in writing for on them is based the agreement which I will make with you
Exo  And for forty days and forty nights Moses was there with the Lord and in that time he had no food or drink And he put in writing on the stones the words of the agreement the ten rules of the law
Exo  Now when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two stones in his hand he was not conscious that his face was shining because of his talk with God
Exo  But when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses and the shining of his face they would not come near him for fear
Exo  Then Moses sent for them and Aaron with the chiefs of the people came to him and Moses had talk with them
Exo  And later all the children of Israel came near and he gave them all the orders which the Lord had given him on Mount Sinai
Exo  And at the end of his talk with them Moses put a veil over his face
Exo  But whenever Moses went in before the Lord to have talk with him he took off the veil till he came out And whenever he came out he said to the children of Israel what he had been ordered to say
Exo  And the children of Israel saw that the face of Moses was shining so Moses put the veil over his face again till he went to the Lord
Exo  And Moses sent for all the children of Israel to come together and said to them This is what the Lord has said and these are his orders
Exo  Six days let work be done but the seventh day is to be a holy day to you a Sabbath of rest to the Lord whoever does any work on that day is to be put to death
Exo  No fire is to be lighted in any of your houses on the Sabbath day
Exo  And Moses said to all the meeting of the children of Israel This is the order which the Lord has given
Exo  Take from among you an offering to the Lord everyone who has the impulse in his heart let him give his offering to the Lord gold and silver and brass
Exo  And blue and purple and red and the best linen and goats hair
Exo  And sheepskins coloured red and leather and hard wood
Exo  And oil for the lights and spices for the holy oil and for the sweet perfumes for burning
Exo  And beryls and jewels to be cut for the ephod and for the priests bag
Exo  And let every wisehearted man among you come and make whatever has been ordered by the Lord
Exo  The House and its tent and its cover its hooks and its boards its rods and its pillars and its bases
Exo  The ark with its cover and its rods and the veil hanging before it
Exo  The table and its rods and all its vessels and the holy bread
Exo  And the support for the lights with its vessels and its lights and the oil for the light
Exo  And the altar for burning spices with its rods and the holy oil and the sweet perfume and the curtain for the door at the door of the House

Exo  The nails for the House and the nails for the open space and their cords
Exo  The robes of needlework for the work of the holy place the holy robes for Aaron the priest and the robes for his sons when acting as priests
Exo  And all the children of Israel went away from Moses
Exo  And everyone whose heart was moved everyone who was guided by the impulse of his spirit came with his offering for the Lord for whatever was needed for the Tent of meeting and its work and for the holy robes
Exo  They came men and women all who were ready to give and gave pins and noserings and fingerrings and neckornaments all of gold everyone gave an offering of gold to the Lord
Exo  And everyone who had blue and purple and red and the best linen and goats hair and sheepskins coloured red and leather gave them
Exo  Everyone who had silver and brass gave an offering of them to the Lord and everyone who had hard wood such as was needed for the work gave it
Exo  And all the women who were expert with their hands made cloth and gave the work of their hands blue and purple and red and the best linen
Exo  And those women who had the knowledge made the goats hair into cloth
Exo  And the rulers gave the beryls and the cut jewels for the ephod and the priests bag
Exo  And the spice and the oil for the light and the holy oil and the sweet perfumes
Exo  The children of Israel every man and woman from the impulse of their hearts gave their offerings freely to the Lord for the work which the Lord had given Moses orders to have done
Exo  And Moses said to the children of Israel See the Lord has made selection of Bezalel the son of Uri the son of Hur of the tribe of Judah
Exo  And he has made him full of the spirit of God in all wisdom and knowledge and art of every sort
Exo  As an expert designer of beautiful things working in gold and silver and brass
Exo  Trained in the cutting of stones and the ornamenting of wood and in every sort of handwork
Exo  And he has given to him and to Oholiab the son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan the power of training others
Exo  To them he has given knowledge of all the arts of the handworker of the designer and the expert workman of the maker of needlework in blue and purple and red and the best linen and of the maker of cloth in all the arts of the designer and the trained workman they are expert
Exo  So let Bezalel and Oholiab get to work with every wisehearted man to whom the Lord has given wisdom and knowledge to do whatever is necessary for the ordering of the holy place as the Lord has given orders
Exo  Then Moses sent for Bezalel and Oholiab and for all the wisehearted men to whom the Lord had given wisdom even everyone who was moved by the impulse of his heart to come and take part in the work
Exo  And they took from Moses all the offerings which the children of Israel had given for the building of the holy place And still they went on giving him more free offerings every morning
Exo  Then the wise men who were doing all the work of the holy place came from their work
Exo  And said to Moses The people are giving much more than is needed for the work which the Lord has given us orders to do
Exo  So Moses made an order and had it given out through all the tents saying Let no man or woman make any more offerings for the holy place So the people were kept from giving more
Exo  For the material they had was enough and more than enough for all the work which had to be done
Exo  Then all the expert workmen among them made the House with its ten curtains of the best linen blue and purple and red they made them with winged ones worked by expert designers
Exo  Every curtain was twentyeight cubits long and four cubits wide all of the same measure
Exo  And five curtains were joined together and the other five curtains were joined together

Exo  Fifty twists on the one curtain and fifty on the edge of the curtain of the other group the twists being opposite to one another
Exo  And they made fifty hooks of gold joining the curtains one to another with the hooks and so the House was made

Lev  And the flesh of the praiseoffering is to be taken as food on the day when it is offered no part of it may be kept till the morning
Lev  But if his offering is made because of an oath or given freely it may be taken as food on the day when it is offered and the rest may be used up on the day after
Lev  But if any of the flesh of the offering is still unused on the third day it is to be burned with fire
Lev  And if any of the flesh of the peaceoffering is taken as food on the third day it will not be pleasing to God and will not be put to the account of him who gives it it will be unclean and a cause of sin to him who takes it as food
Lev  And flesh touched by any unclean thing may not be taken for food it is to be burned with fire and as for the flesh of the peaceofferings everyone who is clean may take it as food
Lev  But he who is unclean when he takes as food the flesh of the peaceofferings which are the Lords will be cut off from his people
Lev  And anyone who after touching any unclean thing of man or an unclean beast or any unclean and disgusting thing takes as food the flesh of the peaceofferings which are the Lords will be cut off from his people
Lev  And the Lord said to Moses
Lev  Say to the children of Israel You are not to take any fat of ox or sheep or goat for food
Lev  And the fat of that which comes to a natural death and the fat of that which is attacked by beasts may be used for other purposes but not in any way for food
Lev  For anyone who takes as food the fat of any beast of which men make an offering by fire to the Lord will be cut off from his people
Lev  And you are not to take for food any blood of bird or of beast in any of your houses
Lev  Whoever takes any blood for food will be cut off from his people
Lev  And the Lord said to Moses
Lev  Say to the children of Israel He who makes a peaceoffering to the Lord is to give an offering to the Lord out of his peaceoffering
Lev  He himself is to take to the Lord the offering made by fire even the fat with the breast so that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the Lord
Lev  And the fat is to be burned by the priest on the altar but the breast is for Aaron and his sons
Lev  And the right leg you are to give to the priest for an offering to be lifted up out of what is given for your peaceofferings
Lev  That man among the sons of Aaron by whom the blood of the peaceoffering and the fat are offered is to have the right leg for his part
Lev  For the breast which is waved and the right leg which is lifted up on high I have taken from the children of Israel from their peaceofferings and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons as their right for ever from the children of Israel
Lev  This is the holy part given to Aaron and to his sons out of the offerings made to the Lord by fire on the day when they were made priests before the Lord
Lev  Which the Lord said the children of Israel were to give them on the day when he made them his priests It is their right for ever from generation to generation
Lev  These are the laws for the burned offering the meal offering and the offering for wrongdoing and for the making of priests and for the giving of peaceofferings
Lev  As they were given by the Lord to Moses on Mount Sinai on the day when the Lord gave orders to the children of Israel to make their offerings to the Lord in the waste land of Sinai
Lev  And the Lord said to Moses
Lev  Take Aaron and his sons with him and the robes and the holy oil and the ox of the sinoffering and the two male sheep and the basket of unleavened bread
Lev  And let all the people come together at the door of the Tent of meeting
Lev  And Moses did as the Lord said and all the people came together at the door of the Tent of meeting
Lev  And Moses said to the people This is what the Lord has given orders to be done
Lev  Then Moses took Aaron and his sons and after washing them with water
Lev  He put the coat on him making it tight with its band and then the robe and over it the ephod with its band of needlework to keep it in place
Lev  And he put the priests bag on him and in the bag he put the Urim and Thummim
Lev  And on his head he put the headdress and in front of the headdress the plate of gold the holy crown as the Lord gave orders to Moses
Lev  And Moses took the holy oil and put it on the House and on all the things in it to make them holy
Lev  Seven times he put oil on the altar and on all its vessels and on the washingbasin and its base to make them holy
Lev  And some of the oil he put on Aarons head to make him holy
Lev  Then he took Aarons sons clothing them with the coats and putting the bands round them and the headdresses on their heads as the Lord had given him orders
Lev  And he took the ox of the sinoffering and Aaron and his sons put their hands on the head of the ox
Lev  And he put it to death and Moses took the blood and put it on the horns of the altar and round it with his finger and made the altar clean draining out the blood at the base of the altar so he made it holy taking away what was unclean
Lev  And he took all the fat on the inside parts and the fat on the liver and the two kidneys with their fat to be burned on the altar
Lev  But the ox with its skin and its flesh and its waste was burned with fire outside the tentcircle as the Lord gave orders to Moses
Lev  And he put the male sheep of the burned offering before the Lord and Aaron and his sons put their hands on its head
Lev  And he put it to death and Moses put some of the blood on and round the altar
Lev  And when the sheep had been cut into parts the head and the parts and the fat were burned by Moses
Lev  And the inside parts and the legs were washed with water and all the sheep was burned by Moses on the altar it was a burned offering for a sweet smell it was an offering made by fire to the Lord as the Lord gave orders to Moses
Lev  And he put the other sheep before the Lord the sheep with which they were made priests and Aaron and his sons put their hands on the head of the sheep
Lev  And he put it to death and Moses took some of the blood and put it on the point of Aarons right ear and on the thumb of his right hand and on the great toe of his right foot
Lev  Then he took Aarons sons and Moses put some of the blood on the point of their right ears and on the thumbs of their right hands and on the great toes of their right feet and Moses put the blood on and round the altar
Lev  And he took the fat and the fat tail and the fat on the inside parts and the fat on the liver and the two kidneys with their fat and the right leg
Lev  And out of the basket of unleavened bread which was before the Lord he took one unleavened cake and one cake of bread with oil on it and one thin cake and put them on the fat and on the right leg
Lev  And he put them all on the hands of Aaron and on the hands of his sons waving them for a wave offering before the Lord
Lev  And Moses took them from their hands and they were burned on the altar on the burned offering as a priests offering for a sweet smell an offering made by fire to the Lord
Lev  And Moses took the breast waving it for a wave offering before the Lord it was Moses part of the sheep of the priests offering as the Lord gave orders to Moses
Lev  And Moses took some of the holy oil and of the blood which was on the altar and put it on Aaron and on his robes and on his sons and on his sons robes and made Aaron holy and his robes and his sons and his sons robes with him
Lev  And Moses said to Aaron and to his sons The flesh is to be cooked in water at the door of the Tent of meeting and there you are to take it as food together with the bread in the basket as I have given orders saying It is the food of Aaron and his sons
Lev  And that which is over of the flesh and of the bread is to be burned with fire
Lev  And you are not to go out from the door of the Tent of meeting for seven days till the days for making you priest are ended for this will be the work of seven days
Lev  What has been done this day has been ordered by the Lord to take away your sin
Lev  And you are to keep watch for the Lord at the door of the Tent of meeting day and night for seven days so that death may not come to you for so he has given me orders
Lev  And Aaron and his sons did all the things about which the Lord had given orders through Moses
Lev  And on the eighth day Moses sent for Aaron and his sons and the responsible men of Israel
Lev  And he said to Aaron Take a young ox for a sinoffering and a male sheep for a burned offering without a mark and make an offering of them before the Lord
Lev  And say to the children of Israel Take a hegoat for a sinoffering and a young ox and a lamb in their first year without any mark on them for a burned offering
Lev  And an ox and a male sheep for peaceofferings to be put to death before the Lord and a meal offering mixed with oil for this day you are to see the Lord
Lev  And they took the things ordered by Moses before the Tent of meeting and all the people came near waiting before the Lord
Lev  And Moses said This is what the Lord has said you are to do and you will see the glory of the Lord
Lev  And Moses said to Aaron Come near to the altar and make your sinoffering and your burned offering to take away your sin and the sin of the people and make the peoples offering to take away their sin as the Lord has given orders
Lev  So Aaron came near to the altar and put to death the ox for the sinoffering for himself
Lev  And the sons of Aaron gave him the blood and he put his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar draining out the blood at the base of the altar
Lev  But the fat and the kidneys and the fat on the liver of the sinoffering were burned by him on the altar as the Lord gave orders to Moses
Lev  And the flesh and the skin were burned with fire outside the tentcircle
Lev  And he put to death the burned offering and Aarons sons gave him the blood and he put some of it on and round the altar
Lev  And they gave him the parts of the burned offering in their order and the head to be burned on the altar
Lev  And the inside parts and the legs when they had been washed with water were burned on the burned offering on the altar
Lev  And he made an offering for the people and took the goat of the sinoffering for the people and put it to death offering it for sin in the same way as the first
Lev  And he took the burned offering offering it in the ordered way
Lev  And he put the meal offering before the Lord and taking some of it in his hand he had it burned on the altar separately from the burned offering of the morning
Lev  And he put to death the ox and the sheep which were the peaceofferings for the people and Aarons sons gave him the blood and he put some of it on and round the altar
Lev  And as for the fat of the ox and the fat tail of the sheep and the fat covering the inside parts and the kidneys and the fat on the liver
Lev  They put the fat on the breasts and the fat was burned on the altar
Lev  And Aaron took the breasts and the right leg waving them for a wave offering before the Lord as Moses gave orders
Lev  And Aaron lifting up his hands to the people gave them a blessing and he came down from offering the sinoffering and the burned offering and the peaceofferings
Lev  And Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of meeting and came out and gave the people a blessing and the glory of the Lord was seen by all the people
Lev  And fire came out from before the Lord burning up the offering on the altar and the fat and when all the people saw it they gave a loud cry falling down on their faces
Lev  And Nadab and Abihu the sons of Aaron took their vessels and put fire in them and perfume burning strange fire before the Lord which he had not given them orders to do
Lev  And fire came out from before the Lord burning them up and causing their destruction before the Lord
Lev  Then Moses said to Aaron This is what the Lord said I will be holy in the eyes of all those who come near to me and I will be honoured before all the people And Aaron said nothing
Lev  And Moses sent for Mishael and Elzaphan the sons of Uzziel the brother of Aarons father and said to them Come near and take your brothers away from before the holy place outside the tentcircle
Lev  So they came and took them in their coats outside the tentcircle as Moses had said
Lev  And Moses said to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar his sons Do not let your hair be loose and give no signs of grief so that death may not overtake you and his wrath come on all the people but let there be weeping among your brothers and all the house of Israel for this burning of the Lords fire
Lev  And do not go out from the door of the Tent of meeting or death will come to you for the holy oil of the Lord is on you And they did as Moses said
Lev  And the Lord said to Aaron
Lev  Take no wine or strong drink you or your sons with you when you go into the Tent of meeting that it may not be the cause of death to you this is an order for ever through all your generations
Lev  And make a division between the holy and the common and between the unclean and the clean
Lev  Teaching the children of Israel all the laws which the Lord has given them by the hand of Moses
Lev  And Moses said to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar his sons who were still living Take the rest of the meal offering from the offerings of the Lord made by fire and take it for your food without leaven at the side of the altar for it is most holy
Lev  It is to be for your food in a holy place because it is your right and your sons right from the offerings of the Lord made by fire for so am I ordered
Lev  And the breast which is waved and the leg which is lifted up on high you are to take as your food in a clean place you and your sons and your daughters with you for they are given to you as your right and your sons right from the peaceofferings of the children of Israel
Lev  Let them take the breast which is waved and the leg which is lifted up on high with the fat of the burned offering to be waved for a wave offering before the Lord and this will be for you and for your sons with you for a right for ever as the Lord has given orders
Lev  And Moses was looking for the goat of the sinoffering but it was burned and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar the sons of Aaron who were still living saying
Lev  Why did you not make a meal of the sinoffering in the holy place For it is most holy and he has given it to you so that the sin of the people may be put on it to take away their sin before the Lord
Lev  See its blood was not taken into the holy place certainly it was right for you to have taken it as food in the holy place as I gave orders
Lev  And Aaron said to Moses You have seen that today they have made their sinoffering and their burned offering before the Lord and such things as these have come on me If I had taken the sinoffering as food today would it have been pleasing to the Lord
Lev  And after hearing this Moses was no longer angry
Lev  And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron
Lev  Say to the children of Israel These are the living things which you may have for food among all the beasts on the earth
Lev  You may have as food any beast which has a division in the horn of its foot and whose food comes back into its mouth to be crushed again
Lev  But at the same time of those beasts you may not take for food the camel because its food comes back but the horn of its foot is not parted in two it is unclean to you
Lev  And the rockbadger for the same reason is unclean to you
Lev  And the hare because the horn of its foot is not parted in two is unclean to you
Lev  And the pig is unclean to you because though the horn of its foot is parted its food does not come back
Lev  Their flesh may not be used for food and their dead bodies may not even be touched they are unclean to you
Lev  These you may have for food of all things living in the water anything living in the water in the seas or rivers which has special parts for swimming and skin formed of thin plates may be used for food
Lev  All other things living and moving in the water in the sea or in the rivers are a disgusting thing to you
Lev  They may not be used for food and their dead bodies are disgusting to you
Lev  Anything in the water which has no special parts for swimming and no thin plates on its skin is disgusting to you

Lev  But of the winged fourfooted things those which have long legs for jumping on the earth you may have for food
Lev  Such as all the different sorts of locust
Lev  But all other winged fourfooted things which go on the earth are disgusting to you
Lev  By these you will be made unclean anyone touching their dead bodies will be unclean till evening
Lev  Whoever takes away the dead body of one of them is to have his clothing washed and will be unclean till evening
Lev  Every beast in the horn of whose foot there is not a complete division and whose food does not come back is unclean to you anyone touching one of these will be unclean
Lev  Any fourfooted beast which goes on the ball of its foot is unclean to you anyone touching the dead body of one of these will be unclean till evening

Lev  The dead body of any of these falling on anything will make that thing unclean if it is any vessel of wood or clothing or skin or bag whatever it is if it is used for any purpose it will have to be put into water and will be unclean till evening after that it will be clean
Lev  And if one of them gets into any vessel of earth whatever is in the vessel will be unclean and the vessel will have to be broken

Lev  Any part of the dead body of one of these falling on anything will make it unclean if it is an oven or a cookingpot it will have to be broken they are unclean and will be unclean to you
Lev  But at the same time a fountain or a place where water is stored for use will be clean but anyone touching their dead bodies will be unclean
Lev  If any part of the dead body of one of these gets on to any seed for planting it is clean
Lev  But if water is put on the seed and any part of the dead body gets on to it it will be unclean to you

Lev  Everything which goes flat on its body on the earth is disgusting and is not to be used for food
Lev  Whatever goes on its stomach or on four feet or has a great number of feet even all those going flat on the earth may not be used for food for they are disgusting
Lev  You are not to make yourselves disgusting with anything which goes about flat on the earth you may not make yourselves unclean with them in such a way that you are not holy to me
Lev  For I am the Lord your God for this reason make and keep yourselves holy for I am holy you are not to make yourselves unclean with any sort of thing which goes about flat on the earth
Lev  For I am the Lord who took you out of the land of Egypt to be your God so be you holy for I am holy
Lev  This is the law about beasts and birds and every living thing moving in the waters and every living thing which goes flat on the earth
Lev  Marking out the unclean from the clean and the living thing which may be used for food from that which may not
Lev  And the Lord said to Moses

Lev  And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron
Lev  If a man has on his skin a growth or a mark or a white place and it becomes the disease of a leper let him be taken to Aaron the priest or to one of the priests his sons
Lev  And if when the priest sees the mark on his skin the hair on the place is turned white and the mark seems to go deeper than the skin it is the mark of a leper and the priest after looking at him will say that he is unclean
Lev  But if the mark on his skin is white and does not seem to go deeper than the skin and the hair on it is not turned white then the priest will keep him shut up for seven days
Lev  And the priest is to see him on the seventh day and if in his opinion the place on his skin has not become worse and is not increased in size then the priest will keep him shut up for seven days more
Lev  And the priest is to see him again on the seventh day and if the mark is less bright and is not increased on his skin then let the priest say that he is clean it is only a skinmark and after his clothing has been washed he will be clean
Lev  But if the size of the mark on his skin is increased after he has been seen by the priest let him go to the priest again
Lev  And if after looking at him he sees that the mark is increased in his skin let the priest say that he is unclean he is a leper
Lev  When the disease of a leper is seen on a man let him be taken to the priest
Lev  And if the priest sees that there is a white growth on the skin and the hair is turned white and there is diseased flesh in the growth
Lev  It is an old disease in the skin of his flesh and the priest will say that he is unclean he will not have to be shut up for he is clearly unclean
Lev  And if the disease comes out all over his skin from his head to his feet as far as the priest is able to see
Lev  And if the priest sees that all his flesh is covered with the lepers disease the priest will say that he is clean it is all turned white he is clean
Lev  But whenever diseased flesh is seen on him he will be unclean
Lev  And when the priest sees the diseased flesh he will say that he is unclean the diseased flesh is unclean he is a leper
Lev  Or if the diseased flesh is turned again and changed to white then he is to come to the priest
Lev  And the priest will see him and if the place is turned white then the priest will say that he is free from the disease
Lev  And if a bad place has come out on the skin and is well again
Lev  And on the same place there is a white growth of a bright mark red and white then let the priest see it
Lev  And after looking at it if it seems to go deeper than the skin and the hair on it is turned white then the priest will say that the man is unclean it is the lepers disease it has come out in the bad place
Lev  But if after looking at it he sees that there are no white hairs on it and it is not deeper than the skin and it is not very bright then let the priest keep him shut up for seven days

Lev  And on the seventh day the priest will see the place and if it is not increased and does not seem to go deeper than the skin the priest will say that he is clean and after his clothing has been washed he will be clean

Lev  And if the hair has gone from the front part of his head so that he has no hair there still he is clean
Lev  But if on his head or on his brow where he has no hair there is a red and white place it is the disease of the leper coming out on his head or on his brow
Lev  Then if the priest sees that the growth of the disease has become red and white on his head or on his brow where there is no hair like the mark in the skin of a leper

Lev  Then the priest is to give orders to take for him who is to be made clean two living clean birds and some cedar wood and red thread and hyssop
Lev  And the priest will give orders for one of the birds to be put to death in a vessel made of earth over flowing water
Lev  And he will take the living bird and the wood and the red thread and the hyssop and put them in the blood of the bird which was put to death over flowing water

Lev  And the priest is to take one of the male lambs and give it as an offering for wrongdoing and the log of oil waving them for a wave offering before the Lord
Lev  And he is to put the male lamb to death in the place where they put to death the sinoffering and the burned offering in the holy place for as the sinoffering is the property of the priest so is the offering for wrongdoing it is most holy
Lev  And let the priest take some of the blood of the offering for wrongdoing and put it on the point of the right ear of him who is to be made clean and on the thumb of his right hand and on the great toe of his right foot

Lev  But any person for whom the priest has given money to make him his may take of it with him and those who come to birth in his house may take of his bread
Lev  And if the daughter of a priest is married to an outside person she may not take of the holy things which are lifted up as offerings
Lev  But if a priests daughter is a widow or parted from her husband and has no child and has come back to her fathers house as when she was a girl she may take of her fathers bread but no outside person may do so
Lev  And if a man takes the holy food in error he will have to give the holy thing back to the priest with the addition of a fifth part
Lev  And they may not make common the holy things which the children of Israel give to the Lord
Lev  So causing sin to come on them when they take their holy things for food I am the Lord who make them holy
Lev  And the Lord said to Moses
Lev  Say to Aaron and to his sons and to all the children of Israel If any man of the children of Israel or of another nation living in Israel makes an offering given because of an oath or freely given to the Lord for a burned offering
Lev  So that it may be pleasing to the Lord let him give a male without any mark from among the oxen or the sheep or the goats
Lev  But anything which has a mark you may not give it will not make you pleasing to the Lord

Lev  And when you make an offering of praise to the Lord make it in a way which is pleasing to him

Lev  And a son of an Israelite woman whose father was an Egyptian went out among the children of Israel and had a fight with a man of Israel by the tents
Lev  And the son of the Israelite woman said evil against the holy Name with curses and they took him to Moses His mothers name was Shelomith the daughter of Dibri of the tribe of Dan
Lev  And they kept him shut up till a decision might be given by the mouth of the Lord
Lev  And the Lord said to Moses
Lev  Take the curser outside the tentcircle and let all in whose hearing the words were said put their hands on his head and let him be stoned by all the people
Lev  And say to the children of Israel As for any man cursing God his sin will be on his head
Lev  And he who says evil against the name of the Lord will certainly be put to death he will be stoned by all the people the man who is not of your nation and one who is an Israelite by birth whoever says evil against the holy Name is to be put to death
Lev  And anyone who takes anothers life is certainly to be put to death
Lev  And anyone wounding a beast and causing its death will have to make payment for it a life for a life
Lev  And if a man does damage to his neighbour as he has done so let it be done to him
Lev  Wound for wound eye for eye tooth for tooth whatever damage he has done so let it be done to him
Lev  He who puts a beast to death will have to make payment for it he who puts a man to death will himself be put to death
Lev  You are to have the same law for a man of another nation living among you as for an Israelite for I am the Lord your God
Lev  And Moses said these words to the children of Israel and they took the man who had been cursing outside the tentcircle and had him stoned The children of Israel did as the Lord gave orders to Moses
Lev  And the Lord said to Moses on Mount Sinai
Lev  Say to the children of Israel When you come into the land which I will give you let the land keep a Sabbath to the Lord
Lev  For six years put seed into your land and for six years give care to your vines and get in the produce of them
Lev  But let the seventh year be a Sabbath of rest for the land a Sabbath to the Lord do not put seed into your land or have your vines cut
Lev  That which comes to growth of itself may not be cut and the grapes of your uncaredfor vines may not be taken off let it be a year of rest for the land
Lev  And the Sabbath of the land will give food for you and your manservant and your womanservant and those working for payment and for those of another country who are living among you
Lev  And for your cattle and the beasts on the land all the natural increase of the land will be for food
Lev  And let seven Sabbaths of years be numbered to you seven times seven years even the days of seven Sabbaths of years that is fortynine years
Lev  Then let the loud horn be sounded far and wide on the tenth day of the seventh month on the day of taking away sin let the horn be sounded through all your land
Lev  And let this fiftieth year be kept holy and say publicly that everyone in the land is free from debt it is the Jubilee and every man may go back to his heritage and to his family
Lev  Let this fiftieth year be the Jubilee no seed may be planted and that which comes to growth of itself may not be cut and the grapes may not be taken from the uncaredfor vines
Lev  For it is the Jubilee and it is holy to you your food will be the natural increase of the field
Lev  In this year of Jubilee let every man go back to his heritage
Lev  And in the business of trading goods for money do no wrong to one another
Lev  Let your exchange of goods with your neighbours have relation to the number of years after the year of Jubilee and the number of times the earth has given her produce
Lev  If the number of years is great the price will be increased and if the number of years is small the price will be less for it is the produce of a certain number of years which the man is giving you
Lev  And do no wrong one to another but let the fear of your God be before you for I am the Lord your God
Lev  So keep my rules and my decisions and do them and you will be safe in your land
Lev  And the land will give her fruit and you will have food in full measure and be safe in the land
Lev  And if you say Where will our food come from in the seventh year when we may not put in seed or get in the increase
Lev  Then I will send my blessing on you in the sixth year and the land will give fruit enough for three years
Lev  And in the eighth year you will put in your seed and get your food from the old stores till the fruit of the ninth year is ready
Lev  No exchange of land may be for ever for the land is mine and you are as my guests living with me for a time
Lev  Wherever there is property in land the owner is to have the right of getting it back
Lev  If your brother becomes poor and has to give up some of his land for money his nearest relation may come and get back that which his brother has given up
Lev  And if he has no one to get it back for him and later he himself gets wealth and has enough money to get it back
Lev  Then let him take into account the years from the time when he gave it up and make up the loss for the rest of the years to him who took it and so get back his property
Lev  But if he is not able to get it back for himself then it will be kept by him who gave a price for it till the year of Jubilee and in that year it will go back to its first owner and he will have his property again
Lev  And if a man gives his house in a walled town for money he has the right to get it back for the space of a full year after he has given it up
Lev  And if he does not get it back by the end of the year then the house in the town will become the property of him who gave the money for it and of his children for ever it will not go from him in the year of Jubilee
Lev  But houses in small unwalled towns will be the same as property in the country they may be got back and they will go back to their owners in the year of Jubilee
Lev  But the houses in the towns of the Levites may be got back by the Levites at any time
Lev  And if a Levite does not give money to get back his property his house in the town which was exchanged for money will come back to him in the year of Jubilee For the houses of the towns of the Levites are their property among the children of Israel
Lev  But the land on the outskirts of their towns may not be exchanged for money for it is their property for ever
Lev  And if your brother becomes poor and is not able to make a living then you are to keep him with you helping him as you would a man from another country who is living among you
Lev  Take no interest from him in money or in goods but have the fear of your God before you and let your brother make a living among you
Lev  Do not take interest on the money which you let him have or on the food which you give him
Lev  I am the Lord your God who took you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan that I might be your God
Lev  And if your brother becomes poor and gives himself to you for money do not make use of him like a servant who is your property
Lev  But let him be with you as a servant working for payment till the year of Jubilee
Lev  Then he will go out from you he and his children with him and go back to his family and to the property of his fathers
Lev  For they are my servants whom I took out from the land of Egypt they may not become the property of another
Lev  Do not be a hard master to him but have the fear of God before you
Lev  But you may get servants as property from among the nations round about from them you may take menservants and womenservants
Lev  And in addition you may get for money servants from among the children of other nations who are living with you and from their families which have come to birth in your land and these will be your property
Lev  And they will be your childrens heritage after you to keep as their property they will be your servants for ever but you may not be hard masters to your countrymen the children of Israel
Lev  And if one from another nation living among you gets wealth and your countryman at his side becomes poor and gives himself for money to the man from another nation or to one of his family
Lev  After he has given himself he has the right to be made free for a price by one of his brothers
Lev  Or his fathers brother or the son of his fathers brother or any near relation or if he gets money he may make himself free
Lev  And let the years be numbered from the time when he gave himself to his owner till the year of Jubilee and the price given for him will be in relation to the number of years on the scale of the payment of a servant
Lev  If there is still a long time he will give back on account of it a part of the price which was given for him
Lev  And if there is only a short time he will take account of it with his master and in relation to the number of years he will give back the price of making him free
Lev  And he will be with him as a servant working for payment year by year his master is not to be cruel to him before your eyes
Lev  And if he is not made free in this way he will go out in the year of Jubilee he and his children with him
Lev  For the children of Israel are servants to me they are my servants whom I took out of the land of Egypt I am the Lord your God
Lev  Do not make images of false gods or put up an image cut in stone or a pillar or any pictured stone in your land to give worship to it for I am the Lord your God
Lev  Keep my Sabbaths and give honour to my holy place I am the Lord
Lev  If you are guided by my rules and keep my laws and do them
Lev  Then I will give you rain at the right time and the land will give her increase and the trees of the field will give their fruit
Lev  And the crushing of the grain will overtake the cutting of the grapes and the cutting of the grapes will overtake the planting of the seed and there will be bread in full measure and you will be living in your land safely
Lev  And I will give you peace in the land and you will take your rest and no one will give you cause for fear and I will put an end to all evil beasts in the land and no sword of war will go through your land
Lev  And you will put to flight those who are against you and they will be put to death by your swords
Lev  Then five of you will put to flight a hundred and a hundred of you will put to flight ten thousand and all who are against you will be put to death by your swords
Lev  And I will have pleasure in you and make you fertile and greater in number and I will keep my agreement with you
Lev  And old stores long kept will be your food and you will take out the old because of the new
Lev  And I will put my holy House among you and my soul will not be turned away from you in disgust
Lev  And I will be present among you and will be your God and you will be my people
Lev  I am the Lord your God who took you out of the land of Egypt so that you might not be servants to them by me the cords of your yoke were broken and I made you go upright
Lev  But if you do not give ear to me and do not keep all these my laws
Lev  And if you go against my rules and if you have hate in your souls for my decisions and you do not do all my orders but go against my agreement
Lev  This will I do to you I will put fear in your hearts even wasting disease and burning pain drying up the eyes and making the soul feeble and you will get no profit from your seed for your haters will take it for food
Lev  And my face will be turned from you and you will be broken before those who are against you and your haters will become your rulers and you will go in flight when no man comes after you
Lev  And if even after these things you will not give ear to me then I will send you punishment seven times more for your sins
Lev  And the pride of your strength will be broken and I will make your heaven as iron and your earth as brass
Lev  And your strength will be used up without profit for your land will not give her increase and the trees of the field will not give their fruit
Lev  And if you still go against me and will not give ear to me I will put seven times more punishments on you because of your sins
Lev  I will let loose the beasts of the field among you and they will take away your children and send destruction on your cattle so that your numbers will become small and your roads become waste
Lev  And if by these things you will not be turned to me but still go against me
Lev  Then I will go against you and I will give you punishment I myself seven times for all your sins
Lev  And I will send a sword on you to give effect to the punishment of my agreement and when you come together into your towns I will send disease among you and you will be given up into the hands of your haters
Lev  When I take away your bread of life ten women will be cooking bread in one oven and your bread will be measured out by weight you will have food but never enough
Lev  And if after all this you do not give ear to me but go against me still
Lev  Then my wrath will be burning against you and I will give you punishment I myself seven times for your sins
Lev  Then you will take the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters for food
Lev  And I will send destruction on your high places overturning your perfume altars and will put your dead bodies on your broken images and my soul will be turned from you in disgust
Lev  And I will make your towns waste and send destruction on your holy places I will take no pleasure in the smell of your sweet perfumes
Lev  And I will make your land a waste a wonder to your haters living in it
Lev  And I will send you out in all directions among the nations and my sword will be uncovered against you and your land will be without any living thing and your towns will be made waste
Lev  Then will the land take pleasure in its Sabbaths while it is waste and you are living in the land of your haters then will the land have rest
Lev  All the days while it is waste will the land have rest such rest as it never had in your Sabbaths when you were living in it
Lev  And as for the rest of you I will make their hearts feeble in the land of their haters and the sound of a leaf moved by the wind will send them in flight and they will go in flight as from the sword falling down when no one comes after them
Lev  Falling on one another as before the sword when no one comes after them you will give way before your haters
Lev  And death will overtake you among strange nations and the land of your haters will be your destruction
Lev  And those of you who are still living will be wasting away in their sins in the land of your haters in the sins of their fathers they will be wasting away
Lev  And they will have grief for their sins and for the sins of their fathers when their hearts were untrue to me and they went against me
Lev  So that I went against them and sent them away into the land of their haters if then the pride of their hearts is broken and they take the punishment of their sins
Lev  Then I will keep in mind the agreement which I made with Jacob and with Isaac and with Abraham and I will keep in mind the land
Lev  And the land while she is without them will keep her Sabbaths and they will undergo the punishment of their sins because they were turned away from my decisions and in their souls was hate for my laws
Lev  But for all that when they are in the land of their haters I will not let them go or be turned away from them or give them up completely my agreement with them will not be broken for I am the Lord their God
Lev  And because of them I will keep in mind the agreement which I made with their fathers whom I took out of the land of Egypt before the eyes of the nations to be their God I am the Lord
Lev  These are the rules decisions and laws which the Lord made between himself and the children of Israel in Mount Sinai by the hand of Moses
Lev  And the Lord said to Moses
Lev  Say to the children of Israel If a man makes a special oath you will give your decision as to the value of the persons for the Lord
Lev  And you will put the value of a male from twenty years to sixty years old at fifty shekels of silver by the scale of the holy place
Lev  And if it is a female the value will be thirty shekels
Lev  And if the person is from five to twenty years old the value will be twenty shekels for a male and ten for a female
Lev  And if the person is from one month to five years old then the value for a male will be five shekels of silver and for a female three shekels
Lev  And for sixty years old and over for a male the value will be fifteen shekels and for a female ten
Lev  But if he is poorer than the value which you have put on him then let him be taken to the priest and the priest will put a value on him such as it is possible for him to give
Lev  And if it is a beast of which men make offerings to the Lord whatever any man gives of such to the Lord will be holy
Lev  It may not be changed in any way a good given for a bad or a bad for a good if one beast is changed for another the two will be holy
Lev  And if it is any unclean beast of which offerings are not made to the Lord then let him take the beast before the priest
Lev  And let the priest put a value on it if it is good or bad whatever value the priest puts on it so will it be
Lev  But if he has a desire to get it back for himself let him give a fifth more than your value
Lev  And if a man has given his house as holy to the Lord then the priest will put a value on it if it is good or bad as the priest gives decision so will the value be fixed
Lev  And if the owner has a desire to get back his house let him give a fifth more than your value and it will be his
Lev  And if a man gives to the Lord part of the field which is his property then let your value be in relation to the seed which is planted in it a measure of barley grain will be valued at fifty shekels of silver
Lev  If he gives his field from the year of Jubilee the value will be fixed by your decision
Lev  But if he gives his field after the year of Jubilee the amount of the money will be worked out by the priest in relation to the number of years till the coming year of Jubilee and the necessary amount will be taken off your value
Lev  And if the man who has given the field has a desire to get it back let him give a fifth more than the price at which it was valued and it will be his
Lev  But if he has no desire to get it back or if he has given it for a price to another man it may not be got back again
Lev  But the field when it becomes free at the year of Jubilee will be holy to the Lord as a field given under oath it will be the property of the priest
Lev  And if a man gives to the Lord a field which he has got for money from another which is not part of his heritage
Lev  Then the value fixed by you up to the year of Jubilee will be worked out for him by the priest and in that day he will give the amount of your value as holy to the Lord
Lev  In the year of Jubilee the field will go back to him from whom he got it that is to him whose heritage it was
Lev  And let all your values be based on the shekel of the holy place that is twenty gerahs to the shekel
Lev  But a man may not give by oath to the Lord the firstfruits of cattle which are offered to the Lord if it is an ox or a sheep it is the Lords
Lev  And if it is an unclean beast then the owner of it may give money to get it back in agreement with the value fixed by you by giving a fifth more or if it is not taken back let it be given for money in agreement with your valuing
Lev  But nothing which a man has given completely to the Lord out of all his property of man or beast or of the land which is his heritage may be given away or got back in exchange for money anything completely given is most holy to the Lord
Lev  Any man given completely to the Lord may not be got back he is certainly to be put to death
Lev  And every tenth part of the land of the seed planted or of the fruit of trees is holy to the Lord
Lev  And if a man has a desire to get back any of the tenth part which he has given let him give a fifth more
Lev  And a tenth part of the herd and of the flock whatever goes under the rod of the valuer will be holy to the Lord
Lev  He may not make search to see if it is good or bad or make any changes in it and if he makes exchange of it for another the two will be holy he will not get them back again

Num  But the Levites of the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them
Num  For the Lord said to Moses

Num  But to them you are to give the care of the Tent of meeting with its vessels and everything in it they are to take up the Tent and be responsible for everything to do with it and put up their tents round it
Num  And when the Tent of meeting goes forward the Levites are to take it down and when it is to be put up they are to do it any strange person who comes near it is to be put to death
Num  The children of Israel are to put up their tents every man in his tentcircle round his flag
Num  But the tents of the Levites are to be round the Tent of meeting so that wrath may not come on the children of Israel the Tent of meeting is to be in the care of the Levites
Num  So the children of Israel did as the Lord had given orders to Moses
Num  And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron
Num  The children of Israel are to put up their tents in the order of their families by the flags of their fathers houses facing the Tent of meeting on every side

Num  But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel as the Lord said to Moses
Num  So the children of Israel did as the Lord said to Moses so they put up their tents by their flags and they went forward in the same order by their families and by their fathers houses
Num  Now these are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day when the word of the Lord came to Moses on Mount Sinai
Num  These are the names of the sons of Aaron Nadab the oldest and Abihu Eleazar and Ithamar
Num  These are the names of the sons of Aaron the priests on whom the holy oil was put who were marked out as priests
Num  And Nadab and Abihu were put to death before the Lord when they made an offering of strange fire before the Lord in the waste land of Sinai and they had no children and Eleazar and Ithamar did the work of priests before Aaron their father
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  Make the tribe of Levi come near and put them before Aaron the priest to be his helpers
Num  In order that they may be responsible to him and to all Israel for the care of the Tent of meeting and to do the work of the House
Num  And they will have the care of all the vessels of the Tent of meeting and will do for the children of Israel all the necessary work of the House
Num  Give the Levites to Aaron and his sons so that they may be his without question from among the children of Israel

Num  For all the first sons are mine on the day when I put to death all the first sons in the land of Egypt I took for myself every first male birth of man and beast They are mine I am the Lord
Num  And the Lord said to Moses in the waste land of Sinai
Num  Let all the children of Levi be numbered by their families and their fathers houses let every male of a month old and over be numbered
Num  So Moses did as the Lord said numbering them as he had been ordered
Num  These were the sons of Levi by name Gershon and Kohath and Merari
Num  And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families Libni and Shimei
Num  And the sons of Kohath by their families Amram and Izhar and Hebron and Uzziel
Num  And the sons of Merari by their families Mahli and Mushi These are the families of the Levites in the order of their fathers houses
Num  From Gershon come the Libnites and the Shimeites these are the families of the Gershonites
Num  Those who were numbered of them the males from one month old and over were seven thousand five hundred
Num  The tents of the Gershonites are to be placed at the back of the House to the west

Num  And in their care are to be all the boards of the Tent with their rods and pillars and bases and all the instruments and all they are used for
Num  And the pillars of the open space round it with their bases and nails and cords
Num  And those whose tents are to be placed on the east side of the House in front of the Tent of meeting looking to the dawn are Moses and Aaron and his sons who will do the work of the holy place for the children of Israel and any strange person who comes near will be put to death
Num  All the Levites numbered by Moses and Aaron at the order of the Lord all the males of one month old and over numbered in the order of their families were twentytwo thousand
Num  And the Lord said to Moses Let all the first male children be numbered and take the number of their names
Num  And give to me the Levites I am the Lord in place of the first sons of the children of Israel and the cattle of the Levites in place of the first births among the cattle of the children of Israel
Num  So Moses had all the first sons among the children of Israel numbered as the Lord said to him
Num  Every first son from a month old and over was numbered by name and the number came to twentytwo thousand two hundred and seventythree
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  Take the Levites in place of all the first sons of the children of Israel and the cattle of the Levites in place of their cattle the Levites are to be mine I am the Lord
Num  And the price you have to give for the two hundred and seventythree first sons of the children of Israel which are in addition to the number of the Levites
Num  Will be five shekels for every one by the scale of the holy place the shekel is twenty gerahs
Num  And this money the price of those over the number of the Levites is to be given to Aaron and his sons
Num  So Moses took the money the price of those whose place had not been taken by the Levites
Num  From the first sons of Israel he took it a thousand three hundred and sixtyfive shekels by the scale of the holy place
Num  And he gave the money to Aaron and his sons as the Lord had said
Num  And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron
Num  Let the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi be numbered by their families in the order of their fathers houses
Num  All those from thirty to fifty years old who are able to do the work of the Tent of meeting
Num  And this is to be the work of the sons of Kohath in connection with the most holy things
Num  When all the people go forward Aaron is to go in with his sons and take down the veil of the curtain covering the ark of witness with it
Num  And putting over it the leather cover and over that a blue cloth and putting its rods in place
Num  And on the table of the holy bread they are to put a blue cloth and on it all the vessels the spoons and the basins and the cups and the holy bread with them
Num  And over them they are to put a red cloth covering it with a leather cover and putting its rods in their places

Num  Placing on the cloth all its vessels the firebaskets the meathooks the spades and the basins all the vessels of the altar they are to put a leather cover over all these and put its rods in their places
Num  And after the holy place and all its vessels have been covered up by Aaron and his sons when the tents of the people go forward the sons of Kohath are to come and take it up but the holy things may not be touched by them for fear of death
Num  And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest is to be responsible for the oil for the light and the sweet perfumes for burning and the regular meal offering and the holy oil the House and the holy place and everything in it will be in his care
Num  And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron
Num  Do not let the family of the Kohathites be cut off from among the Levites
Num  But do this to them so that life and not death may be theirs when they come near the most holy things let Aaron and his sons go in and give to every one his work and that which he is to take up
Num  But they themselves are not to go in to see the holy place even for a minute for fear of death
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  Let the sons of Gershon be numbered by families in the order of their fathers houses
Num  All those from thirty to fifty years old who are able to do the work of the Tent of meeting
Num  This is to be the work of the Gershonites the things they are to do and take up
Num  They are to take up the curtains of the House and the Tent of meeting with its cover and the leather cover over it and the hangings for the door of the Tent of meeting
Num  And the hangings for the open space round the House and the altar and the curtain for its doorway with the cords and all the things used for them whatever is necessary for these they are to do
Num  From the mouth of Aaron and his sons the Gershonites will have word about all the things they are to do and take up you are to give them their orders
Num  This is the work of the family of the Gershonites in the Tent of meeting and they will be under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest
Num  The sons of Merari are to be numbered by families in the order of their fathers houses

Num  And the pillars of the open space outside it with their bases and their nails and cords and all the instruments used and everything which has to be done there all the instruments for which they are responsible are to be numbered by name
Num  This is the work which the sons of Merari are to do in connection with the Tent of meeting under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest
Num  So Moses and Aaron and the chiefs of the people took in hand the numbering of the sons of the Kohathites by families in the order of their fathers houses
Num  Numbering all those from thirty to fifty years old who were able to do the work in the Tent of meeting
Num  And the number of all these was two thousand seven hundred and fifty
Num  This is the number of those of the Kohathites who did the work in the Tent of meeting as they were numbered by Moses and Aaron at the order of the Lord
Num  And those of the sons of Gershon who were numbered by families
Num  All those from thirty to fifty years old who were able to do the work in the Tent of meeting

Num  This is the number of the sons of Gershon who did the work in the Tent of meeting as they were numbered by Moses and Aaron at the order of the Lord
Num  And those of the sons of Merari who were numbered by families in the order of their fathers houses
Num  All those from thirty to fifty years old who did the work in the Tent of meeting
Num  Who were numbered by families were three thousand two hundred
Num  This is the number of the sons of Merari numbered by Moses and Aaron at the order of the Lord
Num  And all the Levites who were numbered by Moses and Aaron and the chiefs of the people by families in the order of their fathers houses
Num  Those from thirty to fifty years old who were able to do the work of the Tent of meeting and of its transport
Num  Came to eight thousand five hundred and eighty
Num  At the order of the Lord they were numbered by Moses every one in relation to his work and to his part in the transport so they were numbered by Moses at the order of the Lord
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  Give orders to the children of Israel to put outside the tentcircle every leper and anyone who has any sort of flow from his body and anyone who is unclean from the touch of the dead
Num  Male or female they are to be put outside the tentcircle so that they may not make unclean my restingplace among them
Num  So the children of Israel did as the Lord had said to Moses and put them outside the tentcircle
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  Say to the children of Israel If a man or a woman does any of the sins of men going against the word of the Lord and is in the wrong
Num  Let them say openly what they have done and make payment for the wrong done with the addition of a fifth part and give it to him to whom the wrong was done
Num  But if the man has no relation to whom the payment may be made then the payment for sin made to the Lord will be the priests in addition to the sheep offered to take away his sin
Num  And every offering lifted up of all the holy things which the children of Israel give to the priest will be his
Num  And every mans holy things will be his whatever a man gives to the priest will be his
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  Say to the children of Israel If any mans wife does wrong sinning against him
Num  By taking as her lover another man and keeps it secret so that her husband has no knowledge of it and there is no witness against her and she is not taken in the act
Num  If the spirit of doubt comes into her husbands heart and he has doubts of his wife with good cause or if he has doubts of her without cause
Num  Then let him take her to the priest offering for her the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal without oil or perfume for it is a meal offering of a bitter spirit a meal offering keeping wrongdoing in mind
Num  And the priest will make her come near and put her before the Lord
Num  And the priest will take holy water in a pot and put in it dust from the floor of the House
Num  And he will make the woman come before the Lord with her hair loose and will put the meal offering the offering of a bitter spirit in her hands and the priest will take in his hand the bitter water causing the curse
Num  And he will make her take an oath and say to her If no man has been your lover and you have not been with another in place of your husband you are free from this bitter water causing the curse
Num  But if you have been with another in place of your husband and have made yourself unclean with a lover
Num  Then the priest will put the oath of the curse on the woman and say to her May the Lord make you a curse and an oath among your people sending on you wasting of the legs and disease of the stomach
Num  And this water of the curse will go into your body causing disease of your stomach and wasting of your legs and the woman will say So be it
Num  And the priest will put these curses in a book washing out the writing with the bitter water
Num  And he will give to the woman the bitter water for drink and the bitter water causing the curse will go into her
Num  And the priest will take from her hand the meal offering of doubt waving it before the Lord and will take it to the altar
Num  And he will take some of it in his hand burning it on the altar as a sign and then he will give the woman the bitter water
Num  And it will be that if the woman has become unclean sinning against her husband when she has taken the bitter water it will go into her body causing disease of the stomach and wasting of the legs and she will be a curse among her people
Num  But if she is clean she will be free and will have offspring
Num  This is the law for testing a wife who goes with another in place of her husband and becomes unclean
Num  Or for a husband who in a bitter spirit has doubts in his heart about his wife let him take her to the priest who will put in force this law
Num  Then the man will be free from all wrong and the womans sin will be on her
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  Say to the children of Israel If a man or a woman takes an oath to keep himself separate and give himself to the Lord
Num  He is to keep himself from wine and strong drink and take no mixed wine or strong drink or any drink made from grapes or any grapes green or dry
Num  All the time he is separate he may take nothing made from the grapevine from its seeds to its skin
Num  All the time he is under his oath let no blade come near his head till the days while he is separate are ended he is holy and his hair may not be cut
Num  All the time he is separate he may not come near any dead body
Num  He may not make himself unclean for his father or his mother his sister or his brother if death comes to them because he is under an oath to keep himself separate for God
Num  All the time he is separate he is holy to the Lord
Num  If death comes suddenly to a man at his side so that he becomes unclean let his hair be cut off on the day when he is made clean on the seventh day
Num  And on the eighth day let him take to the priest at the door of the Tent of meeting two doves or two young pigeons
Num  And the priest will give one for a sinoffering and the other for a burned offering to take away the sin which came on him on account of the dead and he will make his head holy that same day
Num  And he will give to the Lord his days of being separate offering a helamb of the first year as an offering for error but the earlier days will be a loss because he became unclean
Num  And this is the law for him who is separate when the necessary days are ended he is to come to the door of the Tent of meeting
Num  And make his offering to the Lord one helamb of the first year without a mark for a burned offering and one female lamb of the first year without a mark for a sinoffering and one male sheep without a mark for peaceofferings
Num  And a basket of unleavened bread cakes of the best meal mixed with oil and thin unleavened cakes covered with oil with their meal offering and drink offerings
Num  And the priest will take them before the Lord and make his sinoffering and his burned offering
Num  Giving the sheep of the peaceofferings with the basket of unleavened bread and at the same time the priest will make his meal offering and his drink offering
Num  Then let his long hair the sign of his oath be cut off at the door of the Tent of meeting and let him put it on the fire on which the peaceofferings are burning
Num  And the priest will take the cooked leg of the sheep and one unleavened cake and one thin cake out of the basket and put them on the hands of the separate one after his hair has been cut
Num  Waving them for a wave offering before the Lord this is holy for the priest together with the waved breast and the leg which is lifted up after that the man may take wine
Num  This is the law for him who takes an oath to keep himself separate and for his offering to the Lord on that account in addition to what he may be able to get this is the law of his oath which he will have to keep
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  Say to Aaron and his sons These are the words of blessing which are to be used by you in blessing the children of Israel say to them
Num  May the Lord send his blessing on you and keep you
Num  May the light of the Lords face be shining on you in grace
Num  May the Lords approval be resting on you and may he give you peace
Num  So they will put my name on the children of Israel and I will give them my blessing
Num  And when Moses had put up the House completely and had put oil on it and made it holy with all the things in it and had made the altar and all its vessels holy with oil
Num  Then the chiefs of Israel the heads of their fathers houses made offerings these were the chiefs of the tribes who were over those who were numbered
Num  And they came with their offerings before the Lord six covered carts and twelve oxen a cart for every two of the chiefs and for every one an ox
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  Take the things from them to be used for the work of the Tent of meeting and give them to the Levites to every man what is needed for his work
Num  So Moses took the carts and the oxen and gave them to the Levites
Num  Two carts and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon for their work
Num  And four carts and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari for their work under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest
Num  But to the sons of Kohath he gave nothing because they had the care of the holy place taking it about on their backs

Num  And for the peaceofferings two oxen five male sheep five hegoats five helambs of the first year this was the offering of Ahira the son of Enan
Num  These were the offerings given for the altar by the chiefs of Israel when the holy oil was put on it twelve silver plates twelve silver basins twelve gold spoons
Num  The weight of every silver plate was a hundred and thirty shekels and of every basin seventy the weight of all the silver of the vessels was two thousand and four hundred shekels by the scale of the holy place
Num  The weight of the twelve gold spoons of spice for burning was ten shekels for every one by the scale of the holy place all the gold of the spoons was a hundred and twenty shekels
Num  All the oxen for the burned offering were twelve the male sheep twelve the helambs of the first year twelve with their meal offering and the males of the goats for sinoffering twelve
Num  And all the oxen for the peaceofferings twentyfour oxen the male sheep sixty and the hegoats sixty the helambs of the first year sixty This was given for the altar after the holy oil was put on it
Num  And when Moses went into the Tent of meeting to have talk with him then the Voice came to his ears from over the cover which was on the ark of witness from between the two winged ones And he had talk with him
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  Say to Aaron When you put the lights in their places the seven lights will give light in front of the support
Num  And Aaron did so he put the lights in their places so that they gave light in front of the support as the Lord gave orders to Moses
Num  The support for the lights was of hammered gold work from its base to its flowers it was of hammered work from the design which the Lord had given to Moses he made the support for the lights
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  Take the Levites out from among the children of Israel and make them clean
Num  And this is how you are to make them clean let the holy water which takes away sin be put on them and let the hair all over their bodies be cut off with a sharp blade and let their clothing be washed and their bodies made clean
Num  Then let them take a young ox and its meal offering crushed grain mixed with oil and take another ox for a sinoffering
Num  And make the Levites come forward in front of the Tent of meeting and let all the children of Israel come together
Num  And you are to take the Levites before the Lord and the children of Israel are to put their hands on them
Num  And Aaron is to give the Levites to the Lord as a wave offering from the children of Israel so that they may do the Lords work
Num  And the Levites are to put their hands on the heads of the oxen and one of the oxen is to be offered for a sinoffering and the other for a burned offering to the Lord to take away the sin of the Levites
Num  Then the Levites are to be put before Aaron and his sons to be offered as a wave offering to the Lord
Num  So you are to make the Levites separate from the children of Israel and the Levites will be mine
Num  After that the Levites will go in to do whatever has to be done in the Tent of meeting you are to make them clean and give them as a wave offering
Num  For they have been given to me from among the children of Israel in place of every mothers first son the first to come to birth in Israel I have taken them for myself
Num  For every mothers first son among the children of Israel is mine the first male birth of man or beast on the day when I sent death on all the first sons in the land of Egypt I made them mine
Num  And in place of the first sons among the children of Israel I have taken the Levites
Num  And I have given them to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel to undertake for them all the work of the Tent of meeting and to take away sin from the children of Israel so that no evil may come on them when they come near the holy place
Num  All these things Moses and Aaron and the children of Israel did to the Levites as the Lord gave orders to Moses about the Levites so the children of Israel did
Num  And the Levites were made clean from sin and their clothing was washed and Aaron gave them for a wave offering before the Lord and Aaron took away their sin and made them clean
Num  And then the Levites went in to do their work in the Tent of meeting before Aaron and his sons all the orders which the Lord had given Moses about the Levites were put into effect
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  This is the rule for the Levites those of twentyfive years old and over are to go in and do the work of the Tent of meeting
Num  But after they are fifty years old they are to give up their work and do no more
Num  But be with their brothers in the Tent of meeting taking care of it but doing no work This is what you are to do in connection with the Levites and their work
Num  And the Lord said to Moses in the waste land of Sinai in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt
Num  Let the children of Israel keep the Passover at its regular time
Num  In the fourteenth day of this month at evening you are to keep it at the regular time and in the way ordered in the law
Num  And Moses gave orders to the children of Israel to keep the Passover
Num  So they kept the Passover in the first month on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the waste land of Sinai as the Lord gave orders to Moses so the children of Israel did
Num  And there were certain men who were unclean because of a dead body so that they were not able to keep the Passover on that day and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day
Num  And these men said to him We have been made unclean by the dead body of a man why may we not make the offering of the Lord at the regular time among the children of Israel
Num  And Moses said to them Do nothing till the Lord gives me directions about you
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  Say to the children of Israel If any one of you or of your families is unclean because of a dead body or is on a journey far away still he is to keep the Passover to the Lord
Num  In the second month on the fourteenth day in the evening they are to keep it taking it with unleavened bread and bittertasting plants
Num  Nothing of it is to be kept till the morning and no bone of it is to be broken they are to keep it by the rules of the Passover
Num  But the man who not being unclean or on a journey does not keep the Passover will be cut off from his people because he did not make the offering of the Lord at the regular time his sin will be on him
Num  And if a man from another country is among you and has a desire to keep the Passover to the Lord let him do as is ordered in the law of the Passover there is to be the same rule for the man from another nation and for him who had his birth in the land
Num  And on the day when the House was put up the cloud came down on it on the Tent of witness and in the evening there was a light like fire over the House till the morning
Num  And so it was at all times it was covered by the cloud and by a light as of fire by night
Num  And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the House then the children of Israel went journeying on and in the place where the cloud came to rest there the children of Israel put up their tents
Num  At the order of the Lord the children of Israel went forward and at the order of the Lord they put up their tents as long as the cloud was resting on the House they did not go away from that place
Num  When the cloud was resting on the House for a long time the children of Israel waiting for the order of the Lord did not go on
Num  Sometimes the cloud was resting on the House for two or three days then by the order of the Lord they kept their tents in that place and when the Lord gave the order they went on
Num  And sometimes the cloud was there only from evening to morning and when the cloud was taken up in the morning they went on their journey again or if it was resting there by day and by night whenever the cloud was taken up they went forward
Num  Or if the cloud came to rest on the House for two days or a month or a year without moving the children of Israel went on waiting there and did not go on but whenever it was taken up they went forward on their journey
Num  At the word of the Lord they put up their tents and at the word of the Lord they went forward on their journey they kept the orders of the Lord as he gave them by Moses
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  Make two silver horns of hammered work to be used for getting the people together and to give the sign for the moving of the tents
Num  When they are sounded all the people are to come together to you at the door of the Tent of meeting
Num  If only one of them is sounded then the chiefs the heads of the thousands of Israel are to come to you
Num  When a loud note is sounded the tents placed on the east side are to go forward
Num  At the sound of a second loud note the tents on the south side are to go forward the loud note will be the sign to go forward
Num  But when all the people are to come together the horn is to be sounded but not loudly
Num  The horns are to be sounded by the sons of Aaron the priests this is to be a law for you for ever from generation to generation
Num  And if you go to war in your land against any who do you wrong then let the loud note of the horn be sounded and the Lord your God will keep you in mind and give you salvation from those who are against you
Num  And on days of joy and on your regular feasts and on the first day of every month let the horns be sounded over your burned offerings and your peaceofferings and they will put the Lord in mind of you I am the Lord your God
Num  Now in the second year on the twentieth day of the second month the cloud was taken up from over the Tent of witness
Num  And the children of Israel went on their journey out of the waste land of Sinai and the cloud came to rest in the waste land of Paran
Num  They went forward for the first time on their journey as the Lord had given orders by the hand of Moses
Num  First the flag of the children of Judah went forward with their armies and at the head of his army was Nahshon the son of Amminadab
Num  And at the head of the army of the children of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar
Num  And at the head of the army of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon
Num  Then the House was taken down and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari who were responsible for moving the House went forward
Num  Then the flag of the children of Reuben went forward with their armies and at the head of his army was Elizur the son of Shedeur
Num  And at the head of the army of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai
Num  At the head of the army of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Reuel
Num  Then the Kohathites went forward with the holy place the others put up the House ready for their coming
Num  Then the flag of the children of Ephraim went forward with their armies and at the head of his army was Elishama the son of Ammihud
Num  At the head of the army of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur
Num  At the head of the army of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni
Num  And the flag of the children of Dan whose tents were moved last of all went forward with their armies and at the head of his army was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai
Num  At the head of the army of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ochran
Num  And at the head of the army of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan
Num  This was the order in which the children of Israel were journeying by armies so they went forward
Num  Then Moses said to Hobab the son of his fatherinlaw Reuel the Midianite We are journeying to that place of which the Lord has said I will give it to you so come with us and it will be for your profit for the Lord has good things in store for Israel
Num  But he said I will not go with you I will go back to the land of my birth and to my relations
Num  And he said Do not go from us for you will be eyes for us guiding us to the right places in the waste land to put up our tents
Num  And if you come with us we will give you a part in whatever good the Lord does for us
Num  So they went forward three days journey from the mountain of the Lord and the ark of the Lords agreement went three days journey before them looking for a restingplace for them
Num  And by day the cloud of the Lord went over them when they went forward from the place where they had put up their tents
Num  And when the ark went forward Moses said Come up O Lord and let the armies of those who are against you be broken and let your haters go in flight before you
Num  And when it came to rest he said Take rest O Lord and give a blessing to the families of Israel
Num  Now the people were saying evil against the Lord and the Lord hearing it was angry and sent fire on them burning the outer parts of the tentcircle
Num  And the people made an outcry to Moses and Moses made prayer to the Lord and the fire was stopped
Num  So that place was named Taberah because of the fire of the Lord which had been burning among them
Num  And the mixed band of people who went with them were overcome by desire and the children of Israel weeping again said Who will give us flesh for our food
Num  Sweet is the memory of the fish we had in Egypt for nothing and the fruit and green plants of every sort sharp and pleasing to the taste
Num  But now our soul is wasted away there is nothing at all we have nothing but this manna before our eyes
Num  Now the manna was like a seed of grain like small clear drops
Num  The people went about taking it up from the earth crushing it between stones or hammering it to powder and boiling it in pots and they made cakes of it its taste was like the taste of cakes cooked with oil
Num  When the dew came down on the tents at night the manna came down with it
Num  And at the sound of the people weeping every man at his tentdoor the wrath of the Lord was great and Moses was very angry
Num  And Moses said to the Lord Why have you done me this evil and why have I not grace in your eyes that you have put on me the care of all this people
Num  Am I the father of all this people have I given them birth that you say to me Take them in your arms like a child at the breast to the land which you gave by an oath to their fathers
Num  Where am I to get flesh to give to all this people For they are weeping to me and saying Give us flesh for our food
Num  I am not able by myself to take the weight of all this people for it is more than my strength
Num  If this is to be my fate put me to death now in answer to my prayer if I have grace in your eyes and let me not see my shame
Num  And the Lord said to Moses Send for seventy of the responsible men of Israel who are in your opinion men of weight and authority over the people make them come to the Tent of meeting and be there with you
Num  And I will come down and have talk with you there and I will take some of the spirit which is on you and put it on them and they will take part of the weight of the people off you so that you do not have to take it by yourself
Num  And say to the people Make yourselves clean before tomorrow and you will have flesh for your food for in the ears of the Lord you have been weeping and saying Who will give us flesh for food for we were well off in Egypt and so the Lord will give you flesh and it will be your food
Num  Not for one day only or even for five or ten or twenty days
Num  But every day for a month till you are tired of it turning from it in disgust because you have gone against the Lord who is with you and have been weeping before him saying Why did we come out of Egypt
Num  Then Moses said The people among whom I am are six hundred thousand men on foot and you have said I will give them flesh to be their food for a month
Num  Are flocks and herds to be put to death for them or are all the fish in the sea to be got together so that they may be full
Num  And the Lord said to Moses Has the Lords hand become short Now you will see if my word comes true for you or not
Num  And Moses went out and gave the people the words of the Lord and he took seventy of the responsible men of the people placing them round the Tent
Num  Then the Lord came down in the cloud and had talk with him and put on the seventy men some of the spirit which was on him now when the spirit came to rest on them they were like prophets but only at that time
Num  But two men were still in the tentcircle one of them named Eldad and the other Medad and the spirit came to rest on them they were among those who had been sent for but they had not gone out to the Tent and the prophets power came on them in the tentcircle
Num  And a young man went running to Moses and said Eldad and Medad are acting as prophets in the tentcircle
Num  Then Joshua the son of Nun who had been Moses servant from the time when he was a child said My lord Moses let them be stopped
Num  And Moses said to him Are you moved by envy on my account If only all the Lords people were prophets and the Lord might put his spirit on them
Num  Then Moses with the responsible men of Israel went back to the tentcircle
Num  Then the Lord sent a wind driving little birds from the sea so that they came down on the tents and all round the tentcircle about a days journey on this side and on that in masses about two cubits high over the face of the earth
Num  And all that day and all night and the day after the people were taking up the birds the smallest amount which anyone got was ten homers and they put them out all round the tents
Num  But while the meat was still between their teeth before it was tasted the wrath of the Lord was moved against the people and he sent a great outburst of disease on them
Num  So that place was named Kibrothhattaavah because there they put in the earth the bodies of the people who had given way to their desires
Num  From Kibrothhattaavah the people went on to Hazeroth and there they put up their tents
Num  Now Miriam and Aaron said evil against Moses because of the Cushite woman to whom he was married for he had taken a Cushite woman as his wife
Num  And they said Have the words of the Lord been given to Moses only have they not come to us And the Lord took note of it
Num  Now the man Moses was more gentle than any other man on earth
Num  And suddenly the Lord said to Moses and Aaron and Miriam Come out you three to the Tent of meeting And the three of them went out
Num  And the Lord came down in a pillar of cloud taking his place at the door of the Tent and made Aaron and Miriam come before him
Num  And he said Now give ear to my words if there is a prophet among you I will give him knowledge of myself in a vision and will let my words come to him in a dream
Num  My servant Moses is not so he is true to me in all my house
Num  With him I will have talk mouth to mouth openly and not in dark sayings and with his eyes he will see the form of the Lord why then had you no fear of saying evil against my servant Moses
Num  And burning with wrath against them the Lord went away
Num  And the cloud was moved from over the Tent and straight away Miriam became a leper as white as snow and Aaron looking at Miriam saw that she was a leper
Num  Then Aaron said to Moses O my lord let not our sin be on our heads for we have done foolishly and are sinners
Num  Let her not be as one dead whose flesh is half wasted when he comes out from the body of his mother
Num  And Moses crying to the Lord said Let my prayer come before you O God and make her well
Num  And the Lord said to Moses If her father had put a mark of shame on her would she not be shamed for seven days Let her be shut up outside the tentcircle for seven days and after that she may come in again
Num  So Miriam was shut up outside the tentcircle for seven days and the people did not go forward on their journey till Miriam had come in again
Num  After that the people went on from Hazeroth and put up their tents in the waste land of Paran
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  Send men to get knowledge about the land of Canaan which I am giving to the children of Israel from every tribe of their fathers you are to send a man every one a chief among them
Num  And Moses sent them from the waste land of Paran as the Lord gave orders all of them men who were heads of the children of Israel
Num  And these were their names of the tribe of Reuben Shammua the son of Zaccur
Num  Of the tribe of Simeon Shaphat the son of Hori
Num  Of the tribe of Judah Caleb the son of Jephunneh
Num  Of the tribe of Issachar Igal the son of Joseph
Num  Of the tribe of Ephraim Hoshea the son of Nun
Num  Of the tribe of Benjamin Palti the son of Raphu
Num  Of the tribe of Zebulun Gaddiel the son of Sodi
Num  Of the tribe of Joseph that is of the family of Manasseh Gaddi the son of Susi
Num  Of the tribe of Dan Ammiel the son of Gemalli
Num  Of the tribe of Asher Sethur the son of Michael
Num  Of the tribe of Naphtali Nahbi the son of Vophsi
Num  Of the tribe of Gad Gevel the son of Machi
Num  These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to get knowledge about the land And Moses gave to Hoshea the son of Nun the name of Joshua
Num  So Moses sent them to have a look at the land of Canaan and said to them Go up into the South and into the hillcountry
Num  And see what the land is like and if the people living in it are strong or feeble small or great in number
Num  And what sort of land they are living in if it is good or bad and what their livingplaces are tentcircles or walled towns
Num  And if the land is fertile or poor and if there is wood in it or not And be of good heart and come back with some of the produce of the land Now it was the time when the first grapes were ready
Num  So they went up and got a view of the land from the waste land of Zin to Rehob on the way to Hamath
Num  They went up into the South and came to Hebron and Ahiman and Sheshai and Talmai the children of Anak were living there Now the building of Hebron took place seven years before that of Zoan in Egypt
Num  And they came to the valley of Eshcol and cutting down a vinebranch with its grapes two of them took it on a rod between them and they took some pomegranates and figs
Num  That place was named the valley of Eshcol because of the grapes which the children of Israel took from there
Num  At the end of forty days they came back from viewing the land
Num  And they came back to Moses and Aaron and all the children of Israel to Kadesh in the waste land of Paran and gave an account to them and to all the people and let them see the produce of the land
Num  And they said We came to the land where you sent us and truly it is flowing with milk and honey and here is some of the produce of it
Num  But the people living in the land are strong and the towns are walled and very great further we saw the children of Anak there
Num  And the Amalekites are in the South and the Hittites and the Jebusites and the Amorites are living in the hillcountry and the Canaanites by the sea and by the side of Jordan
Num  Then Caleb made signs to the people to keep quiet and said to Moses Let us go up straight away and take this land for we are well able to overcome it
Num  But the men who had gone up with him said We are not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we
Num  And they gave the children of Israel a bad account of the land they had been to see saying This land through which we went is a land causing destruction to those living in it and all the people we saw there are men of more than common size
Num  There we saw those great men the sons of Anak offspring of the Nephilim and we seemed to ourselves no more than insects and so we seemed to them
Num  Then all the people gave load cries of grief and all that night they gave themselves up to weeping
Num  And all the children of Israel crying out against Moses and Aaron said If only we had come to our death in the land of Egypt or even in this waste land
Num  Why is the Lord taking us into this land to come to our death by the sword Our wives and our little ones will get into strange hands would it not be better for us to go back to Egypt
Num  And they said to one another Let us make a captain over us and go back to Egypt
Num  Then Moses and Aaron went down on their faces before the meeting of the people
Num  And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh two of those who had been to see the land giving signs of grief
Num  Said to all the children of Israel This land which we went through to see is a very good land
Num  And if the Lord has delight in us he will take us into this land and give it to us a land flowing with milk and honey
Num  Only do not go against the Lord or go in fear of the people of the land for they will be our food their strength has been taken from them and the Lord is with us have no fear of them
Num  But all the people said they were to be stoned Then the glory of the Lord was seen in the Tent of meeting before the eyes of all the children of Israel
Num  And the Lord said to Moses How long will this people have no respect for me how long will they be without faith in the face of all the signs I have done among them
Num  I will send disease on them for their destruction and take away their heritage and I will make of you a nation greater and stronger than they
Num  And Moses said to the Lord Then it will come to the ears of the Egyptians for by your power you took this people out from among them
Num  And they will give the news to the people of this land they have had word that you Lord are present with this people letting yourself be seen face to face and that your cloud is resting over them and that you go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night
Num  Now if you put to death all this people as one man then the nations who have had word of your glory will say
Num  Because the Lord was not able to take this people into the land which he made an oath to give them he sent destruction on them in the waste land
Num  So now may my prayer come before you and let the power of the Lord be great as you said
Num  The Lord is slow to wrath and great in mercy overlooking wrongdoing and evil and will not let wrongdoers go free sending punishment on children for the sins of their fathers to the third and fourth generation
Num  May the sin of this people have forgiveness in the measure of your great mercy as you have had mercy on them from Egypt up till now
Num  And the Lord said I have had mercy as you say
Num  But truly as I am living and as all the earth will be full of the glory of the Lord
Num  Because all these men having seen my glory and the signs which I have done in Egypt and in the waste land still have put me to the test ten times and have not given ear to my voice
Num  They will not see the land about which I made an oath to their fathers not one of these by whom I have not been honoured will see it
Num  But my servant Caleb because he had a different spirit in him and has been true to me with all his heart him I will take into that land into which he went and his seed will have it for their heritage
Num  Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites are in the valley tomorrow turning round go into the waste land by the way to the Red Sea
Num  Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron
Num  How long am I to put up with this evil people and their outcries against me The words which they say against me have come to my ears
Num  Say to them By my life says the Lord as certainly as your words have come to my ears so certainly will I do this to you
Num  Your dead bodies will be stretched out in this waste land and of all your number all those of twenty years old and over who have been crying out against me
Num  Not one will come into the land which I gave my word you would have for your restingplace but only Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun
Num  And your little ones whom you said would come into strange hands I will take in and they will see the land which you would not have
Num  But as for you your dead bodies will be stretched in this waste land
Num  And your children will be wanderers in the waste land for forty years undergoing punishment for your false ways till your bodies become dust in the waste land
Num  And as you went through the land viewing it for forty days so for forty years a year for every day you will undergo punishment for your wrongdoing and you will see that I am against you
Num  I the Lord have said it and this I will certainly do to all this evil people who have come together against me in this waste land destruction will come on them and death will be their fate
Num  And the men whom Moses sent to see the land and who by the bad account they gave of the land were the cause of the outcry the people made against Moses
Num  Those same men who said evil of the land came to their death by disease before the Lord
Num  But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh of those who went to see the land were not touched by disease
Num  And when Moses put these words before the children of Israel the people were full of grief
Num  And early in the morning they got up and went to the top of the mountain saying We are here and we will go up to the place which the Lord said he would give us for we have done wrong
Num  And Moses said Why are you now acting against the Lords order seeing that no good will come of it
Num  Go not up for the Lord is not with you and you will be overcome by those who are fighting against you
Num  For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you and you will be put to death by their swords because you have gone back from the way of the Lord the Lord will not be with you
Num  But they gave no attention to his words and went to the top of the mountain though Moses and the ark of the Lords agreement did not go out of the tentcircle
Num  Then the Amalekites came down and the Canaanites who were living in the hillcountry and overcame them completely driving them back as far as Hormah
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  Say to the children of Israel When you have come into the land which I am giving to you for your restingplace
Num  And are going to make an offering by fire to the Lord a burned offering or an offering in connection with an oath or an offering freely given or at your regular feasts an offering for a sweet smell to the Lord from the herd or the flock
Num  Then let him who is making his offering give to the Lord a meal offering of a tenth part of a measure of the best meal mixed with a fourth part of a hin of oil
Num  And for the drink offering you are to give with the burned offering or other offering the fourth part of a hin of wine for every lamb
Num  Or for a male sheep give as a meal offering two tenth parts of a measure of the best meal mixed with a third part of a hin of oil
Num  And for the drink offering give a third part of a hin of wine for a sweet smell to the Lord
Num  And when you make ready a young ox for a burned or other offering or for the effecting of an oath or for peaceofferings to the Lord
Num  Then with the ox give a meal offering of three tenth parts of a measure of the best meal mixed with half a hin of oil
Num  And for the drink offering give half a hin of wine for an offering made by fire for a sweet smell to the Lord
Num  This is to be done for every young ox and for every male sheep or helamb or young goat
Num  Whatever number you make ready so you are to do for every one
Num  All those who are Israelites by birth are to do these things in this way when giving an offering made by fire of a sweet smell to the Lord
Num  And if a man from another country or any other person living among you through all your generations has the desire to give an offering made by fire of a sweet smell to the Lord let him do as you do
Num  There is to be one law for you and for the man of another country living with you one law for ever from generation to generation as you are so is he to be before the Lord
Num  The law and the rule are to be the same for you and for those from other lands living with you
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  Say to the children of Israel When you come into the land where I am guiding you
Num  Then when you take for your food the produce of the land you are to give an offering lifted up before the Lord
Num  Of the first of your rough meal you are to give a cake for a lifted offering lifting it up before the Lord as the offering of the grainfloor is lifted up
Num  From generation to generation you are to give to the Lord a lifted offering from the first of your rough meal
Num  And if in error you go against any of these laws which the Lord has given to Moses
Num  All the laws which the Lord has given you by the hand of Moses from the day when the Lord gave them and ever after from generation to generation
Num  Then if the wrong is done in error without the knowledge of the meeting of the people let all the meeting give a young ox as a burned offering a sweet smell to the Lord with its meal offering and its drink offering as is ordered in the law together with a hegoat for a sinoffering
Num  So the priest will make the people free from sin and they will have forgiveness for it was an error and they have given their offering made by fire to the Lord and their sinoffering before the Lord on account of their error
Num  And all the meeting of the children of Israel as well as those from other lands living among them will have forgiveness for it was an error on the part of the people
Num  And if one person does wrong without being conscious of it then let him give a shegoat of the first year for a sinoffering
Num  And the priest will take away the sin of the person who has done wrong if the wrong was done unconsciously and he will have forgiveness
Num  The law in connection with wrong done unconsciously is to be the same for him who is an Israelite by birth and for the man from another country who is living among them
Num  But the person who does wrong in the pride of his heart if he is one of you or of another nation by birth is acting without respect for the Lord and will be cut off from his people
Num  Because he had no respect for the word of the Lord and did not keep his law that man will be cut off without mercy and his sin will be on him
Num  Now while the children of Israel were in the waste land they saw a man who was getting sticks on the Sabbath day
Num  And those who saw him getting sticks took him before Moses and Aaron and all the people
Num  And they had him shut up because they had no directions about what was to be done with him
Num  Then the Lord said to Moses Certainly the man is to be put to death let him be stoned by all the people outside the tentcircle
Num  So all the people took him outside the tentcircle and he was stoned to death there as the Lord gave orders to Moses
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  Say to the children of Israel that through all their generations they are to put on the edges of their robes an ornament of twisted threads and in every ornament a blue cord
Num  So that looking on these ornaments you may keep in mind the orders of the Lord and do them and not be guided by the desires of your hearts and eyes through which you have been untrue to me
Num  And that you may keep in mind all my orders and do them and be holy to your God
Num  I am the Lord your God who took you out of the land of Egypt so that I might be your God I am the Lord your God
Num  Now Korah the son of Izhar the son of Kohath the son of Levi with Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab and On the son of Pallu the son of Reuben made themselves ready
Num  And came before Moses with certain of the children of Israel two hundred and fifty chiefs of the people men of good name who had a place in the meeting of the people
Num  They came together against Moses and against Aaron and said to them You take overmuch on yourselves seeing that all the people are holy every one of them and the Lord is among them why then have you put yourselves in authority over the people of the Lord
Num  And Moses hearing this went down on his face
Num  And he said to Korah and his band In the morning the Lord will make clear who are his and who is holy and who may come near him the man of his selection will be caused to come near him
Num  So do this let Korah and all his band take vessels for burning perfumes
Num  And put spices on the fire in them before the Lord tomorrow then the man marked out by the Lord will be holy you take overmuch on yourselves you sons of Levi
Num  And Moses said to Korah Give ear now you sons of Levi
Num  Does it seem only a small thing to you that the God of Israel has made you separate from the rest of Israel letting you come near himself to do the work of the House of the Lord and to take your place before the people to do what has to be done for them
Num  Letting you and all your brothers the sons of Levi come near to him and would you now be priests
Num  So you and all your band have come together against the Lord and Aaron who is he that you are crying out against him
Num  Then Moses sent for Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab and they said We will not come up
Num  Is it not enough that you have taken us from a land flowing with milk and honey to put us to death in the waste land but now you are desiring to make yourself a chief over us
Num  And more than this you have not taken us into a land flowing with milk and honey or given us a heritage of fields and vinegardens will you put out the eyes of these men We will not come up
Num  Then Moses was very angry and said to the Lord Give no attention to their offering not one of their asses have I taken or done wrong to any of them
Num  And Moses said to Korah You and all your band are to come before the Lord tomorrow you and they and Aaron
Num  And let every man take a vessel for burning perfumes and put sweet spices in them let every man take his vessel before the Lord two hundred and fifty vessels you and Aaron and everyone with his vessel
Num  So every man took his vessel and they put fire in them with spices and came to the door of the Tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron
Num  And Korah made all the people come together against them to the door of the Tent of meeting and the glory of the Lord was seen by all the people
Num  And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron
Num  Come out from among this people so that I may send sudden destruction on them
Num  Then falling down on their faces they said O God the God of the spirits of all flesh because of one mans sin will your wrath be moved against all the people
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  Say to the people Come away from the tent of Korah Dathan and Abiram
Num  So Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram and the responsible men of Israel went with him
Num  And he said to the people Come away now from the tents of these evil men without touching anything of theirs or you may be taken in the punishment of their sins
Num  So on every side they went away from the tent of Korah Dathan and Abiram and Dathan and Abiram came out to the door of their tents with their wives and their sons and their little ones
Num  And Moses said Now you will see that the Lord has sent me to do all these works and I have not done them of myself
Num  If these men have the common death of men or if the natural fate of all men overtakes them then the Lord has not sent me
Num  But if the Lord does something new opening the earth to take them in with everything which is theirs and they go down living into the underworld then it will be clear to you that the Lord has not been honoured by these men
Num  And while these words were on his lips the earth under them was parted in two
Num  And the earth opening her mouth took them in with their families and all the men who were joined to Korah and their goods
Num  So they and all theirs went down living into the underworld and the earth was shut over them and they were cut off from among the meeting of the people
Num  And all Israel round about them went in flight at their cry For fear said they that we go down into the heart of the earth
Num  Then fire came out from the Lord burning up the two hundred and fifty men who were offering the perfume
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  Say to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest that he is to take out of the flames the vessels with the perfumes in them turning the fire out of them for they are holy
Num  And let the vessels of those men who with their lives have made payment for their sin be hammered out into plates as a cover for the altar for they have been offered before the Lord and are holy so that they may be a sign to the children of Israel
Num  So Eleazar the priest took the brass vessels which had been offered by those who were burned up and they were hammered out to make a cover for the altar
Num  To be a sign kept in memory for ever by the children of Israel that no man who is not of the seed of Aaron has the right of burning spices before the Lord so that he may not be like Korah and his band as the Lord said to him by the mouth of Moses
Num  But on the day after all the children of Israel made an outcry against Moses and against Aaron saying You have put to death the Lords people
Num  Now when the people had come together against Moses and Aaron looking in the direction of the Tent of meeting they saw the cloud covering it and the glory of the Lord came before their eyes
Num  Then Moses and Aaron came to the front of the Tent of meeting
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  Come out from among this people so that I may send sudden destruction on them And they went down on their faces
Num  And Moses said to Aaron Take your vessel and put in it fire from the altar and sweet spices and take it quickly into the meeting of the people and make them free from sin for wrath has gone out from the Lord and the disease is starting
Num  And at the words of Moses Aaron took his vessel and went running among the people and even then the disease had made a start among them and he put spices in his vessel to take away the sin of the people
Num  And he took his place between the dead and the living and the disease was stopped
Num  Now fourteen thousand seven hundred deaths were caused by that disease in addition to those who came to their end because of what Korah had done
Num  Then Aaron went back to Moses to the door of the Tent of meeting and the disease came to a stop
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  Say to the children of Israel that they are to give you rods one for every family for every chief the head of his fathers house making twelve rods let every mans name be placed on his rod
Num  And let Aarons name be placed on the rod of Levi for there is to be one rod for the head of every family
Num  And let them be stored up in the Tent of meeting in front of the ark of witness where I come to you
Num  And the rod of that man who is marked out by me for myself will have buds on it so I will put a stop to the outcries which the children of Israel make to me against you
Num  So Moses gave these orders to the children of Israel and all their chiefs gave him rods one for the head of every family making twelve rods and Aarons rod was among them
Num  And Moses put the rods before the Lord in the Tent of witness
Num  Now on the day after Moses went into the Tent of witness and he saw that Aarons rod the rod of the house of Levi had put out buds and was covered with buds and flowers and fruit
Num  Then Moses took out all the rods from before the Lord and gave them back to the children of Israel and they saw them and every man took his rod
Num  And the Lord said to Moses Put Aarons rod back in front of the ark of witness to be kept for a sign against this falsehearted people so that you may put a stop to their outcries against me and death may not overtake them
Num  This Moses did as the Lord gave orders so he did
Num  And the children of Israel said to Moses Truly destruction has come on us an evil fate has overtaken us all
Num  Death will overtake everyone who comes near who comes near the House of the Lord are we all to come to destruction
Num  And the Lord said to Aaron You and your sons and your fathers family are to be responsible for all wrongdoing in relation to the holy place and you and your sons are to be responsible for the errors which come about in your work as priests
Num  Let your brothers the family of Levi come near with you so that they may be joined with you and be your servants but you and your sons with you are to go in before the ark of witness
Num  They are to do your orders and be responsible for the work of the Tent but they may not come near the vessels of the holy place or the altar so that death may not overtake them or you
Num  They are to be joined with you in the care of the Tent of meeting doing whatever is needed for the Tent and no one of any other family may come near you
Num  You are to be responsible for the holy place and the altar so that wrath may never again come on the children of Israel
Num  Now see I have taken your brothers the Levites from among the children of Israel they are given to you and to the Lord to do the work of the Tent of meeting
Num  And you and your sons with you are to be responsible as priests for the altar and everything on it and everything inside the veil you are to do the work of priests I have given you your position as priests and any other man who comes near will be put to death
Num  And the Lord said to Aaron See I have given into your care my lifted offerings even all the holy things of the children of Israel I have given to you and to your sons as your right for ever because you have been marked with the holy oil
Num  This is to be yours of the most holy things out of the fire offerings every offering of theirs every meal offering and sinoffering and every offering which they make on account of error is to be most holy for you and your sons
Num  As most holy things they are to be your food let every male have them for food it is to be holy to you
Num  And this is yours the lifted offering which they give and all the wave offerings of the children of Israel I have given to you and to your sons and to your daughters as your right for ever everyone in your house who is clean may have them for food
Num  All the best of the oil and the wine and the grain the firstfruits of them which they give to the Lord to you have I given them
Num  The earliest produce from their land which they take to the Lord is to be yours everyone in your house who is clean may have it for his food
Num  Everything given by oath to the Lord in Israel is to be yours
Num  The first birth of every living thing which is offered to the Lord of man or beast is to be yours but for the first sons of man payment is to be made and for the first young of unclean beasts
Num  Payment is to be made for these when they are a month old at the value fixed by you a price of five shekels by the scale of the holy place that is twenty gerahs to the shekel
Num  But no such payment may be made for the first birth of an ox or a sheep or a goat these are holy their blood is to be dropped on the altar and their fat burned for an offering made by fire a sweet smell to the Lord
Num  Their flesh is to be yours like the breast of the wave offering and the right leg it is to be yours
Num  All the lifted offerings of the holy things which the children of Israel give to the Lord I have given to you and to your sons and to your daughters as a right for ever This is an agreement made with salt before the Lord to you and to your seed for ever
Num  And the Lord said to Aaron You will have no heritage in their land or any part among them I am your part and your heritage among the children of Israel
Num  And to the children of Levi I have given as their heritage all the tenths offered in Israel as payment for the work they do the work of the Tent of meeting
Num  In future the children of Israel are not to come near the Tent of meeting so that death may not come to them because of sin
Num  But the Levites are to do the work of the Tent of meeting and be responsible for errors in connection with it this is a law for ever through all your generations and among the children of Israel they will have no heritage
Num  For the tenths which the children of Israel give as a lifted offering to the Lord I have given to the Levites as their heritage and so I have said to them Among the children of Israel they will have no heritage
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  Say to the Levites When you take from the children of Israel the tenth which I have given to you from them as your heritage a tenth part of that tenth is to be offered as an offering lifted up before the Lord
Num  And this lifted offering is to be put to your credit as if it was grain from the grainfloor and wine from the vines
Num  So you are to make an offering lifted up to the Lord from all the tenths which you get from the children of Israel giving out of it the Lords lifted offering to Aaron the priest
Num  From everything given to you let the best of it the holy part of it be offered as a lifted offering to the Lord
Num  Say to them then When the best of it is lifted up on high it is to be put to the account of the Levites as the increase of the grainfloor and of the place where the grapes are crushed
Num  It is to be your food for you and your families in every place it is your reward for your work in the Tent of meeting
Num  And no sin will be yours on account of it when the best of it has been lifted up on high you are not to make a wrong use of the holy things of the children of Israel so that death may not overtake you
Num  And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron
Num  This is the rule of the law which the Lord has made saying Give orders to the children of Israel to give you a red cow without any mark on her and on which the yoke has never been put
Num  Give her to Eleazar the priest and let him take her outside the tentcircle and have her put to death before him
Num  Then let Eleazar the priest take some of her blood on his finger shaking the blood seven times in the direction of the front of the Tent of meeting
Num  And the cow is to be burned before him her skin and her flesh and her blood and her waste are to be burned
Num  Then let the priest take cedarwood and hyssop and red thread and put them into the fire where the cow is burning
Num  And the priest after washing his clothing and bathing his body in water may come back to the tentcircle and will be unclean till evening
Num  And he who does the burning is to have his clothing washed and his body bathed in water and be unclean till evening
Num  Then let a man who is clean take the dust of the burned cow and put it outside the tentcircle in a clean place where it is to be kept for the children of Israel and used in making the water which takes away what is unclean it is a sinoffering
Num  And he who takes up the dust of the burned cow is to have his clothing washed with water and be unclean till evening this is to be a law for ever for the children of Israel as well as for the man from another country who is living among them
Num  Anyone touching a dead body will be unclean for seven days
Num  On the third day and on the seventh day he is to make himself clean with the water and so he will be clean but if he does not do this on the third day and on the seventh day he will not be clean
Num  Anyone touching the body of a dead man without making himself clean in this way makes the House of the Lord unclean and that man will be cut off from Israel because the water was not put on him he will be unclean his unclean condition is unchanged
Num  This is the law when death comes to a man in his tent everyone who comes into the tent and everyone who is in the tent will be unclean for seven days
Num  And every open vessel without a cover fixed on it will be unclean
Num  And anyone touching one who has been put to death with the sword in the open country or the body of one who has come to his end by a natural death or a mans bone or the restingplace of a dead body will be unclean for seven days
Num  And for the unclean they are to take the dust of the burning of the sinoffering and put flowing water on it in a vessel
Num  And a clean person is to take hyssop and put it in the water shaking it over the tent and all the vessels and the people who were there and over him by whom the bone or the body of one who has been put to death with the sword or the body of one who has come to his end by a natural death or the restingplace was touched
Num  Let the clean person do this to the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day and on the seventh day he is to make him clean and after washing his clothing and bathing himself in water he will be clean in the evening
Num  But the man who being unclean does not make himself clean in this way will be cut off from the meeting of the people because he has made the holy place of the Lord unclean the water has not been put on him he is unclean
Num  This is to be a law for them for ever he who puts the water on the unclean person is to have his clothing washed and anyone touching the water will be unclean till evening
Num  Anything touched by the unclean person will be unclean and any person touching it will be unclean till evening
Num  In the first month all the children of Israel came into the waste land of Zin and put up their tents in Kadesh there death came to Miriam and they put her body to rest in the earth
Num  And there was no water for the people and they came together against Moses and against Aaron
Num  And the people were angry with Moses and said If only death had overtaken us when our brothers came to their death before the Lord
Num  Why have you taken the Lords people into this waste for death to come to us and to our cattle there
Num  Why have you made us come out of Egypt into this evil place This is no place of seed or figs or vines or other fruits and there is no water for drinking
Num  Then Moses and Aaron went away from the people to the door of the Tent of meeting and falling on their faces there they saw the glory of the Lord
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  Take the rod you and Aaron your brother and make all the people come together and before their eyes give orders to the rock to give out its water and so make water come out of the rock for them and give the people and their cattle drink
Num  And Moses took the rod from before the Lord as he gave him orders
Num  Then Moses and Aaron made the people come together in front of the rock and he said to them Give ear now you people whose hearts are turned from the Lord are we to get water for you out of the rock
Num  And lifting up his hand Moses gave the rock two blows with his rod and water came streaming out and the people and their cattle had drink enough
Num  Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron Because you had not enough faith in me to keep my name holy before the children of Israel you will not take this people into the land which I have given them
Num  These are the waters of Meribah because the children of Israel went against the Lord and they saw that he was holy among them
Num  Then Moses sent men from Kadesh to the king of Edom to say to him Your brother Israel says You have knowledge of all the things we have been through
Num  How our fathers went down into Egypt and we were living in Egypt for a long time and the Egyptians were cruel to us and to our fathers
Num  And the Lord gave ear to the voice of our cry and sent an angel and took us out of Egypt and now we are in Kadesh a town on the edge of your land
Num  Let us now go through your land we will not go into field or vinegarden or take the water of the springs we will go by the highway not turning to the right or to the left till we have gone past the limits of your land
Num  And Edom said You are not to go through my land for if you do I will come out against you with the sword
Num  And the children of Israel said to him We will go up by the highway and if we or our cattle take of your water we will give you a price for it only let us go through on our feet nothing more
Num  But he said You are not to go through And Edom came out against them in his strength with a great army
Num  So Edom would not let Israel go through his land and Israel went in another direction
Num  And they went on from Kadesh and came with all their people to Mount Hor
Num  And at Mount Hor at the edge of the land of Edom the Lord said to Moses and Aaron
Num  Aaron will be put to rest with his people he will not go into the land which I have given to the children of Israel because you went against my word at the waters of Meribah
Num  So take Aaron and Eleazar his son up into Mount Hor
Num  And take Aarons robes off him and put them on Eleazar his son and death will come to Aaron there and he will be put to rest with his people
Num  So Moses did as the Lord had said and before the eyes of all the people they went up Mount Hor
Num  And Moses took off Aarons robes and put them on Eleazar his son and there on the top of the mountain death came to Aaron then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain
Num  And when the people saw that Aaron was dead all the children of Israel gave themselves up to weeping for him for thirty days
Num  And it came to the ears of the Canaanite the king of Arad living in the South that Israel was coming by the way of Atharim and he came out against them and took some of them prisoners
Num  Then Israel made an oath to the Lord and said If you will give up this people into my hands then I will send complete destruction on all their towns
Num  And the Lord in answer to the voice of Israel gave the Canaanites up to them and they put them and their towns completely to destruction and that place was named Hormah
Num  Then they went on from Mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea going round the land of Edom and the spirit of the people was overcome with weariness on the way
Num  And crying out against God and against Moses they said Why have you taken us out of Egypt to come to our death in the waste land For there is no bread and no water and this poor bread is disgusting to us
Num  Then the Lord sent poisonsnakes among the people and their bites were a cause of death to numbers of the people of Israel
Num  Then the people came to Moses and said We have done wrong in crying out against the Lord and against you make prayer to the Lord to take away the snakes from us So Moses made prayer for the people
Num  And the Lord said to Moses Make an image of a snake and put it on a rod and anyone who has been wounded by the snakes looking on it will be made well
Num  So Moses made a snake of brass and put it on a rod and anyone who had a snakebite after looking on the snake of brass was made well
Num  Then the children of Israel went on and put up their tents in Oboth
Num  And journeying on again from Oboth they put up their tents in Iyeabarim in the waste land before Moab looking east
Num  And moving on from there they put up their tents in the valley of Zered
Num  From there they went on and put up their tents on the other side of the Arnon which is on the waste land at the edge of the land of the Amorites for the Arnon is the line of division between Moab and the Amorites
Num  As it says in the book of the Wars of the Lord Vaheb in Suphah and the valley of the Amon
Num  The slope of the valleys going down to the tents of Ar and touching the edge of Moab
Num  From there they went on to Beer the waterspring of which the Lord said to Moses Make the people come together and I will give them water
Num  Then Israel gave voice to this song Come up O waterspring let us make a song to it
Num  The fountain made by the chiefs made deep by the great ones of the people with the lawgivers rod and with their sticks Then from the waste land they went on to Mattanah
Num  And from Mattanah to Nahaliel and from Nahaliel to Bamoth
Num  And from Bamoth to the valley in the open country of Moab and to the top of Pisgah looking over Jeshimon
Num  And Israel sent men to Sihon king of the Amorites saying
Num  Let me go through your land we will not go into field or vinegarden or take the water of the springs we will go by the highway till we have gone past the limits of your land
Num  And Sihon would not let Israel go through his land but got all his people together and went out against Israel into the waste land as far as Jahaz to make war on Israel
Num  But Israel overcame him and took all his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok as far as the country of the children of Ammon for the country of the children of Ammon was strongly armed
Num  And Israel took all their towns living in Heshbon and all the towns and small places of the Amorites
Num  For Heshbon was the town of Sihon king of the Amorites who had made war against an earlier king of Moab and taken from him all his land as far as the Arnon
Num  So the makers of wise sayings say Come to Heshbon building up the town of Sihon and making it strong
Num  For a fire has gone out of Heshbon a flame from the town of Sihon for the destruction of Ar in Moab and the lords of the high places of the Arnon
Num  Sorrow is yours O Moab Destruction is your fate O people of Chemosh his sons have gone in flight and his daughters are prisoners in the hands of Sihon king of the Amorites
Num  They are wounded with our arrows destruction has come on Heshbon even to Dibon and we have made the land waste as far as Nophah stretching out to Medeba
Num  So Israel put up their tents in the land of the Amorites
Num  And Moses sent men secretly to Jazer and they took its towns driving out the Amorites who were living there
Num  Then turning they went up by the way of Bashan and Og king of Bashan went out against them with all his people to the fight at Edrei
Num  And the Lord said to Moses Have no fear of him for I have given him up into your hands with all his people and his land do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites at Heshbon
Num  So they overcame him and his sons and his people driving them all out and they took his land for their heritage
Num  Then the children of Israel journeying on put up their tents in the lowlands of Moab on the other side of Jordan at Jericho
Num  Now Balak the son of Zippor saw what Israel had done to the Amorites
Num  And in Moab there was great fear of the people because their numbers were so great and the feeling of Moab was bitter against the children of Israel
Num  Then Moab said to the responsible men of Midian It is clear that this great people will be the destruction of everything round us making a meal of us as the ox does of the grass of the field At that time Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab
Num  So he sent men to Balaam son of Beor at Pethor by the River in the land of the children of his people saying to him See a people has come out of Egypt covering all the face of the earth and they have put up their tents opposite to me
Num  Come now in answer to my prayer and put a curse on this people for they are greater than I and then I may be strong enough to overcome them and send them out of the land for it is clear that good comes to him who has your blessing but he on whom you put your curse is cursed
Num  So the responsible men of Moab and Midian went away taking in their hands rewards for the prophet and they came to Balaam and said to him what Balak had given them orders to say
Num  And he said to them Take your rest here tonight and I will give you an answer after hearing what the Lord says so the chiefs of Moab kept there with Balaam that night
Num  And God came to Balaam and said Who are these men with you
Num  And Balaam said to God Balak the son of Zippor king of Moab has sent them to me saying
Num  See the people who have come out of Egypt are covering all the earth now put a curse on this people for me so that I may be able to make war on them driving them out of the land
Num  And God said to Balaam You are not to go with them or put a curse on this people for they have my blessing
Num  In the morning Balaam got up and said to the chiefs of Balak Go back to your land for the Lord will not let me go with you
Num  So the chiefs of Moab went back to Balak and said Balaam will not come with us
Num  So Balak sent more chiefs greater in number and of higher position than the others
Num  And they came to Balaam and said Balak son of Zippor says Let nothing keep you from coming to me
Num  For I will give you a place of very great honour and whatever you say to me I will do so come in answer to my prayer and put a curse on this people
Num  But Balaam in answer said to the servants of Balak Even if Balak gave me his house full of silver and gold it would not be possible for me to do anything more or less than the orders of the Lord my God
Num  So take your rest here this night till I have knowledge what more the Lord has to say to me
Num  And that night God came to Balaam and said to him If these men have come for you go with them but do only what I say to you
Num  So in the morning Balaam got up and making his ass ready went with the chiefs of Moab
Num  But God was moved to wrath because he went and the angel of the Lord took up a position in the road to keep him from his purpose Now he was seated on his ass and his two servants were with him
Num  And the ass saw the angel of the Lord waiting in the road with his sword in his hand and turning from the road the ass went into the field and Balaam gave the ass blows to get her back on to the road
Num  Then the angel of the Lord took up his position in a narrow road through the vinegardens with a wall on this side and on that
Num  And the ass saw the angel of the Lord and went near the wall crushing Balaams foot against the wall and he gave her more blows
Num  Then the angel of the Lord went further stopping in a narrow place where there was no room for turning to the right or to the left
Num  And the ass saw the angel of the Lord and went down on the earth under Balaam and full of wrath Balaam gave her hard blows with his stick
Num  Then the Lord gave the ass the power of talking and opening her mouth she said to Balaam What have I done to you that you have given me blows these three times
Num  And Balaam said to the ass You have made me seem foolish if only I had a sword in my hand I would put you to death
Num  And the ass said to Balaam Am I not your ass upon which you have gone all your life till this day and have I ever done this to you before And he said No
Num  Then the Lord made Balaams eyes open and he saw the angel of the Lord in the way with his sword in his hand and he went down on his face to the earth
Num  And the angel of the Lord said to him Why have you given your ass blows these three times See I have come out against you to keep you back because your purpose is not pleasing to me
Num  And the ass saw me turning to one side from me three times if she had not gone to one side I would certainly have put you to death and kept her safe
Num  And Balaam said to the angel of the Lord I have done wrong for I did not see that you were in the way against me but now if it is evil in your eyes I will go back again
Num  And the angel of the Lord said to Balaam Go with the men but say only what I give you to say Then Balaam went on with the chiefs of Balak
Num  Now Balak hearing that Balaam had come went to the chief town of Moab on the edge of the Arnon in the farthest part of the land for the purpose of meeting him
Num  And Balak said to Balaam Did I not send to you requesting you with all my heart to come to me why did you not come am I not able to give you a place of honour
Num  Then Balaam said to Balak Now I have come to you but have I power to say anything Only what God puts into my mouth may I say
Num  And Balaam went with Balak to Kiriathhuzoth
Num  And Balak made offerings of oxen and sheep and sent to Balaam and the chiefs who were with him
Num  And in the morning Balak took Balaam up to the high places of Baal and from there he was able to see the outer limits of the people
Num  And Balaam said to Balak Make me here seven altars and get ready seven oxen and seven male sheep
Num  And Balak did as Balaam had said and Balak and Balaam made an offering on every altar of an ox and a male sheep
Num  Then Balaam said to Balak Take your place by your burned offering and I will go and see if the Lord comes to me and I will give you word of whatever he says to me And he went to an open place on a hill
Num  And God came to Balaam and Balaam said to him I have made ready seven altars offering an ox and a male sheep on every altar
Num  And the Lord put words in Balaams mouth and said Go back to Balak and this is what you are to say
Num  So he went back to him where he was waiting by his burned offering with all the chiefs of Moab
Num  And in the words which the Lord had given him he said From Aram Balak has sent for me the king of Moab from the mountains of the East come put curses on Jacob for me and be angry with Israel
Num  How may I put curses on him who is not cursed by God how may I be angry with him with whom the Lord is not angry
Num  From the top of the rocks I see him looking down on him from the hills it is a people made separate not to be numbered among the nations
Num  Who is able to take the measure of the dust of Jacob or the number of the thousands of Israel May my death be the death of the upright and my last end like his
Num  Then Balak said to Balaam What have you done to me I sent for you so that my haters might be cursed and see you have given them a blessing
Num  And in answer he said Am I not ordered to say only what the Lord puts into my mouth
Num  And Balak said to him Come with me now into another place from which you will not be able to see them all but only the outskirts of them and you will send curses on them from there
Num  So he took him into the country of Zophim to the top of Pisgah and there they made seven altars offering an ox and a male sheep on every altar
Num  Then he said to Balak Take your place here by your burned offering while I go over there to the Lord
Num  And the Lord came to Balaam and put words in his mouth and said Go back to Balak and this is what you are to say
Num  So he came to him where he was waiting by his burned offering with the chiefs of Moab by his side And Balak said to him What has the Lord said
Num  And in the words which the Lord had given him he said Up Balak and give ear give attention to me O son of Zippor
Num  God is not a man to say what is false or the son of man that his purpose may be changed what he has said will he not do and will he not give effect to the words of his mouth
Num  See I have had orders to give blessing and he has given a blessing which I have no power to take away
Num  He has seen no evil in Jacob or wrongdoing in Israel the Lord his God is with him and the glad cry of a king is among them
Num  It is God who has taken them out of Egypt his horns are like those of the mountain ox
Num  No evil power has effect against Jacob no secret arts against Israel at the right time it will be said of Jacob and of Israel See what God has done
Num  See Israel comes up like a shelion lifting himself up like a lion he will take no rest till he has made a meal of those he has overcome drinking the blood of those he has put to death
Num  Then Balak said to Balaam If you will not put a curse on them at all events do not give them a blessing
Num  But Balaam in answer said to Balak Did I not say to you I may only do what the Lord says
Num  Then Balak said to Balaam Come now I will take you to another place it may be that God will let you put a curse on them from there
Num  So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor looking down over the waste land
Num  And Balaam said to Balak Make me seven altars here and get seven oxen and seven male sheep ready for me
Num  And Balak did as Balaam said offering an ox and a male sheep on every altar
Num  Now when Balaam saw that it was the Lords pleasure to give his blessing to Israel he did not as at other times make use of secret arts but turning his face to the waste land
Num  And lifting up his eyes he saw Israel there with their tents in the order of their tribes and the spirit of God came on him
Num  And moved by the spirit he said These are the words of Balaam son of Beor the words of the man whose eyes are open
Num  He says whose ears are open to the words of God who has seen the vision of the Ruler of all falling down but having his eyes open
Num  How fair are your tents O Jacob your houses O Israel
Num  They are stretched out like valleys like gardens by the riverside like flowering trees planted by the Lord like cedartrees by the waters
Num  Peoples will be in fear before his strength his arm will be on great nations his king will be higher than Agag and his kingdom made great in honour
Num  It is God who has taken him out of Egypt his horns are like those of the mountain ox the nations warring against him will be his food their bones will be broken they will be wounded with his arrows
Num  He took his sleep stretched out like a lion and like a shelion by whom will his rest be broken May a blessing be on everyone who gives you blessing and a curse on everyone by whom you are cursed
Num  Then Balak was full of wrath against Balaam and angrily waving his hands he said to Balaam I sent for you so that those who are against me might be cursed but now see three times you have given them a blessing
Num  Go back quickly to the place you came from it was my purpose to give you a place of honour but now the Lord has kept you back from honour
Num  Then Balaam said to Balak Did I not say to the men you sent to me
Num  Even if Balak gave me his house full of silver and gold it would not be possible for me to go outside the orders of the Lord doing good or evil at the impulse of my mind whatever the Lord says I will say
Num  So now I will go back to my people but first let me make clear to you what this people will do to your people in days to come
Num  Then he went on with his story and said These are the words of Balaam the son of Beor the words of him whose eyes are open
Num  He says whose ear is open to the words of God who has knowledge of the Most High who has seen the vision of the Ruler of all falling down and having his eyes open
Num  I see him but not now looking on him but not near a star will come out of Jacob and a rod of authority out of Israel sending destruction to the farthest limits of Moab and on the head of all the sons of Sheth
Num  Edom will be his heritage and he will put an end to the last of the people of Seir
Num  And Israel will go on in strength and Jacob will have rule over his haters
Num  Then turning his eyes to Amalek he went on with his story and said Amalek was the first of the nations but his part will be destruction for ever
Num  And looking on the Kenites he went on with his story and said Strong is your livingplace and your secret place is safe in the rock
Num  But still the Kenites will be wasted till Asshur takes you away prisoner
Num  Then he went on with his story and said But who may keep his life when God does this
Num  But ships will come from the direction of Kittim troubling Asshur and troubling Eber and like the others their fate will be destruction
Num  Then Balaam got up and went back to his place and Balak went away
Num  Now when Israel was living in Shittim the people became false to the Lord doing evil with the daughters of Moab
Num  For they sent for the people to be present at the offerings made to their gods and the people took part in their feasts and gave honour to their gods
Num  So Israel had relations with the women of Moab in honour of the Baal of Peor and the Lord was moved to wrath against Israel
Num  Then the Lord said to Moses Take all the chiefs of the people hanging them up in the sun before the Lord so that the wrath of the Lord may be turned from Israel
Num  So Moses said to the judges of Israel Let everyone put to death those of his men who have had relations with the women of Moab in honour of the Baal of Peor
Num  Then one of the children of Israel came to his brothers taking with him a woman of Midian before the eyes of Moses and all the meeting of the people while they were weeping at the door of the Tent of meeting
Num  And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest seeing it got up from among the people and took a spear in his hand
Num  And went after the man of Israel into the tent driving the spear through the two of them through the man of Israel and through the stomach of the woman So the disease was stopped among the children of Israel
Num  But twentyfour thousand of them had come to their death by the disease
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  Through Phinehas and because of his passion for my honour my wrath has been turned away from the children of Israel so that I have not sent destruction on them all in my wrath
Num  So say to them that I will make with him an agreement of peace
Num  And by this agreement he and his sons after him have the right to be priests for ever because by his care for the honour of his God he took away the sin of the children of Israel
Num  Now the man of Israel who was put to death with the woman of Midian was Zimri the son of Salu a chief of one of the families of the Simeonites
Num  And the woman of Midian who was put to death was Cozbi the daughter of Zur he was the head of a family in Midian
Num  Then the Lord said to Moses
Num  Take up arms against the Midianites and overcome them
Num  For they are a danger to you with their false ways causing sin to come on you in the question of Peor and because of Cozbi their sister the daughter of the chief of Midian who was put to death at the time of the disease which came on you because of Peor
Num  Now after the disease was over the Lord said to Moses and Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest
Num  Let all the children of Israel be numbered by the names of their fathers families all those of twenty years old and over who are able to go to war in Israel
Num  So Moses and Eleazar the priest gave them the order in the lowlands of Moab by Jordan at Jericho saying
Num  Let all the people of twenty years old and over be numbered as the Lord has given orders to Moses and the children of Israel who have come out of Egypt

Num  Those who were numbered of the children of Israel were six hundred and one thousand seven hundred and thirty
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  Let there be a division of the land among these for their heritage in relation to the number of names
Num  To those families who are more in number give a greater heritage to those who are less in number a smaller part to every one let the heritage be given in relation to the number in his family
Num  But let the distribution of the land be made by the decision of the Lord by the names of the tribes of their fathers let their heritage be given them
Num  As it is ordered by the decision of the Lord let distribution be made between those who are more in number and those who are less
Num  These were those of the Levites who were numbered by their families of Gershon the family of the Gershonites of Kohath the family of the Kohathites of Merari the family of the Merarites

Num  Death overtook Nadab and Abihu when they made an offering of strange fire before the Lord
Num  Of these twentythree thousand males from one month old and over were numbered they were not numbered with the rest of the children of Israel for they had no heritage among the children of Israel
Num  All these were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest when the children of Israel were numbered in the lowlands of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho
Num  But among all these was not one of those numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest when the children of Israel were numbered in the waste land of Sinai
Num  For the Lord had said of them Death will certainly overtake them in the waste land And of them all only Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun were still living
Num  Then the daughters of Zelophehad the son of Hepher the son of Gilead the son of Machir the son of Manasseh of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph came forward their names are Mahlah Noah and Hoglah and Milcah and Tirzah

Num  Death overtook our father in the waste land he was not among those who were banded together with Korah against the Lord but death came to him in his sin and he had no sons
Num  Why is the name of our father to be taken away from among his family because he had no son Give us a heritage among our fathers brothers
Num  So Moses put their cause before the Lord
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  What the daughters of Zelophehad say is right certainly you are to give them a heritage among their fathers brothers and let the property which would have been their fathers go to them
Num  And say to the children of Israel If a man has no son at the time of his death let his heritage go to his daughter
Num  And if he has no daughter then give his heritage to his brothers
Num  And if he has no brothers then give his heritage to his fathers brothers
Num  And if his father has no brothers then give it to his nearest relation in the family as his heritage this is to be a decision made by law for the children of Israel as the Lord gave orders to Moses
Num  And the Lord said to Moses Go up into this mountain of Abarim so that you may see the land which I have given to the children of Israel
Num  And when you have seen it you will be put to rest with your people as your brother Aaron was
Num  Because in the waste land of Zin when the people were angry you and he went against my word and did not keep my name holy before their eyes at the waters These are the waters of Meribah in Kadesh in the waste land of Zin
Num  Then Moses said to the Lord
Num  Let the Lord the God of the spirits of all flesh put a man at the head of this people
Num  To go out and come in before them and be their guide so that the people of the Lord may not be like sheep without a keeper
Num  And the Lord said to Moses Take Joshua the son of Nun a man in whom is the spirit and put your hand on him
Num  And take him before Eleazar the priest and all the meeting of the people and give him his orders before their eyes
Num  And put your honour on him so that all the children of Israel may be under his authority
Num  He will take his place before Eleazar the priest so that he may get directions from the Lord for him with the Urim at his word they will go out and at his word they will come in he and all the children of Israel
Num  So Moses did as the Lord said he took Joshua and put him before Eleazar the priest and the meeting of the people
Num  And he put his hands on him and gave him his orders as the Lord had said by Moses
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  Give orders to the children of Israel and say to them Let it be your care to give me my offerings at their regular times the food of the offerings made by fire to me for a sweet smell
Num  Say to them This is the offering made by fire which you are to give to the Lord helambs of the first year without any mark two every day as a regular burned offering

Num  So Moses gave the children of Israel all these directions as the Lord had given him orders
Num  And Moses said to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel This is the order of the Lord
Num  When a man takes an oath to the Lord or gives an undertaking having the force of an oath let him not go back from his word but let him do whatever he has said he will do
Num  If a woman being young and under the authority of her father takes an oath to the Lord or gives an undertaking
Num  If her father hearing of her oath or the undertaking she has given says nothing to her then all her oaths and every undertaking she has given will have force
Num  But if her father hearing of it makes her take back her word then the oaths or the undertakings she has given will have no force and she will have forgiveness from the Lord because her oath was broken by her father
Num  And if she is married to a husband at the time when she is under an oath or an undertaking given without thought
Num  If her husband hearing of it says nothing to her at the time then the oaths she made and the undertakings she gave will have force
Num  But if her husband hearing of it makes her take it back then the oath she made and the undertaking she gave without thought will have no force or effect and she will have the Lords forgiveness
Num  But an oath made by a widow or one who is no longer married to her husband and every undertaking she has given will have force
Num  If she made an oath while she was under the authority of her husband
Num  And her husband hearing of it said nothing to her and did not put a stop to it then all her oaths and every undertaking she gave will have force
Num  But if her husband on hearing of it made them without force or effect then whatever she has said about her oaths or her undertaking has no force her husband has made them without effect and she will have the Lords forgiveness
Num  Every oath and every undertaking which she gives to keep herself from pleasure may be supported or broken by her husband
Num  But if the days go on and her husband says nothing whatever to her then he is giving the support of his authority to her oaths and undertakings because at the time of hearing them he said nothing to her
Num  But if at some time after hearing of them he makes them without force then he is responsible for her wrongdoing
Num  These are the laws which the Lord gave Moses in relation to a man and his wife or a father and a young daughter who is under his authority
Num  Then the Lord said to Moses
Num  Give the Midianites punishment for the wrong they did to the children of Israel and after that you will go to rest with your people
Num  So Moses said to the people Let men from among you be armed for war to put into effect against Midian the Lords punishment on them
Num  From every tribe of Israel send a thousand to the war
Num  So from the thousands of Israel a thousand were taken from every tribe twelve thousand men armed for war
Num  And Moses sent them out to war a thousand from every tribe and with them Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest taking in his hands the vessels of the holy place and the horns for sounding the note of war
Num  And they made war on Midian as the Lord gave orders to Moses and they put to death every male
Num  They put the kings of Midian to death with the rest Evi and Reken and Zur and Hur and Reba the five kings of Midian and Balaam the son of Beor they put to death with the sword
Num  The women of Midian with their little ones the children of Israel took prisoner and all their cattle and flocks and all their goods they took for themselves
Num  And after burning all their towns and all their tentcircles
Num  They went away with the goods they had taken man and beast
Num  And the prisoners and the goods and everything they had taken they took to Moses and Eleazar the priest and the people of Israel to the tentcircle in the lowlands of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho
Num  Then Moses and Eleazar the priest and the chiefs of the people went out to them before they had come into the tentcircle
Num  And Moses was angry with the chiefs of the army the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds who had come back from the war
Num  And Moses said to them Why have you kept all the women safe
Num  It was these who moved by Balaam were the cause of Israels sin against the Lord in the question of Peor because of which disease came on the people of the Lord
Num  So now put every male child to death and every woman who has had sex relations with a man
Num  But all the female children who have had no sex relations with men you may keep for yourselves
Num  You yourselves will have to keep outside the tentcircle for seven days anyone of you who has put any person to death or come near a dead body and on the third day and on the seventh day make yourselves and your prisoners clean
Num  And every bit of clothing and anything made of leather or goats hair or wood you are to make clean
Num  Then Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who had been to the fight This is the rule of the law which the Lord has given to Moses
Num  But gold and silver and brass and iron and tin and lead
Num  And anything which may be heated is to go through the fire and be made clean but in addition it is to be put in the water of cleaning and anything which may not go through the fire is to be put in the water
Num  And on the seventh day after washing your clothing you will be clean and then you may come into the tentcircle
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  Get an account of everything which was taken in the war of man and of beast you and Eleazar the priest and the heads of families of the people
Num  And let division be made of it into two parts one for the men of war who went out to the fight and one for all the people
Num  And from the men of war who went out let there be offered to the Lord one out of every five hundred from the persons and from the oxen and asses and sheep
Num  Take this from their part and give it to Eleazar the priest as an offering to be lifted up to the Lord
Num  And from the part given to the children of Israel take one out of every fifty from the persons and from the oxen and asses and sheep and give it to the Levites who have the care of the House of the Lord
Num  So Eleazar and Moses did as the Lord had given orders to Moses
Num  Now the beasts taken in addition to what the fightingmen took for themselves were six hundred and seventyfive thousand sheep
Num  And seventytwo thousand oxen
Num  And sixtyone thousand asses
Num  And thirtytwo thousand persons that is women who had never had sex relations with a man
Num  And the half given as their part to the men who went to the war was three hundred and thirtyseven thousand five hundred sheep
Num  Of which the Lords part was six hundred and seventyfive
Num  The number of oxen was thirtysix thousand of which the Lords part was seventytwo
Num  The number of asses was thirty thousand five hundred of which the Lords part was sixtyone
Num  And the number of persons was sixteen thousand of which the Lords part was thirtytwo persons
Num  And Moses gave the Lords part lifted up as an offering to Eleazar the priest as the Lord had given orders to Moses
Num  And from the half given to the children of Israel which Moses had kept separate from that given to the fightingmen
Num  Now the peoples half was three hundred and thirtyseven thousand five hundred sheep
Num  And thirtysix thousand oxen
Num  And thirty thousand five hundred asses
Num  And sixteen thousand persons
Num  Even from the children of Israels half Moses took one out of every fifty men and beasts and gave them to the Levites who had the care of the House of the Lord as the Lord gave orders to Moses
Num  Then the men in authority over the thousands of the army the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds came to Moses
Num  And said to him Your servants have taken note of the number of all the fightingmen under our orders and every one is present
Num  And we have here an offering for the Lord from what every man took in the war ornaments of gold legchains and armrings fingerrings earrings and neckornaments to make our souls free from sin before the Lord
Num  So Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them even all the worked ornaments
Num  And the gold which the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds gave as an offering to be lifted up before the Lord came to sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels
Num  For every man of the army had taken goods for himself in the war
Num  Then Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold given by the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds and took it into the Tent of meeting to be a sign in memory of the children of Israel before the Lord
Num  Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a great number of cattle and when they saw that the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead was a good place for cattle
Num  The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and said to Moses and to Eleazar the priest and to the chiefs of the meeting
Num  Ataroth and Dibon and Jazer and Nimrah and Heshbon and Elealeh and Sebam and Nebo and Beon
Num  The land which the Lord gave into the hands of the children of Israel is a land for cattle and your servants have cattle
Num  And they said With your approval let this land be given to your servants as their heritage do not take us over Jordan
Num  And Moses said to the children of Gad and the children of Reuben Are your brothers to go to the war while you take your rest here
Num  Why would you take from the children of Israel the desire to go over into the land which the Lord has given them
Num  So did your fathers when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land
Num  For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol and saw the land they took from the children of Israel the desire to go into the land which the Lord had given them
Num  And at that time the Lord was moved to wrath and made an oath saying
Num  Truly not one of the men of twenty years old and over who came out of Egypt will see the land which I gave by oath to Abraham Isaac and Jacob because they have not been true to me with all their heart
Num  But only Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua the son of Nun because they have been true to the Lord
Num  Then the Lord was angry with Israel and he made them wanderers in the waste land for forty years till all that generation who had done evil in the eyes of the Lord was dead
Num  And now you have come to take the place of your fathers another generation of sinners increasing the wrath of the Lord against Israel
Num  For if you are turned away from him he will send them wandering again in the waste land and you will be the cause of the destruction of all this people
Num  Then they came to him and said We will make safe places for our cattle here and towns for our little ones
Num  But we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel till we have taken them to their place but our little ones will be safe in the walled towns against the people of the land
Num  We will not come back to our houses till every one of the children of Israel has come into his heritage
Num  For we will not have our heritage with them on the other side of Jordan and forward because our heritage has come to us on this side of Jordan to the east
Num  Then Moses said to them If you will do this arming yourselves to go before the Lord to the war
Num  Every armed man of you going across Jordan before the Lord till he has overcome and sent in flight all who are against him
Num  And the land is under the rule of the Lord then after that you may come back having done no wrong to the Lord and to Israel and this land will be yours for your heritage before the Lord
Num  But if you do not do this then you are sinners against the Lord and you may be certain that your sin will have its reward
Num  So get to work building your towns for your little ones and safe places for your sheep and do as you have said
Num  And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben said to Moses Your servants will do as my lord says
Num  Our little ones our wives and our flocks and all our cattle will be there in the towns of Gilead
Num  But your servants will go over every man armed for war before the Lord to the fight as my lord says
Num  So Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar the priest and to Joshua the son of Nun and to the heads of families of the tribes of the children of Israel
Num  And Moses said to them If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben go with you over Jordan every man armed for the fight before the Lord and all the land is given into your hands then let them have the land of Gilead for a heritage
Num  But if they do not go over with you armed they will have to take their heritage with you in the land of Canaan
Num  Then the children of Gad and the children of Reuben said As the Lord has said to your servants so will we do
Num  We will go over armed before the Lord into the land of Canaan and you will give us our heritage on this side of Jordan
Num  So Moses gave to them even to the children of Gad and the children of Reuben and to the halftribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and Og king of Bashan all the land with its towns and the country round them
Num  And the children of Gad were the builders of Dibon and Ataroth and Aroer
Num  And Atrothshophan and Jazer and Jogbehah
Num  And Bethnimrah and Bethharan walled towns and shutin places for sheep
Num  And the children of Reuben were the builders of Heshbon and Elealeh and Kiriathaim
Num  And Nebo and Baalmeon their names being changed and Sibmah and they gave other names to the towns they made
Num  And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead and took it driving out the Amorites who were living there
Num  And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh and he made it his livingplace
Num  And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the towns of Gilead naming them HavvothJair
Num  And Nobah went and took Kenath and its small towns naming it Nobah after himself
Num  These are the journeys of the children of Israel when they went out of the land of Egypt in their armies under the direction of Moses and Aaron
Num  And the stages of their journey on their way out were put down in writing by Moses at the order of the Lord these are the stages of their journey and the way they went
Num  On the fifteenth day of the first month they went out from Rameses on the day after the Passover the children of Israel went out by the power of the Lord before the eyes of all the Egyptians
Num  While the Egyptians were placing in the earth the bodies of their sons on whom the Lord had sent destruction and their gods had been judged by him
Num  So the children of Israel went from Rameses and put up their tents in Succoth
Num  And they went on from Succoth and put up their tents in Etham on the edge of the waste land
Num  And from Etham turning back to Pihahiroth which is before Baalzephon they put up their tents before Migdol
Num  And journeying on from before Hahiroth they went through the sea into the waste land they went three days journey through the waste land of Etham and put up their tents in Marah
Num  And from Marah they went on to Elim and in Elim there were twelve watersprings and seventy palmtrees and they put up their tents there
Num  And they went on from Elim and put up their tents by the Red Sea
Num  Then from the Red Sea they went on and put up their tents in the waste land of Sin
Num  And they went on from the waste land of Sin and put up their tents in Dophkah
Num  And they went on from Dophkah and put up their tents in Alush
Num  And they went on from Alush and put up their tents in Rephidim where there was no drinkingwater for the people
Num  And they went on from Rephidim and put up their tents in the waste land of Sinai
Num  And they went on from the waste land of Sinai and put up their tents in Kibrothhattaavah
Num  And they went on from Kibrothhattaavah and put up their tents in Hazeroth
Num  And they went on from Hazeroth and put up their tents in Rithmah
Num  And they went on from Rithmah and put up their tents in Rimmonperez
Num  And they went on from Rimmonperez and put up their tents in Libnah
Num  And they went on from Libnah and put up their tents in Rissah
Num  And they went on from Rissah and put up their tents in Kehelathah
Num  And they went on from Kehelathah and put up their tents in Mount Shepher
Num  And they went on from Mount Shepher and put up their tents in Haradah
Num  And they went on from Haradah and put up their tents in Makheloth
Num  And they went on from Makheloth and put up their tents in Tahath
Num  And they went on from Tahath and put up their tents in Terah
Num  And they went on from Terah and put up their tents in Mithkah
Num  And they went on from Mithkah and put up their tents in Hashmonah
Num  And they went on from Hashmonah and put up their tents in Moseroth
Num  And they went on from Moseroth and put up their tents in Benejaakan
Num  And they went on from Benejaakan and put up their tents in Horhaggidgad
Num  And they went on from Horhaggidgad and put up their tents in Jotbathah
Num  And they went on from Jotbathah and put up their tents in Abronah
Num  And they went on from Abronah and put up their tents in Eziongeber
Num  And they went on from Eziongeber and put up their tents in the waste land of Zin which is Kadesh
Num  And they went on from Kadesh and put up their tents in Mount Hor on the edge of the land of Edom
Num  And Aaron the priest went up into the mountain at the order of the Lord and came to his death there in the fortieth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt in the fifth month on the first day of the month
Num  Aaron was a hundred and twentythree years old at the time of his death in Mount Hor
Num  And news of the coming of the children of Israel came to the king of Arad the Canaanite who was living in the South in the land of Canaan
Num  And from Mount Hor they went on and put up their tents in Zalmonah
Num  And they went on from Zalmonah and put up their tents in Punon
Num  And they went on from Punon and put up their tents in Oboth
Num  And they went on from Oboth and put up their tents in Iyeabarim at the edge of Moab
Num  And they went on from Iyim and put up their tents in Dibongad
Num  And from Dibongad they went on and put up their tents in Almondiblathaim
Num  And from Almondiblathaim they went on and put up their tents in the mountains of Abarim before Nebo
Num  And they went on from the mountains of Abarim and put up their tents in the lowlands of Moab by Jordan at Jericho
Num  Planting their tents by the side of Jordan from Bethjeshimoth as far as Abelshittim in the lowlands of Moab
Num  And in the lowlands of Moab by Jordan at Jericho the Lord said to Moses
Num  Say to the children of Israel When you go over Jordan into the land of Canaan
Num  See that all the people of the land are forced out from before you and put to destruction all their pictured stones and all their metal images and all their high places
Num  And take the land for yourselves for your restingplace for to you I have given the land as your heritage
Num  And you will take up your heritage in the land by the decision of the Lord to every family its part the greater the family the greater its heritage and the smaller the family the smaller will be its heritage wherever the decision of the Lord gives to any man his part that will be his distribution will be made to you by your fathers tribes
Num  But if you are slow in driving out the people of the land then those of them who are still there will be like pinpoints in your eyes and like thorns in your sides troubling you in the land where you are living
Num  And it will come about that as it was my purpose to do to them so I will do to you
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  Give orders to the children of Israel and say to them When you come into the land of Canaan this is the land which is to be your heritage the land of Canaan inside these limits
Num  Then your south quarter will be from the waste land of Zin by the side of Edom and your limit on the south will be from the east end of the Salt Sea
Num  And round to the south of the slope of Akrabbim and on to Zin and its direction will be south of Kadeshbarnea and it will go as far as Hazaraddar and on to Azmon
Num  And from Azmon it will go round to the stream of Egypt as far as the sea
Num  And for your limit on the west you will have the Great Sea and its edge this will be your limit on the west
Num  And your limit on the north will be the line from the Great Sea to Mount Hor
Num  And from Mount Hor the line will go in the direction of Hamath the farthest point of it will be at Zedad
Num  And the limit will go on to Ziphron with its farthest point at Hazarenan this will be your limit on the north
Num  And on the east your limit will be marked out from Hazarenan to Shepham
Num  Going down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain and on as far as the east side of the sea of Chinnereth
Num  And so down to Jordan stretching to the Salt Sea all the land inside these limits will be yours
Num  And Moses gave orders to the children of Israel saying This is the land which is to be your heritage by the decision of the Lord which by the Lords order is to be given to the nine tribes and the halftribe
Num  For the tribe of the children of Reuben by their fathers families and the tribe of the children of Gad by their fathers families and the halftribe of Manasseh have been given their heritage
Num  The two tribes and the halftribe have been given their heritage on the other side of Jordan at Jericho on the east looking to the dawn
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  These are the names of the men who are to make the distribution of the land among you Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun
Num  And you are to take one chief from every tribe to make the distribution of the land
Num  And these are the names of the men of the tribe of Judah Caleb the son of Jephunneh
Num  And of the tribe of the children of Simeon Shemuel the son of Ammihud
Num  Of the tribe of Benjamin Elidad the son of Chislon
Num  And of the tribe of the children of Dan a chief Bukki the son of Jogli
Num  Of the children of Joseph of the tribe of the children of Manasseh a chief Hanniel the son of Ephod
Num  And of the tribe of the children of Ephraim a chief Kemuel the son of Shiphtan
Num  And of the tribe of the children of Zebulun a chief Elizaphan the son of Parnach
Num  And of the tribe of the children of Issachar a chief Paltiel the son of Azzan
Num  And of the tribe of the children of Asher a chief Ahihud the son of Shelomi
Num  And of the tribe of the children of Naphtali a chief Pedahel the son of Ammihud
Num  These are they to whom the Lord gave orders to make the distribution of the heritage among the children of Israel in the land of Canaan
Num  And the Lord said to Moses in the lowlands of Moab by Jordan at Jericho
Num  Give orders to the children of Israel to give to the Levites from the heritage which is theirs towns for themselves with land on the outskirts of the towns
Num  These towns are to be their livingplaces with land round them for their cattle and their food and all their beasts
Num  Stretching from the wall of the towns a distance of a thousand cubits all round
Num  The measure of this space of land is to be two thousand cubits outside the town on the east and two thousand cubits on the south and on the west and on the north the town being in the middle This space will be the outskirts of their towns
Num  And the towns which you give the Levites are to be the six safe places to which the taker of life may go in flight and in addition you are to give them fortytwo towns
Num  Fortyeight towns are to be given to the Levites all with land round them
Num  And these towns are to be given out of the heritage of the children of Israel taking the greater number from those who have much and a smaller number from those who have little everyone in the measure of his heritage is to give of his property to the Levites
Num  And the Lord said to Moses
Num  Say to the children of Israel when you have gone over Jordan into the land of Canaan
Num  Then let certain towns be marked out as safe places to which anyone who takes the life of another in error may go in flight
Num  In these towns you may be safe from him who has the right of punishment so that death may not overtake the taker of life till he has been judged by the meeting of the people
Num  Six of the towns which you give will be such safe places
Num  Three on the other side of Jordan and three in the land of Canaan to be safe places for flight
Num  For the children of Israel and for the man from another country who is living among them these six towns are to be safe places where anyone causing the death of another through error may go in flight
Num  But if a man gives another man a blow with an iron instrument causing his death he is a taker of life and is certainly to be put to death
Num  Or if he gives him a blow with a stone in his hand causing his death he is a taker of life and is certainly to be put to death
Num  Or if he gave him blows with a wood instrument in his hands causing his death he is a taker of life and is certainly to be put to death
Num  He whose right it is to give punishment for blood may himself put to death the taker of life when he comes face to face with him
Num  If in his hate he put a sword through him or waiting secretly for him sent a spear or stone at him causing his death
Num  Or in hate gave him blows with his hand causing death he who gave the deathblow is to be put to death he is a taker of life he whose right it is to give punishment for blood may put to death the taker of life when he comes face to face with him
Num  But if a man has given a wound to another suddenly and not in hate or without design has sent something against him
Num  Or has given him a blow with a stone without seeing him so causing his death though he had nothing against him and no desire to do him evil
Num  Then let the meeting of the people be judge between the man responsible for the death and him who has the right of punishment for blood acting by these rules
Num  And let the people keep the man responsible for the death safe from the hands of him who has the right of punishment for blood and send him back to his safe town where he had gone in flight there let him be till the death of the high priest who was marked with the holy oil
Num  But if ever he goes outside the walls of the safe town where he had gone in flight
Num  And the giver of punishment meeting him outside the walls of the town puts him to death he will not be responsible for his blood
Num  Because he had been ordered to keep inside the safe town till the death of the high priest but after the death of the high priest the taker of life may come back to the place of his heritage
Num  These rules are to be your guide in judging through all your generations wherever you may be living
Num  Anyone causing the death of another is himself to be put to death on the word of witnesses but the word of one witness is not enough
Num  Further no price may be given for the life of one who has taken life and whose right reward is death he is certainly to be put to death
Num  And no price may be offered for one who has gone in flight to a safe town for the purpose of letting him come back to his place before the death of the high priest
Num  So do not make the land where you are living unholy for blood makes the land unholy and there is no way of making the land free from the blood which has come on it but only by the death of him who was the cause of it
Num  Do not make unclean the land where you are living and in which is my House for I the Lord am present among the children of Israel
Num  Now the heads of the families of the children of Gilead the son of Machir the son of Manasseh of the families of the sons of Joseph came to Moses the chiefs and the heads of families of the children of Israel being present
Num  And said The Lord gave orders to my lord to make distribution of the land as their heritage to the children of Israel and my lord was ordered by the Lord to give the heritage of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters
Num  Now if they get married to any of the sons of other tribes of the children of Israel then their property will be taken away from the heritage of our fathers and become part of the heritage of the tribe into which they get married and their heritage will be taken away from the heritage of our tribe
Num  And at the time of the Jubilee of the children of Israel their property will be joined to the heritage of the tribe of which they are part and will be taken away from the heritage of the tribe of our fathers
Num  So by the direction of the Lord Moses gave orders to the children of Israel saying What the tribe of the sons of Joseph have said is right
Num  This is the order of the Lord about the daughters of Zelophehad The Lord says Let them take as their husbands whoever is most pleasing to them but only among the family of their fathers tribe
Num  And so no property will be handed from tribe to tribe among the children of Israel but every one of the children of Israel will keep the heritage of his fathers tribe
Num  And every daughter owning property in any tribe of the children of Israel is to be married to one of the family of her fathers tribe so that every man of the children of Israel may keep the heritage of his fathers
Num  And no property will be handed from one tribe to another but every tribe of the children of Israel will keep its heritage
Num  So the daughters of Zelophehad did as the Lord gave orders to Moses
Num  For Mahlah Tirzah and Hoglah and Milcah and Noah the daughters of Zelophehad took as their husbands the sons of their fathers brothers
Num  And were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph and their property was kept in the tribe of their fathers family
Num  These are the laws and the orders which the Lord gave to the children of Israel by Moses in the lowlands of Moab by Jordan at Jericho
Deu  These are the words which Moses said to all Israel on the far side of Jordan in the waste land in the Arabah opposite Suph between Paran on the one side and Tophel Laban Hazeroth and Dizahab on the other
Deu  It is eleven days journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadeshbarnea
Deu  Now in the fortieth year on the first day of the eleventh month Moses gave to the children of Israel all the orders which the Lord had given him for them
Deu  After he had overcome Sihon king of the Amorites ruling in Heshbon and Og king of Bashan ruling in Ashtaroth at Edrei
Deu  On the far side of Jordan in the land of Moab Moses gave the people this law saying
Deu  The Lord our God said to us in Horeb You have been long enough in this mountain
Deu  Make a move now and go on your way into the hillcountry of the Amorites and the places near it in the Arabah and the hillcountry and in the lowlands and in the South and by the seaside all the land of the Canaanites and Lebanon as far as the great river the river Euphrates
Deu  See all the land is before you go in and take for yourselves the land which the Lord gave by an oath to your fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob and to their seed after them
Deu  At that time I said to you I am not able to undertake the care of you by myself
Deu  The Lord your God has given you increase and now you are like the stars of heaven in number
Deu  May the Lord the God of your fathers make you a thousand times greater in number than you are and give you his blessing as he has said
Deu  How is it possible for me by myself to be responsible for you and undertake the weight of all your troubles and your arguments
Deu  Take for yourselves men who are wise farseeing and respected among you from your tribes and I will make them rulers over you
Deu  And you made answer and said to me It is good for us to do as you say
Deu  So I took the heads of your tribes wise men and respected and made them rulers over you captains of thousands and captains of hundreds and captains of fifties and captains of tens and overseers of your tribes
Deu  And at that time I gave orders to your judges saying Let all questions between your brothers come before you for hearing and give decisions uprightly between a man and his brother or one from another nation who is with him
Deu  In judging do not let a mans position have any weight with you give hearing equally to small and great have no fear of any man for it is God who is judge and any cause in which you are not able to give a decision you are to put before me and I will give it a hearing
Deu  And at that time I gave you all the orders which you were to do
Deu  Then we went on from Horeb through all that great and cruel waste which you saw on our way to the hillcountry of the Amorites as the Lord gave us orders and we came to Kadeshbarnea
Deu  And I said to you You have come to the hillcountry of the Amorites which the Lord our God is giving us
Deu  See now the Lord your God has put the land into your hands go up and take it as the Lord the God of your fathers has said to you have no fear and do not be troubled
Deu  And you came near to me every one of you and said Let us send men before us to go through the land with care and give us an account of the way we are to go and the towns to which we will come
Deu  And what you said seemed good to me and I took twelve men from among you one from every tribe
Deu  And they went up into the hillcountry and came to the valley of Eshcol and saw what was there
Deu  And taking in their hands some of the fruit of the land they came down again to us and gave us their account saying It is a good land which the Lord our God is giving us
Deu  But going against the order of the Lord your God you would not go up
Deu  And you made an angry outcry in your tents and said In his hate for us the Lord has taken us out of the land of Egypt to give us up into the hands of the Amorites for our destruction
Deu  Where are we going up Our brothers have made our hearts feeble with fear by saying The people are greater and taller than we are and the towns are great and walled up to heaven and more than this we have seen the sons of the Anakim there
Deu  Then I said to you Have no fear of them
Deu  The Lord your God who goes before you will be fighting for you and will do such wonders as he did for you in Egypt before your eyes
Deu  And in the waste land where you have seen how the Lord was supporting you as a man does his son in all your journeying till you came to this place
Deu  But for all this you had no faith in the Lord your God
Deu  Who goes before you on your way looking for a place where you may put up your tents in fire by night lighting up the way you are to go and in a cloud by day
Deu  And the Lord hearing your words was angry and said with an oath
Deu  Truly not one of this evil generation will see that good land which I said I would give to your fathers
Deu  But only Caleb the son of Jephunneh he will see it and to him and to his children I will give the land over which his feet have gone because he has been true to the Lord with all his heart
Deu  And in addition the Lord was angry with me because of you saying You yourself will not go into it
Deu  Joshua the son of Nun your servant he will go into the land say to him that he is to be strong for he will be Israels guide into their heritage
Deu  And your little ones who you said would come into strange hands your children who now have no knowledge of good or evil they will go into that land and to them I will give it and it will be theirs
Deu  But as for you go back journeying into the waste land by the way of the Red Sea
Deu  Then you said to me We have done evil against the Lord we will go up to the attack as the Lord our God has given us orders And arming yourselves every one you made ready to go up without care into the hillcountry
Deu  And the Lord said to me Say to them Do not go up to the attack for I am not among you and you will be overcome by those who are against you
Deu  This I said to you but you gave no attention and went against the orders of the Lord and in your pride went up into the hillcountry
Deu  And the Amorites who were in the hillcountry came out against you and put you to flight rushing after you like bees and overcame you in Seir driving you even as far as Hormah
Deu  And you came back weeping before the Lord but the Lord gave no attention to your cries and did not give ear to you
Deu  So you were kept waiting in Kadesh for a long time
Deu  Then we went back journeying into the waste land by the way to the Red Sea as the Lord had said to me and we were a long time going round Mount Seir
Deu  And the Lord said to me
Deu  You have been journeying round this mountain long enough now go to the north
Deu  And give the people orders saying You are about to go through the land of your brothers the children of Esau who are living in Seir and they will have fear of you so take care what you do
Deu  Make no attack on them for I will not give you any of their land not even space enough for a mans foot because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for his heritage
Deu  You may get food for your needs from them for a price and water for drinking
Deu  For the blessing of the Lord your God has been on you in all the work of your hands he has knowledge of your wanderings through this great waste these forty years the Lord your God has been with you and you have been short of nothing
Deu  So we went on past our brothers the children of Esau living in Seir by the road through the Arabah from Elath and Eziongeber And turning we went by the road through the waste land of Moab
Deu  And the Lord said to me Make no attack on Moab and do not go to war with them for I will not give you any of his land because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for their heritage
Deu  In the past the Emim were living there a great people equal in numbers to the Anakim and as tall
Deu  They are numbered among the Rephaim like the Anakim but are named Emim by the Moabites
Deu  And the Horites in earlier times were living in Seir but the children of Esau took their place they sent destruction on them and took their land for themselves as Israel did to the land of his heritage which the Lord gave them
Deu  Get up now and go over the stream Zered So we went over the stream Zered
Deu  Thirtyeight years had gone by from the time when we came away from Kadeshbarnea till we went over the stream Zered by that time all the generation of the men of war among us were dead as the Lord had said
Deu  For the hand of the Lord was against them working their destruction till all were dead
Deu  So when death had overtaken all the men of war among the people
Deu  The word of the Lord came to me saying
Deu  You are about to go by Ar the limit of the country of Moab
Deu  And when you come near the land of the children of Ammon give them no cause of trouble and do not make war on them for I will not give you any of the land of the children of Ammon for your heritage because I have given it to the children of Lot
Deu  That land is said to have been a land of the Rephaim for Rephaim had been living there in earlier times but they were named Zamzummim by the Ammonites
Deu  They were a great people tall as the Anakim and equal to them in number but the Lord sent destruction on them and the children of Ammon took their place living in their land
Deu  As he did for the children of Esau living in Seir when he sent destruction on the Horites before them and they took their land where they are living to this day
Deu  And the Avvim living in the small towns as far as Gaza came to destruction by the hands of the Caphtorim who came out from Caphtor and took their land
Deu  Get up now and go on your journey crossing over the valley of the Arnon see I have given into your hands Sihon the Amorite king of Heshbon and all his land go forward to make it yours and make war on him
Deu  From now on I will put the fear of you in all peoples under heaven who hearing of you will be shaking with fear and grief of heart because of you
Deu  Then from the waste land of Kedemoth I sent representatives to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace saying
Deu  Let me go through your land I will keep to the highway not turning to the right or to the left
Deu  Let me have food at a price for my needs and water for drinking only let me go through on foot
Deu  As the children of Esau did for me in Seir and the Moabites in Ar till I have gone over Jordan into the land which the Lord our God is giving us
Deu  But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us go through for the Lord your God made his spirit hard and his heart strong so that he might give him up into your hands as at this day
Deu  And the Lord said to me See from now on I have given Sihon and his land into your hands go forward now to take his land and make it yours
Deu  Then Sihon came out against us with all his people to make an attack on us at Jahaz
Deu  And the Lord our God gave him into our hands and we overcame him and his sons and all his people
Deu  At that time we took all his towns and gave them over to complete destruction together with men women and children we had no mercy on any
Deu  Only the cattle we took for ourselves with the goods from the towns we had taken
Deu  From Aroer on the edge of the valley of the Arnon and from the town in the valley as far as Gilead no town was strong enough to keep us out the Lord our God gave them all into our hands
Deu  But you did not go near the land of the children of Ammon that is all the side of the river Jabbok or the towns of the hillcountry wherever the Lord our God had said we were not to go
Deu  Then turning we took the road to Bashan and Og king of Bashan came out against us with all his people and made an attack on us at Edrei
Deu  And the Lord said to me Have no fear of him for I have given him and all his people and his land into your hands do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites who was ruling in Heshbon
Deu  So the Lord our God gave up Og king of Bashan and all his people into our hands and we overcame him so completely that all his people came to their end in the fight
Deu  At that time we took all his towns there was not one town of the sixty towns all the country of Argob the kingdom of Og in Bashan which we did not take
Deu  All these towns had high walls round them with doors and locks and in addition we took a great number of unwalled towns
Deu  And we put them to the curse every town together with men women and children
Deu  But we took for ourselves all the cattle and the stored wealth of the towns
Deu  At that time we took their land from the two kings of the Amorites on the far side of Jordan from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon
Deu  By the Sidonians Hermon is named Sirion and by the Amorites Shenir
Deu  All the towns of the tableland and all Gilead and Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei towns of the kingdom of Og in Bashan
Deu  For Og king of Bashan was the last of all the Rephaim his bed was made of iron is it not in Rabbah in the land of the children of Ammon It was nine cubits long and four cubits wide measured by the common cubit
Deu  And this land which we took at that time from Aroer by the valley of the Arnon and half the hillcountry of Gilead with its towns I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites
Deu  The rest of Gilead and all Bashan the kingdom of Og all the land of Argob together with Bashan I gave to the halftribe of Manasseh This land is named the land of the Rephaim
Deu  Jair the son of Manasseh took all the land of Argob as far as the country of the Geshurites and the Maacathites naming it Bashan HavvothJair after himself as it is to this day
Deu  And Gilead I gave to Machir
Deu  And the land from Gilead to the valley of the Arnon with the middle of the valley as a limit as far as the river Jabbok which is the limit of the country of the children of Ammon I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites
Deu  As well as the Arabah with the river Jordan as their limit from Chinnereth to the Salt Sea under the slopes of Pisgah to the east
Deu  At that time I gave you orders saying The Lord has given you this land for your heritage all the men of war are to go over armed before your brothers the children of Israel
Deu  But your wives and your little ones and your cattle for it is clear that you have much cattle may go on living in the towns I have given you
Deu  Till the Lord has given rest to your brothers as to you and till they have taken for themselves the land which the Lord your God is giving them on the other side of Jordan then you may go back every man of you to the heritage which I have given you
Deu  And I gave orders to Joshua at that time saying Your eyes have seen what the Lord your God has done to these two kings so will the Lord do to all the kingdoms into which you come
Deu  Have no fear of them for the Lord your God will be fighting for you
Deu  And at that time I made request to the Lord saying
Deu  O Lord God you have now for the first time let your servant see your great power and the strength of your hand for what god is there in heaven or on earth able to do such great works and such acts of power
Deu  Let me go over O Lord and see the good land on the other side of Jordan and that fair mountain country even Lebanon
Deu  But the Lord was angry with me because of you and would not give ear to my prayer and the Lord said to me Let it be enough say no more about this thing
Deu  Go up to the top of Pisgah and turning your eyes to the west and the north to the south and the east see the land with your eyes for you are not to go over Jordan
Deu  But give my orders to Joshua comforting him and making him strong for he is to go over Jordan at the head of this people and he will give them this land which you will see for their heritage
Deu  So we were waiting in the valley facing Bethpeor
Deu  And now give ear O Israel to the laws and the decisions which I am teaching you and do them so that life may be yours and you may go in and take for yourselves the land which the Lord the God of your fathers is giving you
Deu  Make no addition to the orders which I give you and take nothing from them but keep the orders of the Lord your God which I give you
Deu  Your eyes have seen what the Lord did because of Baalpeor for destruction came from the Lord on all those among you who went after Baalpeor
Deu  But you who kept faith with the Lord are living every one of you today
Deu  I have been teaching you laws and decisions as I was ordered to do by the Lord my God so that you might keep them in the land to which you are going to take it for your heritage
Deu  So keep these laws and do them for so will your wisdom and good sense be clear in the eyes of the peoples who hearing all these laws will say Truly this great nation is a wise and farseeing people
Deu  For what great nation has a god so near to them as the Lord our God is whenever we are turned to him in prayer
Deu  And what great nation has laws and decisions so right as all this law which I put before you today
Deu  Only take care and keep watch on your soul for fear that the things which your eyes have seen go from your memory and from your heart all the days of your life but let the knowledge of them be given to your children and to your childrens children
Deu  That day when you were waiting before the Lord your God in Horeb and the Lord said to me Make all the people come together so that hearing my words they may go in fear of me all the days of their life on earth and give this teaching to their children
Deu  And you came near waiting at the foot of the mountain and flames of fire went up from the mountain to the heart of heaven with dark clouds and all was black as night
Deu  And the voice of the Lord came to you out of the fire the sound of his words came to your ears but you saw no form there was nothing but a voice
Deu  And he gave you his agreement with you the ten rules which you were to keep which he put in writing on the two stones of the law
Deu  And the Lord gave me orders at that time to make clear to you these laws and decisions so that you might do them in the land to which you are going and which is to be your heritage
Deu  So keep watch on yourselves with care for you saw no form of any sort on the day when the voice of the Lord came to you in Horeb out of the heart of the fire
Deu  So that you may not be turned to evil ways and make for yourselves an image in the form of any living thing male or female
Deu  Or any beast of the earth or winged bird of the air
Deu  Or of anything which goes flat on the earth or any fish in the water under the earth
Deu  And when your eyes are lifted up to heaven and you see the sun and the moon and the stars all the army of heaven do not let yourselves be moved to give them worship or become the servants of what the Lord has given equally to all peoples under heaven
Deu  But the Lord has taken you out of the flaming fire out of Egypt to be to him the people of his heritage as you are today
Deu  And the Lord was angry with me because of you and made an oath that I was not to go over Jordan into the good land which the Lord is giving you for your heritage
Deu  But death is to come to me in this land I may not go over Jordan but you will go over and take that good land for your heritage
Deu  Take care that you do not let the agreement of the Lord your God which he has made with you go out of your mind or make for yourselves images of any sort against the orders which the Lord your God has given you
Deu  For the Lord your God is an allburning fire and he will not let the honour which is his be given to any other
Deu  If when you have had children and childrens children and have been living a long time in the land you are turned to evil ways and make an image of any sort and do evil in the eyes of the Lord your God moving him to wrath
Deu  May heaven and earth be my witnesses against you today that destruction will quickly overtake you cutting you off from that land which you are going over Jordan to take your days will not be long in that land but you will come to a complete end
Deu  And the Lord will send you wandering among the peoples only a small band of you will be kept from death among the nations where the Lord will send you
Deu  There you will be the servants of gods made by mens hands of wood and stone having no power of seeing or hearing or taking food or smelling
Deu  But if in those lands you are turned again to the Lord your God searching for him with all your heart and soul he will not keep himself from you
Deu  When you are in trouble and all these things have come on you if in the future you are turned again to the Lord your God and give ear to his voice
Deu  Because the Lord your God is a God of mercy he will not take away his help from you or let destruction overtake you or be false to the agreement which he made by an oath with your fathers
Deu  Give thought now to the days which are past before your time from the day when God first gave life to man on the earth and searching from one end of heaven to the other see if such a great thing as this has ever been or if anything like it has been talked of in story
Deu  Has any people ever gone on living after hearing the voice of God out of the heart of the fire as you did
Deu  Has God ever before taken a nation for himself from out of another nation by punishments and signs and wonders by war and by a strong hand and a stretchedout arm and great acts of wonder and fear as the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your very eyes
Deu  All this he let you see so that you might be certain that the Lord is God and there is no other
Deu  Out of heaven itself his voice came to you teaching you and on earth he let you see his great fire and his words came to your ears out of the heart of the fire
Deu  And because of his love for your fathers he took their seed and made it his and he himself present among you took you out of Egypt by his great power
Deu  Driving out before you nations greater and stronger than you to take you into their land and give it to you for your heritage as at this day
Deu  So today be certain and keep the knowledge deep in your hearts that the Lord is God in heaven on high and here on earth there is no other God
Deu  Then keep his laws and his orders which I give you today so that it may be well for you and for your children after you and that your lives may be long in the land which the Lord your God is giving you for ever
Deu  Then Moses had three towns marked out on the far side of Jordan looking to the east
Deu  To which anyone causing the death of his neighbour in error and not through hate might go in flight so that in one of these towns he might be kept from death
Deu  The names of the towns were Bezer in the waste land in the tableland for the Reubenites and Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites and Golan in Bashan for Manasseh
Deu  This is the law which Moses put before the children of Israel
Deu  These are the rules and the laws and the decisions which Moses gave to the children of Israel after they came out of Egypt
Deu  On the far side of Jordan in the valley facing Bethpeor in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites who was ruling in Heshbon whom Moses and the children of Israel overcame after they had come out of Egypt
Deu  And they took his land for a heritage and the land of Og king of Bashan the two kings of the Amorites whose lands were on the other side of Jordan to the east
Deu  From Aroer on the edge of the valley of the Arnon as far as Mount Sion which is Hermon
Deu  And all the Arabah on the far side of Jordan to the east as far as the sea of the Arabah under the slopes of Pisgah
Deu  And Moses sent for all Israel and said to them Give ear O Israel to the laws and the decisions which I give you today and give attention to them so that you may keep and do them
Deu  The Lord our God made an agreement with us in Horeb
Deu  The Lord did not make this agreement with our fathers but with us who are all living and present here today
Deu  The word of the Lord came to you face to face on the mountain out of the heart of the fire
Deu  I was between the Lord and you at that time to make clear to you the word of the Lord because through fear of the fire you did not go up the mountain saying
Deu  I am the Lord your God who took you out of the land of Egypt out of the prisonhouse
Deu  You are to have no other gods but me
Deu  You may not make for yourselves an image in the form of anything in heaven or on earth or in the waters under the earth
Deu  You may not go down on your faces before them or give them worship for I the Lord your God am a God who will not give his honour to another and I will send punishment on the children for the wrongdoing of their fathers to the third and fourth generation of my haters
Deu  And I will have mercy through a thousand generations on those who have love for me and keep my laws
Deu  You are not to make use of the name of the Lord your God for an evil purpose whoever takes the Lords name on his lips for an evil purpose will be judged as a sinner by the Lord
Deu  Keep the Sabbath day as a holy day as you have been ordered by the Lord your God
Deu  On six days do all your work
Deu  But the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God on that day do no work you or your son or your daughter or your manservant or your womanservant or your ox or your ass or any of your cattle or the man from a strange country who is living among you so that your manservant and your womanservant may have rest as well as you
Deu  And keep in mind that you were a servant in the land of Egypt and that the Lord your God took you out of that land by his strong hand and his stretchedout arm for this reason the Lord has given you orders to keep the Sabbath day
Deu  Give honour to your father and your mother as you have been ordered by the Lord your God so that your life may be long and all may be well for you in the land which the Lord your God is giving you
Deu  Do not put anyone to death without cause
Deu  Do not be false to the married relation
Deu  Do not take the property of another
Deu  Do not give false witness against your neighbour
Deu  Or let your desire be turned to your neighbours wife or his house or his field or his manservant or his womanservant or his ox or his ass or anything which is your neighbours
Deu  These words the Lord said to all of you together on the mountain out of the heart of the fire out of the cloud and the dark with a great voice and he said no more he put them in writing on the two stones of the law and gave them to me
Deu  And after hearing the voice which came out of the dark while the mountain was burning with fire all the heads of your tribes and your chiefs came to me
Deu  And said The Lord has let us see his glory and his power and his voice has come to us out of the fire today we have seen that a man may go on living even after hearing the voice of God
Deu  Why then is death to be our fate For if the voice of the Lord our God comes to us any more death will overtake us and we will be burned up in this great fire
Deu  For what man is there in all the earth who hearing the voice of the living God as we have out of the heart of the fire has been kept from death
Deu  Do you go near and after hearing everything which the Lord our God has to say give us an account of all he has said to you and we will give ear and do it
Deu  Then the Lord hearing your words to me said to me The words which this people have said to you have come to my ears what they have said is well said
Deu  If only they had such a heart in them at all times so that they might go in fear of me and keep my orders and that it might be well for them and for their children for ever
Deu  Now say to them Go back to your tents
Deu  But as for you keep your place here by me and I will give you all the orders and the laws and the decisions which you are to make clear to them so that they may do them in the land which I am giving them for their heritage
Deu  Take care then to do whatever the Lord your God has given you orders to do let there be no turning away to the right hand or to the left
Deu  Go on walking in the way ordered for you by the Lord your God so that life may be yours and it may be well for you and your days may be long in the land of your heritage
Deu  Now these are the orders and the laws and the decisions which the Lord your God gave me for your teaching so that you might do them in the land of your heritage to which you are going
Deu  So that living in the fear of the Lord your God you may keep all his laws and his orders which I give you you and your son and your sons son all the days of your life and so that your life may be long
Deu  So give ear O Israel and take care to do this so that it may be well for you and you may be greatly increased as the Lord the God of your fathers has given you his word in a land flowing with milk and honey
Deu  Give ear O Israel the Lord our God is one Lord
Deu  And the Lord your God is to be loved with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength
Deu  Keep these words which I say to you this day deep in your hearts
Deu  Teaching them to your children with all care talking of them when you are at rest in your house or walking by the way when you go to sleep and when you get up
Deu  Let them be fixed as a sign on your hand and marked on your brow
Deu  Have them lettered on the pillars of your houses and over the doors of your towns
Deu  And when the Lord your God has taken you into the land which he gave his oath to your fathers to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob that he would give you with great and fair towns which were not of your building
Deu  And houses full of good things not stored up by you and places for storing water which you did not make and vinegardens and olivetrees not of your planting and you have taken food and are full
Deu  Then take care that you keep your hearts true to the Lord who took you out of the land of Egypt out of the prisonhouse
Deu  Let the fear of the Lord your God be in your hearts and be his servants taking your oaths by his name
Deu  Do not go after other gods the gods of the peoples round about you
Deu  For the Lord your God who is with you is a God who will not let his honour be given to another or the wrath of the Lord will be burning against you causing your destruction from the face of the earth
Deu  Do not put the Lord your God to the test as you did in Massah
Deu  Keep with care the orders of the Lord your God and his rules and his laws which he has given you
Deu  And do what is upright and good in the eyes of the Lord your God so that it may be well for you and you may go in and take for your heritage that good land from which the Lord undertook by an oath to your fathers
Deu  To send out from before you all those who are against you
Deu  And when your son says to you in time to come What is the reason for these rules and laws and decisions which the Lord our God has given you
Deu  Then you will say to your son We were servants under Pharaohs yoke in Egypt and the Lord took us out of Egypt with a strong hand
Deu  And the Lord did great signs and wonders against Egypt and against Pharaoh and all his house before our eyes
Deu  And he took us out from that place guiding us here to give us this land as he said in his oath to our fathers
Deu  And the Lord gave us orders to keep all these laws in the fear of the Lord our God so that it might be well for us for ever and that he might keep us from death as he has done to this day
Deu  And it will be our righteousness if we take care to keep all this order before the Lord our God as he has given it to us
Deu  When the Lord your God takes you into the land where you are going which is to be your heritage and has sent out the nations before you the Hittites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites seven nations greater and stronger than you
Deu  And when the Lord has given them up into your hands and you have overcome them give them up to complete destruction make no agreement with them and have no mercy on them
Deu  Do not take wives or husbands from among them do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons
Deu  For through them your sons will be turned from me to the worship of other gods and the Lord will be moved to wrath against you and send destruction on you quickly
Deu  But this is what you are to do to them their altars are to be pulled down and their pillars broken and their holy trees cut down and their images burned with fire
Deu  For you are a holy people to the Lord your God marked out by the Lord your God to be his special people out of all the nations on the face of the earth
Deu  The Lord did not give you his love or take you for himself because you were more in number than any other people for you were the smallest of the nations
Deu  But because of his love for you and in order to keep his oath to your fathers the Lord took you out with the strength of his hand making you free from the prisonhouse and from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt
Deu  Be certain then that the Lord your God is God whose faith and mercy are unchanging who keeps his word through a thousand generations to those who have love for him and keep his laws
Deu  Rewarding his haters to their face with destruction he will have no mercy on his hater but will give him open punishment
Deu  So keep the orders and the laws and the decisions which I give you today and do them
Deu  And it will be that if you give attention to these decisions and keep and do them then the Lord will keep his agreement with you and his mercy as he said in his oath to your fathers
Deu  And he will give you his love blessing you and increasing you he will send his blessing on the offspring of your body and the fruit of your land your grain and your wine and your oil the increase of your cattle and the young of your flock in the land which by his oath to your fathers he undertook to give you
Deu  You will have greater blessings than any other people no male or female among you or among your cattle will be without offspring
Deu  And the Lord will take away from you all disease and will not put on you any of the evil diseases of Egypt which you have seen but will put them on your haters
Deu  And you are to send destruction on all the peoples which the Lord your God gives into your hands have no pity on them and do not give worship to their gods for that will be a cause of sin to you
Deu  If you say in your hearts These nations are greater in number than we are how are we to take their land from them
Deu  Have no fear of them but keep well in mind what the Lord your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt
Deu  The great punishments which your eyes saw and the signs and the wonders and the strong hand and the stretchedout arm by which the Lord your God took you out so will the Lord your God do to all the peoples who are the cause of your fears
Deu  And the Lord will send a hornet among them till all the rest who have kept themselves safe from you in secret places have been cut off
Deu  Have no fear of them for the Lord your God is with you a great God greatly to be feared
Deu  The Lord your God will send out the nations before you little by little they are not to be rooted out quickly for fear that the beasts of the field may be increased overmuch against you
Deu  But the Lord your God will give them up into your hands overpowering them till their destruction is complete
Deu  He will give their kings into your hands and you will put their names out of existence under heaven there is not one of them who will not give way before you till their destruction is complete
Deu  The images of their gods are to be burned with fire have no desire for the gold and silver on them and do not take it for yourselves for it will be a danger to you it is a thing disgusting to the Lord your God
Deu  And you may not take a disgusting thing into your house and so become cursed with its curse but keep yourselves from it turning from it with fear and hate for it is a cursed thing
Deu  Take care to keep all the orders which I give you today so that you may have life and be increased and go in and take as a heritage the land which the Lord by his oath to your fathers undertook to give you
Deu  And keep in mind the way by which the Lord your God has taken you through the waste land these forty years so that he might make low your pride and put you to the test to see what was in your heart and if you would keep his orders or not
Deu  And he made low your pride and let you be without food and gave you manna for your food a thing new to you which your fathers never saw so that he might make it clear to you that bread is not mans only need but his life is in every word which comes out of the mouth of the Lord
Deu  Through all these forty years your clothing did not get old or your feet become tired
Deu  Keep in mind this thought that as a son is trained by his father so you have been trained by the Lord your God
Deu  Then keep the orders of the Lord your God fearing him and walking in his ways
Deu  For the Lord your God is guiding you into a good land a land of watersprings of fountains and deep streams flowing out from the valleys and the hills
Deu  A land of grain and vines and figtrees and fair fruits a land of oilgiving olivetrees and honey
Deu  Where there will be bread for you in full measure and you will be in need of nothing a land where the very stones are iron and from whose hills you may get copper
Deu  And you will have food enough and be full praising the Lord your God for the good land he has given you
Deu  Then take care that you are not turned away from the Lord your God and from keeping his orders and decisions and laws which I give you this day
Deu  And when you have taken food and are full and have made fair houses for yourselves and are living in them
Deu  And when your herds and your flocks are increased and your stores of silver and gold and you have wealth of every sort
Deu  Take care that your hearts are not lifted up in pride giving no thought to the Lord your God who took you out of the land of Egypt out of the prisonhouse
Deu  Who was your guide through that great and cruel waste where there were poisonsnakes and scorpions and a dry land without water who made water come out of the hard rock for you
Deu  Who gave you manna for your food in the waste land a food which your fathers had never seen so that your pride might be broken and your hearts tested for your good in the end
Deu  Say not then in your hearts My power and the strength of my hands have got me this wealth
Deu  But keep in mind the Lord your God for it is he who gives you the power to get wealth so that he may give effect to the agreement which he made by his oath with your fathers as at this day
Deu  And it is certain that if at any time you are turned away from the Lord your God and go after other gods to be their servants and to give them worship destruction will overtake you
Deu  Like the nations which the Lord is cutting off before you so you will be cut off because you would not give ear to the voice of the Lord your God
Deu  Give ear O Israel today you are to go over Jordan to take the heritage of nations greater and stronger than yourselves and towns of great size with walls as high as heaven
Deu  A people great and tall the sons of the Anakim of whom you have knowledge and of whom it has been said All are forced to give way before the sons of Anak
Deu  Be certain then today that it is the Lord your God who goes over before you like an allburning fire he will send destruction on them crushing them before you and you will send them in flight putting an end to them quickly as the Lord has said
Deu  And after the Lord has sent them in flight from before you say not in your heart Because of my righteousness the Lord has given me this land when it is because of their evildoing that the Lord is driving these nations out before you
Deu  Not for your righteousness or because your hearts are upright are you going in to take their land but because of the evildoing of these nations the Lord your God is driving them out from before you and to give effect to his oath to your fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob
Deu  Be certain then that the Lord your God is not giving you this good land as a reward for your righteousness for you are a stiffnecked people
Deu  Keep well in mind how you made the Lord your God angry in the waste land from the day when you went out of Egypt till you came to this place you have gone against the orders of the Lord
Deu  Again in Horeb you made the Lord angry and in his wrath he would have put an end to you
Deu  When I had gone up into the mountain to be given the stones on which was recorded the agreement which the Lord made with you I was on the mountain for forty days and forty nights without taking food or drinking water
Deu  And the Lord gave me the two stones with writing on them done by the finger of God on them were recorded all the words which the Lord said to you on the mountain out of the heart of the fire on the day of the great meeting
Deu  Then at the end of forty days and forty nights the Lord gave me those stones the stones of the agreement
Deu  And the Lord said to me Get up now and go down quickly from this place for the people you have taken out of Egypt have given themselves over to evil they have quickly been turned from the way in which I gave them orders to go they have made themselves a metal image
Deu  And then the Lord said to me I have seen that this people is stiffnecked
Deu  Let me send destruction on them till their very name is cut off and I will make of you a nation greater and stronger than they
Deu  So turning round I came down from the mountain and the mountain was burning with fire and the two stones of the agreement were in my hands
Deu  And I saw that you had done evil against the Lord and had made for yourselves a metal image of a young ox you had quickly been turned from the way in which the Lord had given you orders to go
Deu  And I let the stones go from my hands and they were broken before your eyes
Deu  And I went down on my face before the Lord as at the first for forty days and forty nights without taking food or drinking water because of all your sin in doing evil in the eyes of the Lord and moving him to wrath
Deu  For I was full of fear because of the wrath of the Lord which was burning against you with your destruction in view But again the Lords ear was open to my prayer
Deu  And the Lord in his wrath would have put Aaron to death and I made prayer for Aaron at the same time
Deu  And I took your sin the image which you had made and put it in the fire and had it hammered and crushed very small till it was only dust and the dust I put in the stream flowing down from the mountain
Deu  Again at Taberah and at Massah and at Kibrothhattaavah you made the Lord angry
Deu  And when the Lord sent you from Kadeshbarnea saying Go up and take the land which I have given you you went against the orders of the Lord your God and had no faith in him and would not give ear to his voice
Deu  From the day when I first had knowledge of you you have gone against the word of the Lord
Deu  So I went down on my face in prayer before the Lord for forty days and forty nights as I did at first because the Lord had said that he would put an end to you
Deu  And I made prayer to the Lord and said O Lord God do not send destruction on your people and your heritage to whom by your great power you have given salvation whom you have taken out of Egypt by the strength of your hand
Deu  Keep in mind your servants Abraham Isaac and Jacob not looking at the hard heart of this people or their evildoing and their sin
Deu  Or it may be said in the land from which you have taken them Because the Lord was not able to take them into the land which he said he would give them and because of his hate for them he has taken them out to put them to death in the waste land
Deu  But still they are your people and your heritage whom you took out by your great power and by your stretchedout arm
Deu  At that time the Lord said to me Make two other stones cut like the first two and come up to me on the mountain and make an ark of wood
Deu  And I will put on the stones the words which were on the first stones which were broken by you and you are to put them into the ark
Deu  So I made an ark of hard wood and had two stones cut like the others and went up the mountain with the stones in my hands
Deu  And he put on the stones as in the first writing the ten rules which the Lord gave you on the mountain out of the fire on the day of the great meeting and the Lord gave the stones to me
Deu  And turning round I came down from the mountain and put the stones in the ark which I had made and there they are as the Lord gave me orders
Deu  And the children of Israel went on from Beeroth Benejaakan to Moserah there death came to Aaron and he was put to rest in the earth and Eleazar his son took his place as priest
Deu  From there they went on to Gudgodah and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah a land of streams of water
Deu  At that time the Lord had the tribe of Levi marked out to take up the ark of the Lords agreement to be before the Lord and to do his work and to give blessings in his name to this day
Deu  For this reason Levi has no part or heritage for himself among his brothers the Lord is his heritage as the Lord your God said to him
Deu  And I was in the mountain as at the first time for forty days and forty nights and again the ears of the Lord were open to my prayer and he did not send destruction on you
Deu  Then the Lord said to me Get up and go on your journey before the people so that they may go in and take the land which I said in my oath to their fathers that I would give them
Deu  And now Israel what would the Lord your God have you do but to go in the fear of the Lord your God walking in all his ways and loving him and doing his pleasure with all your heart and all your soul
Deu  Doing the orders of the Lord and keeping his laws which I give you this day for your good
Deu  The Lord your God is ruler of heaven of the heaven of heavens and of the earth with everything in it
Deu  But the Lord had delight in your fathers and love for them marking out for himself their seed after them even you from all peoples as at this day
Deu  Let your circumcision be of the heart and put away your pride
Deu  For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords the great God strong in power and greatly to be feared who has no respect for any mans position and takes no rewards
Deu  Judging uprightly in the cause of the widow and of the child who has no father and giving food and clothing in his mercy to the man from a strange country
Deu  So be kind to the man from a strange country who is living among you for you yourselves were living in a strange country in the land of Egypt
Deu  Let the fear of the Lord your God be before you give him worship and be true to him at all times taking your oaths in his name
Deu  He is your God the God of your praise your God who has done for you all these works of power which your eyes have seen
Deu  Your fathers went down into Egypt with seventy persons and now the Lord your God has made you like the stars of heaven in number
Deu  So have love for the Lord your God and give him worship and keep his laws and his decisions and his orders at all times
Deu  And be certain in your minds this day for these words are not said to your children who have had no experience of the training of the Lord your God and who have not seen his great power or his strong hand and his stretchedout arm
Deu  Or his signs and wonders which he did in Egypt to Pharaoh king of Egypt and all his land
Deu  And what he did to the army of Egypt to their horses and their warcarriages how he made the waters of the Red Sea come up over them when they went after you and how the Lord put an end to them even to this day
Deu  And what he did for you in the waste land till you came to this place
Deu  And what he did to Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab the son of Reuben when they went down into the open mouth of the earth with their families and their tents and every living thing which was theirs before the eyes of all Israel
Deu  But your eyes have seen all the great works of the Lord which he has done
Deu  So keep all the orders which I give you today so that you may be strong and go in and take the land which is to be your heritage
Deu  And that your days may be long in the land which the Lord gave by an oath to your fathers and to their seed after them a land flowing with milk and honey
Deu  For the land where you are going is not like the land of Egypt from which you have come where you put in your seeds watering them with your foot like a planted garden
Deu  But the land where you are going is a land of hills and valleys drinking in the rain of heaven
Deu  A land cared for by the Lord your God the eyes of the Lord your God are on it at all times from one end of the year to the other
Deu  And it will be that if you truly give ear to the orders which I put before you this day loving the Lord your God and worshipping him with all your heart and all your soul
Deu  Then I will send rain on your land at the right time the early rains and the late rains so that you may get in your grain and your wine and your oil
Deu  And I will give grass in your fields for your cattle so that you may have food in full measure
Deu  But take care that your hearts are not turned to false ways so that you become servants and worshippers of other gods
Deu  For if you do so the wrath of the Lord will be burning against you and the heaven will be shut up so that there is no rain and the land will give no fruit and in a very little time you will be cut off from the good land which the Lord is giving you
Deu  So keep these words deep in your heart and in your soul and have them fixed on your hand for a sign and marked on your brow
Deu  Teaching them to your children and talking of them when you are at rest in your house or walking by the way when you go to sleep and when you get up
Deu  Writing them on the pillars of your houses and over the doors of your towns
Deu  So that your days and the days of your children may be long in the land which the Lord by his oath to your fathers said he would give them like the days of the eternal heavens
Deu  For if you take care to keep all the orders which I give you and to do them loving the Lord your God and walking in all his ways and being true to him
Deu  Then the Lord will send these nations in flight before you and you will take the lands of nations greater and stronger than yourselves
Deu  Every place where you put your foot will be yours from the waste land and Lebanon from the river the river Euphrates as far as the Great Sea will be the limits of your land
Deu  All people will give way before you for the Lord your God will put the fear of you on all the land through which you go as he has said
Deu  Today I put before you a blessing and a curse
Deu  The blessing if you give ear to the orders of the Lord your God which I give you this day
Deu  And the curse if you do not give ear to the orders of the Lord your God but let yourselves be turned from the way which I have put before you this day and go after other gods which are not yours
Deu  And when the Lord your God has taken you into the land of your heritage you are to put the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal
Deu  Are they not on the other side of Jordan looking west in the land of the Canaanites living in the Arabah opposite Gilgal by the holy tree of Moreh
Deu  For you are about to go over Jordan to take the heritage which the Lord your God is giving you and it will be your restingplace
Deu  And you are to take care to keep all the laws and the decisions which I put before you today
Deu  These are the laws and the decisions which you are to keep with care in the land which the Lord the God of your fathers has given you to be your heritage all the days of your life on earth
Deu  You are to give up to the curse all those places where the nations whom you are driving out gave worship to their gods on the high mountains and the hills and under every green tree
Deu  Their altars and their pillars are to be broken down and their holy trees burned with fire and the images of their gods cut down you are to take away their names out of that place
Deu  Do not so to the Lord your God
Deu  But let your hearts be turned to the place which will be marked out by the Lord your God among your tribes to put his name there
Deu  And there you are to take your burned offerings and other offerings and the tenth part of your goods and the offerings to be lifted up to the Lord and the offerings of your oaths and those which you give freely from the impulse of your hearts and the first births among your herds and your flocks
Deu  There you and all your families are to make a feast before the Lord your God with joy in everything to which you put your hand because the Lord has given you his blessing
Deu  You are not to do things then in the way in which we now do them here every man as it seems right to him
Deu  For you have not come to the rest and the heritage which the Lord your God is giving you
Deu  But when you have gone over Jordan and are living in the land which the Lord your God is giving you as your heritage and when he has given you rest from all those on every side who are fighting against you and you are living there safely
Deu  Then there will be a place marked out by the Lord your God as the restingplace for his name and there you will take all the things which I give you orders to take your burned offerings and other offerings and the tenth part of your goods and the offerings to be lifted up and the offerings of your oaths which you make to the Lord
Deu  And you will be glad before the Lord your God you and your sons and your daughters and your menservants and your womenservants and the Levite who is with you in your house because he has no part or heritage among you
Deu  Take care that you do not make your burned offerings in any place you see
Deu  But in the place marked out by the Lord in one of your tribes there let your burned offerings be offered and there do what I have given you orders to do
Deu  Only you may put to death animals such as the gazelle or the roe for your food in any of your towns at the desire of your soul in keeping with the blessing of the Lord your God which he has given you the unclean and the clean may take of it
Deu  But you may not take the blood for food it is to be drained out on the earth like water
Deu  In your towns you are not to take as food the tenth part of your grain or of your wine or your oil or the first births of your herds or of your flocks or anything offered under an oath or freely offered to the Lord or given as a lifted offering
Deu  But they will be your food before the Lord your God in the place of his selection where you may make a feast of them with your son and your daughter and your manservant and your womanservant and the Levite who is living with you and you will have joy before the Lord your God in everything to which you put your hand
Deu  See that you do not give up caring for the Levite as long as you are living in your land
Deu  When the Lord your God makes wide the limit of your land as he has said and you say I will take flesh for my food because you have a desire for it then you may take whatever flesh you have a desire for
Deu  If the place marked out by the Lord your God as the restingplace for his name is far away from you then take from your herds and from your flocks which the Lord has given you as I have said and have a meal of it in the towns where you may be living
Deu  It will be your food like the gazelle and the roe the unclean and the clean may take of it
Deu  But see that you do not take the blood for food for the blood is the life and you may not make use of the life as food with the flesh
Deu  Do not take it for food but let it be drained out on the earth like water
Deu  Do not take it for food so that it may be well for you and for your children after you while you do what is right in the eyes of the Lord
Deu  But the holy things which you have and the offerings of your oaths you are to take to the place which will be marked out by the Lord
Deu  Offering the flesh and the blood of your burned offerings on the altar of the Lord your God and the blood of your offerings is to be drained out on the altar of the Lord your God and the flesh will be your food
Deu  Take note of all these orders I am giving you and give attention to them so that it may be well for you and for your children after you for ever while you do what is good and right in the eyes of the Lord your God
Deu  When the people of the land where you are going have been cut off before you by the Lord your God and you have taken their land and are living in it
Deu  After their destruction take care that you do not go in their ways and that you do not give thought to their gods saying How did these nations give worship to their gods I will do as they did
Deu  Do not so to the Lord your God for everything which is disgusting to the Lord and hated by him they have done in honour of their gods even burning their sons and daughters in the fire to their gods
Deu  You are to keep with care all the words I give you making no addition to them and taking nothing from them
Deu  If ever you have among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and he gives you a sign or a wonder
Deu  And the sign or the wonder takes place and he says to you Let us go after other gods which are strange to you and give them worship
Deu  Then give no attention to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams for the Lord your God is testing you to see if all the love of your heart and soul is given to him
Deu  But keep on in the ways of the Lord your God fearing him and keeping his orders and hearing his voice worshipping him and being true to him
Deu  And that prophet or that dreamer of dreams is to be put to death for his words were said with the purpose of turning you away from the Lord your God who took you out of the land of Egypt and made you free from the prisonhouse and of forcing you out of the way in which the Lord your God has given you orders to go So you are to put away the evil from among you
Deu  If your brother the son of your mother or your son or your daughter or the wife of your heart or the friend who is as dear to you as your life working on you secretly says to you Let us go and give worship to other gods strange to you and to your fathers
Deu  Gods of the peoples round about you near or far from one end of the earth to the other
Deu  Do not be guided by him or give attention to him have no pity on him or mercy and give him no cover
Deu  But put him to death without question let your hand be the first stretched out against him to put him to death and then the hands of all the people
Deu  Let him be stoned with stones till he is dead because it was his purpose to make you false to the Lord your God who took you out of the land of Egypt out of the prisonhouse
Deu  And all Israel hearing of it will be full of fear and no one will again do such evil as this among you
Deu  And if word comes to you in one of the towns which the Lord your God is giving you for your restingplace
Deu  That goodfornothing persons have gone out from among you turning the people of their town from the right way and saying Let us go and give worship to other gods of whom you have no knowledge
Deu  Then let a full search be made and let questions be put with care and if it is true and certain that such a disgusting thing has been done among you
Deu  Then take up arms against the people of that town and give it up to the curse with all its cattle and everything in it
Deu  And take all the goods into the middle of its open space burning the town and all its property with fire as an offering to the Lord your God it is to be a waste for ever there is to be no more building there
Deu  Keep not a thing of what is cursed for yourselves so the Lord may be turned away from the heat of his wrath and have mercy on you and give you increase as he said in his oath to your fathers
Deu  So long as you give ear to the voice of the Lord your God and keep all his orders which I give you today and do what is right in the eyes of the Lord your God
Deu  You are the children of the Lord your God you are not to make cuts on your bodies or take off the hair on your brows in honour of the dead
Deu  For you are a holy people to the Lord your God and the Lord has taken you to be his special people out of all the nations on the face of the earth
Deu  No disgusting thing may be your food
Deu  These are the beasts which you may have for food the ox the sheep and the goat
Deu  The hart the gazelle and the roe the mountain goat and the pygarg and the antelope and the mountain sheep
Deu  Any beast which has a division in the horn of its foot and whose food comes back into its mouth to be crushed again may be used for food
Deu  But even among these there are some which may not be used for food such as the camel the hare and the coney which are unclean to you because though their food comes back the horn of their feet is not parted in two
Deu  And the pig is unclean to you because though it has a division in the horn of its foot its food does not come back their flesh may not be used for food or their dead bodies touched by you
Deu  And of the things living in the waters you may take all those who have wings for swimming with and skins formed of thin plates
Deu  But any which have no skinplates or wings for swimming you may not take they are unclean for you
Deu  All clean birds may be used for food
Deu  But these birds you may not take the eagle and the giereagle and the ospray
Deu  The falcon and the kite and birds of that sort
Deu  Every raven and all birds of that sort
Deu  And the ostrich and the nighthawk and the seahawk and birds of that sort
Deu  The little owl and the great owl and the waterhen
Deu  And the pelican and the vulture and the cormorant
Deu  The stork and the heron and birds of that sort and the hoopoe and the bat
Deu  Every winged thing which goes flat on the earth is unclean to you and may not be used as food
Deu  But all clean birds you may take
Deu  You may not have as food anything which has come to a natural death the man from another country who is living with you may take it for food or you may get a price for it from one of another nation for you are a holy people to the Lord your God The young goat is not to be cooked in its mothers milk
Deu  Put on one side a tenth of all the increase of your seed produced year by year
Deu  And make a feast before the Lord your God in the place which is to be marked out where his name will be for ever of the tenth part of your grain and your wine and your oil and the first births of your herds and your flocks so that you may have the fear of the Lord your God in your hearts at all times
Deu  And if the way is so long that you are not able to take these things to the place marked out by the Lord your God for his name when he has given you his blessing because it is far away from you
Deu  Then let these things be exchanged for money and taking the money in your hand go to the place marked out by the Lord your God for himself
Deu  And with the money get whatever you have a desire for oxen or sheep or wine or strong drink whatever your souls desire may be and make a feast there before the Lord your God and be glad you and all your house
Deu  And give a thought to the Levite who is living among you for he has no part or heritage in the land
Deu  At the end of every three years take a tenth part of all your increase for that year and put it in store inside your walls
Deu  And the Levite because he has no part or heritage in the land and the man from a strange country and the child who has no father and the widow who are living among you will come and take food and have enough and so the blessing of the Lord your God will be on you in everything you do
Deu  At the end of every seven years there is to be a general forgiveness of debt
Deu  This is how it is to be done every creditor is to give up his right to whatever he has let his neighbour have he is not to make his neighbour his countryman give it back because a general forgiveness has been ordered by the Lord
Deu  A man of another nation may be forced to make payment of his debt but if your brother has anything of yours let it go
Deu  But there will be no poor among you for the Lord will certainly give you his blessing in the land which the Lord your God is giving you for your heritage
Deu  If only you give ear to the voice of the Lord your God and take care to keep all these orders which I give you today
Deu  For the Lord your God will give you his blessing as he has said you will let other nations have the use of your money but you will not make use of theirs you will be rulers over a number of nations but they will not be your rulers
Deu  If in any of your towns in the land which the Lord your God is giving you there is a poor man one of your countrymen do not let your heart be hard or your hand shut to him
Deu  But let your hand be open to give him the use of whatever he is in need of
Deu  And see that there is no evil thought in your heart moving you to say to yourself The seventh year the year of forgiveness is near and so looking coldly on your poor countryman you give him nothing and he will make an outcry to the Lord against you and it will be judged as sin in you
Deu  But it is right for you to give to him without grief of heart for because of this the blessing of the Lord your God will be on all your work and on everything to which you put your hand
Deu  For there will never be a time when there are no poor in the land and so I give orders to you Let your hand be open to your countrymen to those who are poor and in need in your land
Deu  If one of your countrymen a Hebrew man or woman becomes your servant for a price and does work for you six years in the seventh year let him go free
Deu  And when you make him free do not let him go away with nothing in his hands
Deu  But give him freely from your flock and from your grain and your wine in the measure of the wealth which the Lord your God has given you you are to give to him
Deu  And keep in mind that you yourself were a servant in the land of Egypt and the Lord your God made you free so I give you this order today
Deu  But if he says to you I have no desire to go away from you because you and your family are dear to him and he is happy with you
Deu  Then take a sharppointed instrument driving it through his ear into the door and he will be your servant for ever And you may do the same for your servantgirl
Deu  Let it not seem hard to you that you have to send him away free for he has been working for you for six years which is twice the regular time for a servant and the blessing of the Lord your God will be on you in everything you do
Deu  All the first males to come to birth in your herd and your flock are to be holy to the Lord your God the first birth of your ox is not to be used for work the wool of your first lamb is not to be cut
Deu  But year by year you and all your house are to take a meal of it before the Lord in the place of his selection
Deu  But if it has any mark on it if it is blind or has damaged legs or if there is anything wrong with it it may not be offered to the Lord your God
Deu  It may be used for food in your houses the unclean and the clean may take of it as of the gazelle and the roe
Deu  Only do not take its blood for food but let it be drained out on the earth like water
Deu  Take note of the month of Abib and keep the Passover to the Lord your God for in the month of Abib the Lord your God took you out of Egypt by night
Deu  The Passover offering from your flock or your herd is to be given to the Lord your God in the place marked out by him as the restingplace of his name
Deu  Take no leavened bread with it for seven days let your food be unleavened bread that is the bread of sorrow for you came out of the land of Egypt quickly so the memory of that day when you came out of the land of Egypt will be with you all your life
Deu  For seven days let no leaven be used through all your land and nothing of the flesh which is put to death in the evening of the first day is to be kept through the night till morning
Deu  The Passover offering is not to be put to death in any of the towns which the Lord your God gives you
Deu  But in the place marked out by the Lord your God as the restingplace of his name there you are to put the Passover to death in the evening at sundown at that time of the year when you came out of Egypt
Deu  It is to be cooked and taken as food in the place marked out by the Lord and in the morning you are to go back to your tents
Deu  For six days let your food be unleavened bread and on the seventh day there is to be a holy meeting to the Lord your God no work is to be done
Deu  Let seven weeks be numbered from the first day when the grain is cut
Deu  Then keep the feast of weeks to the Lord your God with an offering freely given to him from the wealth he has given you
Deu  Then you are to be glad before the Lord your God you and your son and your daughter your manservant and your womanservant and the Levite who is with you and the man from a strange country and the child without a father and the widow who are living among you in the place marked out by the Lord your God as a restingplace for his name
Deu  And you will keep in mind that you were a servant in the land of Egypt and you will take care to keep all these laws
Deu  You are to keep the feast of tents for seven days after you have got in all your grain and made your wine
Deu  You are to keep the feast with joy you and your son and your daughter your manservant and your womanservant and the Levite and the man from a strange country and the child without a father and the widow who are living among you
Deu  Keep the feast to the Lord your God for seven days in the place marked out by the Lord because the blessing of the Lord your God will be on all the produce of your land and all the work of your hands and you will have nothing but joy
Deu  Three times in the year let all your males come before the Lord your God in the place named by him at the feast of unleavened bread the feast of weeks and the feast of tents and they are not to come before the Lord with nothing in their hands
Deu  Every man is to give as he is able in the measure of the blessing which the Lord your God has given you
Deu  You are to make judges and overseers in all your towns which the Lord your God gives you for every tribe and they are to be upright men judging the people in righteousness
Deu  You are not to be moved in your judging by a mans position you are not to take rewards for rewards make the eyes of the wise man blind and the decisions of the upright false
Deu  Let righteousness be your guide so that you may have life and take for your heritage the land which the Lord your God is giving you
Deu  Let no holy tree of any sort be planted by the altar of the Lord your God which you will make
Deu  You are not to put up stone pillars for they are hated by the Lord your God
Deu  No ox or sheep which has a mark on it or is damaged in any way may be offered to the Lord your God for that is disgusting to the Lord your God
Deu  If there is any man or woman among you in any of the towns which the Lord your God gives you who does evil in the eyes of the Lord your God sinning against his agreement
Deu  By becoming a servant of other gods and worshipping them or the sun or the moon or all the stars of heaven against my orders
Deu  If word of this comes to your ears then let this thing be looked into with care and if there is no doubt that it is true and such evil has been done in Israel
Deu  Then you are to take the man or woman who has done the evil to the public place of your town and they are to be stoned with stones till they are dead
Deu  On the word of two or three witnesses a man may be given the punishment of death but he is not to be put to death on the word of one witness
Deu  The hands of the witnesses will be the first to put him to death and after them the hands of all the people So you are to put away the evil from among you
Deu  If you are not able to give a decision as to who is responsible for a death or who is right in a cause or who gave the first blow in a fight and there is a division of opinion about it in your town then go to the place marked out by the Lord your God
Deu  And come before the priests the Levites or before him who is judge at the time and they will go into the question and give you a decision
Deu  And you are to be guided by the decision they give in the place named by the Lord and do whatever they say
Deu  Acting in agreement with their teaching and the decision they give not turning to one side or the other from the word they have given you
Deu  And any man who in his pride will not give ear to the priest whose place is there before the Lord your God or to the judge is to be put to death you are to put away the evil from Israel
Deu  And all the people hearing of it will be full of fear and put away their pride
Deu  When you have come into the land which the Lord your God is giving you and have taken it for a heritage and are living in it if it is your desire to have a king over you like the other nations round about you
Deu  Then see that you take as your king the man named by the Lord your God let your king be one of your countrymen not a man of another nation who is not one of yourselves
Deu  And he is not to get together a great army of horses for himself or make the people go back to Egypt to get horses for him because the Lord has said You will never again go back that way
Deu  And he is not to have a great number of wives for fear that his heart may be turned away or great wealth of silver and gold
Deu  And when he has taken his place on the seat of his kingdom he is to make in a book a copy of this law from that which the priests the Levites have in their care
Deu  And it is to be with him for his reading all the days of his life so that he may be trained in the fear of the Lord his God to keep and do all the words of this teaching and these laws
Deu  So that his heart may not be lifted up over his countrymen and he may not be turned away from the orders to one side or the other but that his life and the lives of his children may be long in his kingdom in Israel
Deu  The priests the Levites that is all the tribe of Levi will have no part or heritage with Israel their food and their heritage will be the offerings of the Lord made by fire
Deu  And they will have no heritage among their countrymen the Lord is their heritage as he has said to them
Deu  And this is to be the priests right those who make an offering of a sheep or an ox are to give to the priest the top part of the leg and the two sides of the head and the stomach
Deu  And in addition you are to give him the first of your grain and wine and oil and the first wool cut from your sheep
Deu  For he and his sons after him for ever have been marked out by the Lord your God from all your tribes to do the work of priests in the name of the Lord
Deu  And if a Levite moved by a strong desire comes from any town in all Israel where he is living to the place marked out by the Lord
Deu  Then he will do the work of a priest in the name of the Lord his God with all his brothers the Levites who are there before the Lord
Deu  His food will be the same as theirs in addition to what has come to him as the price of his property
Deu  When you have come into the land which the Lord your God is giving you do not take as your example the disgusting ways of those nations
Deu  Let there not be seen among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter go through the fire or anyone using secret arts or a maker of strange sounds or a reader of signs or any wonderworker
Deu  Or anyone using secret force on people or putting questions to a spirit or having secret knowledge or going to the dead for directions
Deu  For all who do such things are disgusting to the Lord and because of these disgusting things the Lord your God is driving them out before you
Deu  You are to be upright in heart before the Lord your God
Deu  For these nations whose land you are taking give attention to readers of signs and to those using secret arts but the Lord your God will not let you do so
Deu  The Lord your God will give you a prophet from among your people like me you will give ear to him
Deu  In answer to the request you made to the Lord your God in Horeb on the day of the great meeting when you said Let not the voice of the Lord my God come to my ears again and let me not see this great fire any more or death will overtake me
Deu  Then the Lord said to me What they have said is well said
Deu  I will give them a prophet from among themselves like you and I will put my words in his mouth and he will say to them whatever I give him orders to say
Deu  And whoever does not give ear to my words which he will say in my name will be responsible to me
Deu  But the prophet who takes it on himself to say words in my name which I have not given him orders to say or who says anything in the name of other gods will come to his death
Deu  And if you say in your hearts How are we to be certain that the word does not come from the Lord
Deu  When a prophet makes a statement in the name of the Lord if what he says does not take place and his words do not come true then his word is not the word of the Lord the words of the prophet were said in the pride of his heart and you are to have no fear of him
Deu  When the nations whose land the Lord your God is giving you have been cut off by him and you have taken their place and are living in their towns and in their houses
Deu  You are to have three towns marked out in the land which the Lord your God is giving you for your heritage
Deu  You are to make ready a way and see that the land which the Lord your God is giving you for your heritage is marked out into three parts to which any taker of life may go in flight
Deu  This is to be the rule for anyone who goes in flight there after causing the death of his neighbour in error and not through hate
Deu  For example if a man goes into the woods with his neighbour for the purpose of cutting down trees and when he takes his axe to give a blow to the tree the head of the axe comes off and falling on to his neighbour gives him a wound causing his death then the man may go in flight to one of these towns and be safe
Deu  For if not he who has the right of punishment may go running after the taker of life in the heat of his wrath and overtake him because the way is long and give him a deathblow though it is not right for him to be put to death because he was not moved by hate
Deu  And so I am ordering you to see that three towns are marked out for this purpose
Deu  And if the Lord your God makes wide the limits of your land as he said in his oath to your fathers and gives you all the land which he undertook to give to your fathers
Deu  If you keep and do all these orders which I give you today loving the Lord your God and walking ever in his ways then let three more towns in addition to these three be marked out for you
Deu  So that in all your land which the Lord your God is giving you for your heritage no man may be wrongly put to death for which you will be responsible
Deu  But if any man has hate for his neighbour and waiting for him secretly makes an attack on him and gives him a blow causing his death and then goes in flight to one of these towns
Deu  The responsible men of his town are to send and take him and give him up to the one who has the right of punishment to be put to death
Deu  Have no pity on him so that Israel may be clear from the crime of putting a man to death without cause and it will be well for you
Deu  Your neighbours landmark which was put in its place by the men of old times is not to be moved or taken away in the land of your heritage which the Lord your God is giving you
Deu  One witness may not make a statement against a man in relation to any sin or wrongdoing which he has done on the word of two or three witnesses a question is to be judged
Deu  If a false witness makes a statement against a man saying that he has done wrong
Deu  Then the two men between whom the argument has taken place are to come before the Lord before the priests and judges who are then in power
Deu  And the judges will have the question looked into with care and if the witness is seen to be false and to have made a false statement against his brother
Deu  Then do to him what it was his purpose to do to his brother and so put away the evil from among you
Deu  And the rest of the people hearing of it will be full of fear and never again do such evil among you
Deu  Have no pity let life be given for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot
Deu  When you go out to war against other nations and come face to face with horses and warcarriages and armies greater in number than yourselves have no fear of them for the Lord your God is with you who took you up out of the land of Egypt
Deu  And when you are on the point of attacking let the priest come forward and say to the people
Deu  Give ear O Israel today you are going forward to the fight let your heart be strong do not let uncontrolled fear overcome you because of those who are against you
Deu  For the Lord your God goes with you fighting for you to give you salvation from those who are against you
Deu  And let the overseers say to the people If there is any man who has made for himself a new house and has not gone into it let him go back to his house so that in the event of his death in the fight another may not take his house for himself
Deu  Or if any man has made a vinegarden without taking the firstfruits of it let him go back to his house so that in the event of his death in the fight another may not be the first to make use of the fruit
Deu  Or if any man is newly married and has had no sex relations with his wife let him go back to his house so that in the event of his death in the fight another man may not take her
Deu  And let the overseers go on to say to the people If there is any man whose heart is feeble with fear let him go back to his house before he makes the hearts of his countrymen feeble
Deu  Then after saying these words to the people let the overseers put captains over the army
Deu  When you come to a town before attacking it make an offer of peace
Deu  And if it gives you back an answer of peace opening its doors to you then all the people in it may be put to forced work as your servants
Deu  If however it will not make peace with you but war then let it be shut in on all sides
Deu  And when the Lord your God has given it into your hands let every male in it be put to death without mercy
Deu  But the women and the children and the cattle and everything in the town and all its wealth you may take for yourselves the wealth of your haters which the Lord your God has given you will be your food
Deu  So you are to do to all the towns far away which are not the towns of these nations
Deu  But in the towns of these peoples whose land the Lord your God is giving you for your heritage let no living thing be kept from death
Deu  Give them up to the curse the Hittite the Amorite the Canaanite the Perizzite the Hivite and the Jebusite as the Lord your God has given you orders
Deu  So that you may not take them as your example and do all the disgusting things which they do in the worship of their gods so sinning against the Lord your God
Deu  If in war a town is shut in by your armies for a long time do not let its trees be cut down and made waste for their fruit will be your food are the trees of the countryside men for you to take up arms against them
Deu  Only those trees which you are certain are not used for food may be cut down and put to destruction and you are to make walls of attack against the town till it is taken
Deu  If in the land which the Lord your God is giving you you come across the dead body of a man in the open country and you have no idea who has put him to death
Deu  Then your responsible men and your judges are to come out and give orders for the distance from the dead body to the towns round about it to be measured
Deu  And whichever town is nearest to the body the responsible men of that town are to take from the herd a young cow which has never been used for work or put under the yoke
Deu  And they are to take the cow into a valley where there is flowing water and which is not ploughed or planted and there the neck of the cow is to be broken
Deu  Then the priests the sons of Levi are to come near for they have been marked out by the Lord your God to be his servants and to give blessings in the name of the Lord and by their decision every argument and every blow is to be judged
Deu  And all the responsible men of that town which is nearest to the dead man washing their hands over the cow whose neck was broken in the valley
Deu  Will say This death is not the work of our hands and our eyes have not seen it
Deu  Have mercy O Lord on your people Israel whom you have made free and take away from your people the crime of a death without cause Then they will no longer be responsible for the mans death
Deu  So you will take away the crime of a death without cause from among you when you do what is right in the eyes of the Lord
Deu  When you go out to war against other nations and the Lord your God gives them up into your hands and you take them as prisoners
Deu  If among the prisoners you see a beautiful woman and it is your desire to make her your wife
Deu  Then take her back to your house and let her hair and her nails be cut
Deu  And let her take off the dress in which she was made prisoner and go on living in your house and weeping for her father and mother for a full month and after that you may go in to her and be her husband and she will be your wife
Deu  But if you have no delight in her you are to let her go wherever she will you may not take a price for her as if she was your property for you have made use of her for your pleasure
Deu  If a man has two wives one greatly loved and the other hated and the two of them have had children by him and if the first son is the child of the hated wife
Deu  Then when he gives his property to his sons for their heritage he is not to put the son of his loved one in the place of the first son the son of the hated wife
Deu  But he is to give his first son his birthright and twice as great a part of his property for he is the firstfruits of his strength and the right of the first son is his
Deu  If a man has a son who is hardhearted and uncontrolled who gives no attention to the voice of his father and mother and will not be ruled by them though they give him punishment
Deu  Then let his father and mother take him to the responsible men of the town to the public place
Deu  And say to them This son of ours is hardhearted and uncontrolled he will not give attention to us he gives himself up to pleasure and strong drink
Deu  Then he is to be stoned to death by all the men of the town so you are to put away the evil from among you and all Israel hearing of it will be full of fear
Deu  If a man does a crime for which the punishment is death and he is put to death by hanging him on a tree
Deu  Do not let his body be on the tree all night but put it to rest in the earth the same day for the man who undergoes hanging is cursed by God so do not make unclean the land which the Lord your God is giving you for your heritage
Deu  If you see your brothers ox or his sheep wandering do not go by without helping but take them back to your brother
Deu  If their owner is not near or if you are not certain who he is then take the beast to your house and keep it till its owner comes in search of it and then you are to give it back to him
Deu  Do the same with his ass or his robe or anything which has gone from your brothers keeping and which you have come across do not keep it to yourself
Deu  If you see your brothers ox or his ass falling down on the road do not go by without giving him help in lifting it up again
Deu  It is not right for a woman to be dressed in mans clothing or for a man to put on a womans robe whoever does such things is disgusting to the Lord your God
Deu  If by chance you see a place which a bird has made for itself in a tree or on the earth with young ones or eggs and the mother bird seated on the young ones or on the eggs do not take the mother bird with the young
Deu  See that you let the mother bird go but the young ones you may take so it will be well for you and your life will be long
Deu  If you are building a house make a railing for the roof so that the blood of any man falling from it will not come on your house
Deu  Do not have your vinegarden planted with two sorts of seed or all of it may become a loss the seed you have put in as well as the increase
Deu  Do not do your ploughing with an ox and an ass yoked together
Deu  Do not have clothing made of two sorts of thread wool and linen together
Deu  On the four edges of your robe with which your body is covered put ornaments of twisted threads
Deu  If any man takes a wife and having had connection with her has no delight in her
Deu  And says evil things about her and gives her a bad name saying I took this woman and when I had connection with her it was clear to me that she was not a virgin
Deu  Then let the girls father and mother put before the responsible men of the town in the public place signs that the girl was a virgin
Deu  And let the girls father say to the responsible men I gave my daughter to this man for his wife but he has no love for her
Deu  And now he has put shame on her saying that she is not a virgin but here is the sign that she is a virgin Then they are to put her clothing before the responsible men of the town
Deu  Then the responsible men of the town are to give the man his punishment
Deu  They will take from him a hundred shekels of silver which are to be given to the father of the girl because he has given an evil name to a virgin of Israel she will go on being his wife he may never put her away all his life
Deu  But if what he has said is true and she is seen to be not a virgin
Deu  Then they are to make the girl come to the door of her fathers house and she will be stoned to death by the men of the town because she has done evil and put shame on Israel by acting as a loose woman in her fathers house so you are to put away evil from among you
Deu  If a man is taken in the act of going in to a married woman the two of them the man as well as the woman are to be put to death so you are to put away the evil from Israel
Deu  If a young virgin has given her word to be married to a man and another man meeting her in the town has connection with her
Deu  Then you are to take the two of them to the doorway of the town and have them stoned to death the young virgin because she gave no cry for help though it was in the town and the man because he has put shame on his neighbours wife so you are to put away evil from among you
Deu  But if the man meeting such a virgin in the open country takes her by force then only the man is to be put to death
Deu  Nothing is to be done to the virgin because there is no cause of death in her it is the same as if a man made an attack on his neighbour and put him to death
Deu  For he came across her in the open country and there was no one to come to the help of the virgin in answer to her cry
Deu  If a man sees a young virgin who has not given her word to be married to anyone and he takes her by force and has connection with her and discovery is made of it
Deu  Then the man will have to give the virgins father fifty shekels of silver and make her his wife because he has put shame on her he may never put her away all his life
Deu  A man may not take his fathers wife or have sex relations with a woman who is his fathers
Deu  No man whose private parts have been wounded or cut off may come into the meeting of the Lords people
Deu  One whose father and mother are not married may not come into the meeting of the Lords people or any of his family to the tenth generation
Deu  No Ammonite or Moabite or any of their people to the tenth generation may come into the meeting of the Lords people
Deu  Because they gave you no bread or water on your way when you came out of Egypt and they got Balaam the son of Peor from Pethor in Aramnaharaim to put curses on you
Deu  But the Lord your God would not give ear to Balaam but let the curse be changed into a blessing to you because of his love for you
Deu  Do nothing for their peace or wellbeing for ever
Deu  But have no hate for an Edomite because he is your brother or for an Egyptian for you were living in his land
Deu  Their children in the third generation may come into the meeting of the Lords people
Deu  When you go out to war and put your tents in position keep from every evil thing
Deu  If any man among you becomes unclean through anything which has taken place in the night he is to go out from the tentcircle and keep outside it
Deu  But when evening comes near let him take a bath and after sundown he may come back to the tents
Deu  Let there be a place outside the tentcircle to which you may go
Deu  And have among your arms a spade and when you have been to that place let that which comes from you be covered up with earth
Deu  For the Lord your God is walking among your tents to keep you safe and to give up into your hands those who are fighting against you then let your tents be holy so that he may see no unclean thing among you and be turned away from you
Deu  Do not give back to his master a servant who has gone in flight from his master and come to you
Deu  Let him go on living among you in whatever place is most pleasing to him do not be hard on him
Deu  No daughter of Israel is to let herself be used as a loose woman for a strange god and no son of Israel is to give himself to a man
Deu  Do not take into the house of the Lord your God as an offering for an oath the price of a loose woman or the money given to one used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods for these two things are disgusting to the Lord your God
Deu  Do not take interest from an Israelite on anything money or food or any other goods which you let him have
Deu  From men of other nations you may take interest but not from an Israelite so that the blessing of the Lord your God may be on everything to which you put your hand in the land which you are about to take as your heritage
Deu  When you take an oath to the Lord do not be slow to give effect to it for without doubt the Lord your God will make you responsible and will put it to your account as sin
Deu  But if you take no oath there will be no sin
Deu  Whatever your lips have said see that you do it for you gave your word freely to the Lord your God
Deu  When you go into your neighbours vinegarden you may take of his grapes at your pleasure but you may not take them away in your vessel
Deu  When you go into your neighbours field you may take the heads of grain with your hand but you may not put your blade to his grain
Deu  If a man takes a wife and after they are married she is unpleasing to him because of some bad quality in her let him give her a statement in writing and send her away from his house
Deu  And when she has gone away from him she may become another mans wife
Deu  And if the second husband has no love for her and giving her a statement in writing sends her away or if death comes to the second husband to whom she was married
Deu  Her first husband who had sent her away may not take her back after she has been wife to another for that is disgusting to the Lord and you are not to be a cause of sin in the land which the Lord your God is giving you for your heritage
Deu  A newly married man will not have to go out with the army or undertake any business but may be free for one year living in his house for the comfort of his wife
Deu  No one is to take on account of a debt the stones with which grain is crushed for in doing so he takes a mans living
Deu  If a man takes by force one of his countrymen the children of Israel using him as his property or getting a price for him that thief is to be put to death so you are to put away evil from among you
Deu  In connection with the lepers disease take care to keep and do every detail of the teaching of the priests the Levites as I gave them orders so you are to do
Deu  Keep in mind what the Lord your God did to Miriam on the way when you came out of Egypt
Deu  If you let your brother have the use of anything which is yours do not go into his house and take anything of his as a sign of his debt
Deu  But keep outside till he comes out and gives it to you
Deu  If he is a poor man do not keep his property all night
Deu  But be certain to give it back to him when the sun goes down so that he may have his clothing for sleeping in and will give you his blessing and this will be put to your account as righteousness before the Lord your God
Deu  Do not be hard on a servant who is poor and in need if he is one of your countrymen or a man from another nation living with you in your land
Deu  Give him his payment day by day not keeping it back over night for he is poor and his living is dependent on it and if his cry against you comes to the ears of the Lord it will be judged as sin in you
Deu  Fathers are not to be put to death for their children or children for their fathers every man is to be put to death for the sin which he himself has done
Deu  Be upright in judging the cause of the man from a strange country and of him who has no father do not take a widows clothing on account of a debt
Deu  But keep in mind that you were a servant in the land of Egypt and the Lord your God made you free for this is why I give you orders to do this
Deu  When you get in the grain from your field if some of the grain has been dropped by chance in the field do not go back and get it but let it be for the man from a strange land the child without a father and the widow so that the blessing of the Lord your God may be on all the work of your hands
Deu  When you are shaking the fruit from your olivetrees do not go over the branches a second time let some be for the man from a strange land the child without a father and the widow
Deu  When you are pulling the grapes from your vines do not take up those which have been dropped let them be for the man from a strange land the child without a father and the widow
Deu  Keep in mind that you were a servant in the land of Egypt for this is why I give you orders to do this
Deu  If there is an argument between men and they go to law with one another let the judges give their decision for the upright and against the wrongdoer
Deu  And if the wrongdoer is to undergo punishment by whipping the judge will give orders for him to go down on his face and be whipped before him the number of the blows being in relation to his crime
Deu  He may be given forty blows not more for if more are given your brother may be shamed before you
Deu  Do not keep the ox from taking the grain when he is crushing it
Deu  If brothers are living together and one of them at his death has no son the wife of the dead man is not to be married outside the family to another man let her husbands brother go in to her and make her his wife doing as it is right for a brotherinlaw to do
Deu  Then the first male child she has will take the rights of the brother who is dead so that his name may not come to an end in Israel
Deu  But if the man says he will not take his brothers wife then let the wife go to the responsible men of the town and say My husbands brother will not keep his brothers name living in Israel he will not do what it is right for a husbands brother to do
Deu  Then the responsible men of the town will send for the man and have talk with him and if he still says I will not take her
Deu  Then his brothers wife is to come to him before the responsible men of the town and take his shoe off his foot and put shame on him and say So let it be done to the man who will not take care of his brothers name
Deu  And his family will be named in Israel The house of him whose shoe has been taken off
Deu  If two men are fighting and the wife of one of them coming to the help of her husband takes the other by the private parts
Deu  Her hand is to be cut off have no pity on her
Deu  Do not have in your bag different weights a great and a small
Deu  Or in your house different measures a great and a small
Deu  But have a true weight and a true measure so that your life may be long in the land which the Lord your God is giving you
Deu  For all who do such things and all whose ways are not upright are disgusting to the Lord your God
Deu  Keep in mind what Amalek did to you on your way from Egypt
Deu  How meeting you on the way he made an attack on you when you were tired and without strength cutting off all the feeble ones at the end of your line and the fear of God was not in him
Deu  So when the Lord your God has given you rest from all who are against you on every side in the land which the Lord your God is giving you for your heritage see to it that the memory of Amalek is cut off from the earth keep this in mind
Deu  Now when you have come into the land which the Lord is giving you for your heritage and you have made it yours and are living in it
Deu  You are to take a part of the firstfruits of the earth which you get from the land which the Lord your God is giving you and put it in a basket and go to the place marked out by the Lord your God as the restingplace of his name
Deu  And you are to come to him who is priest at that time and say to him I give witness today before the Lord your God that I have come into the land which the Lord made an oath to our fathers to give us
Deu  Then the priest will take the basket from your hand and put it down in front of the altar of the Lord your God
Deu  And these are the words which you will say before the Lord your God My father was a wandering Aramaean and he went down with a small number of people into Egypt there he became a great and strong nation
Deu  And the Egyptians were cruel to us crushing us under a hard yoke
Deu  And our cry went up to the Lord the God of our fathers and the Lords ear was open to the voice of our cry and his eyes took note of our grief and the crushing weight of our work
Deu  And the Lord took us out of Egypt with a strong hand and a stretchedout arm with works of power and signs and wonders
Deu  And he has been our guide to this place and has given us this land a land flowing with milk and honey
Deu  So now I have come here with the first of the fruits of the earth which you O Lord have given me Then you will put it down before the Lord your God and give him worship
Deu  And you will have joy in every good thing which the Lord your God has given to you and to your family and the Levite and the man from a strange land who is with you will take part in your joy
Deu  When you have taken out a tenth from the tenth of all your produce in the third year which is the year when this has to be done give it to the Levite and the man from a strange land and the child without a father and the widow so that they may have food in your towns and be full
Deu  And say before the Lord your God I have taken all the holy things out of my house and have given them to the Levite and the man from a strange land and him who has no father and the widow as you have given me orders I have kept in mind all your orders in nothing have I gone against them
Deu  No part of these things has been used for food in a time of weeping or put away when I was unclean or given for the dead I have given ear to the voice of the Lord my God and have done all you have given me orders to do
Deu  So looking down from your holy place in heaven send your blessing on your people Israel and on the land which you have given us as you said in your oath to our fathers a land flowing with milk and honey
Deu  Today the Lord your God gives you orders to keep all these laws and decisions so then keep and do them with all your heart and all your soul
Deu  Today you have given witness that the Lord is your God and that you will go in his ways and keep his laws and his orders and his decisions and give ear to his voice
Deu  And the Lord has made it clear this day that you are a special people to him as he gave you his word and that you are to keep all his orders
Deu  And that he will make you high over all the nations he has made in praise in name and in honour and that you are to be a holy people to the Lord your God as he has said
Deu  Then Moses and the responsible men of Israel gave the people these orders Keep all the orders which I have given you this day
Deu  And on the day when you go over Jordan into the land which the Lord your God is giving you put up great stones coating them with buildingpaste
Deu  And writing on them all the words of this law after you have gone over so that you may take the heritage which the Lord your God is giving you a land flowing with milk and honey as the Lord the God of your fathers has said
Deu  And when you have gone over Jordan you are to put up these stones as I have said to you today in Mount Ebal and have them coated with buildingpaste
Deu  There you are to make an altar to the Lord your God of stones on which no iron instrument has been used
Deu  You are to make the altar of the Lord your God of uncut stones offering on it burned offerings to the Lord your God
Deu  And you are to make your peaceofferings feasting there with joy before the Lord your God
Deu  And put on the stones all the words of this law writing them very clearly
Deu  Then Moses and the priests the Levites said to all Israel Be quiet and give ear O Israel today you have become the people of the Lord your God
Deu  For this cause you are to give ear to the voice of the Lord your God and do his orders and his laws which I give you this day
Deu  That same day Moses said to the people
Deu  These are to take their places on Mount Gerizim for blessing the people when you have gone over Jordan Simeon and Levi and Judah and Issachar and Joseph and Benjamin
Deu  And these are to be on Mount Ebal for the curse Reuben Gad and Asher and Zebulun Dan and Naphtali
Deu  Then the Levites are to say in a loud voice to all the men of Israel
Deu  Cursed is the man who makes any image of wood or stone or metal disgusting to the Lord the work of mans hands and puts it up in secret And let all the people say So be it
Deu  Cursed is he who does not give honour to his father or mother And let all the people say So be it
Deu  Cursed is he who takes his neighbours landmark from its place And let all the people say So be it
Deu  Cursed is he by whom the blind are turned out of the way And let all the people say So be it
Deu  Cursed is he who gives a wrong decision in the cause of a man from a strange land or of one without a father or of a widow And let all the people say So be it
Deu  Cursed is he who has sex relations with his fathers wife for he has put shame on his father And let all the people say So be it
Deu  Cursed is he who has sex relations with any sort of beast And let all the people say So be it
Deu  Cursed is he who has sex relations with his sister the daughter of his father or of his mother And let all the people say So be it
Deu  Cursed is he who has sex relations with his motherinlaw And let all the people say So be it
Deu  Cursed is he who takes his neighbours life secretly And let all the people say So be it
Deu  Cursed is he who for a reward puts to death one who has done no wrong And let all the people say So be it
Deu  Cursed is he who does not take this law to heart to do it And let all the people say So be it
Deu  Now if you give ear to the voice of the Lord your God and keep with care all these orders which I have given you today then the Lord your God will put you high over all the nations of the earth
Deu  And all these blessings will come on you and overtake you if your ears are open to the voice of the Lord your God
Deu  A blessing will be on you in the town and a blessing in the field
Deu  A blessing will be on the fruit of your body and on the fruit of your land on the fruit of your cattle the increase of your herd and the young of your flock
Deu  A blessing will be on your basket and on your breadbasin
Deu  A blessing will be on your coming in and on your going out
Deu  By the power of the Lord those who take arms against you will be overcome before you they will come out against you one way and will go in flight from you seven ways
Deu  The Lord will send his blessing on your storehouses and on everything to which you put your hand his blessing will be on you in the land which the Lord your God is giving you
Deu  The Lord will keep you as a people holy to himself as he has said to you in his oath if you keep the orders of the Lord your God and go on walking in his ways
Deu  And all the peoples of the earth will see that the name of the Lord is on you and they will go in fear of you
Deu  And the Lord will make you fertile in every good thing in the fruit of your body and the fruit of your cattle and the fruit of your fields in the land which the Lord by his oath to your fathers said he would give you
Deu  Opening his storehouse in heaven the Lord will send rain on your land at the right time blessing all the work of your hands other nations will make use of your wealth and you will have no need of theirs
Deu  The Lord will make you the head and not the tail and you will ever have the highest place if you give ear to the orders of the Lord your God which I give you today to keep and to do them
Deu  Not turning away from any of the orders which I give you today to the right hand or to the left or going after any other gods to give them worship
Deu  But if you do not give ear to the voice of the Lord your God and take care to do all his orders and his laws which I give you today then all these curses will come on you and overtake you
Deu  You will be cursed in the town and cursed in the field
Deu  A curse will be on your basket and on your breadbasin
Deu  A curse will be on the fruit of your body and on the fruit of your land on the increase of your cattle and the young of your flock
Deu  You will be cursed when you come in and cursed when you go out
Deu  The Lord will send on you cursing and trouble and punishment in everything to which you put your hand till sudden destruction overtakes you because of your evil ways in which you have been false to me
Deu  The Lord will send disease after disease on you till you have been cut off by death from the land to which you are going
Deu  The Lord will send wasting disease and burning pain and flaming heat against you keeping back the rain till your land is waste and dead so will it be till your destruction is complete
Deu  And the heaven over your heads will be brass and the earth under you hard as iron
Deu  The Lord will make the rain of your land powder and dust sending it down on you from heaven till your destruction is complete
Deu  The Lord will let you be overcome by your haters you will go out against them one way and you will go in flight before them seven ways you will be the cause of fear among all the kingdoms of the earth
Deu  Your bodies will be meat for all the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth there will be no one to send them away
Deu  The Lord will send on you the disease of Egypt and other sorts of skin diseases which nothing will make well
Deu  He will make your minds diseased and your eyes blind and your hearts wasted with fear
Deu  You will go feeling your way when the sun is high like a blind man for whom all is dark and nothing will go well for you you will be crushed and made poor for ever and you will have no saviour
Deu  You will take a wife but another man will have the use of her the house which your hands have made will never be your restingplace you will make a vinegarden and never take the fruit of it
Deu  Your ox will be put to death before your eyes but its flesh will not be your food your ass will be violently taken away before your face and will not be given back to you your sheep will be given to your haters and there will be no saviour for you
Deu  Your sons and your daughters will be given to another people and your eyes will be wasted away with looking and weeping for them all the day and you will have no power to do anything
Deu  The fruit of your land and all the work of your hands will be food for a nation which is strange to you and to your fathers you will only be crushed down and kept under for ever
Deu  So that the things which your eyes have to see will send you out of your minds
Deu  The Lord will send a skin disease attacking your knees and your legs bursting out from your feet to the top of your head so that nothing will make you well
Deu  And you and the king whom you have put over you will the Lord take away to a nation strange to you and to your fathers there you will be servants to other gods of wood and stone
Deu  And you will become a wonder and a name of shame among all the nations where the Lord will take you
Deu  You will take much seed out into the field and get little in for the locust will get it
Deu  You will put in vines and take care of them but you will get no wine or grapes from them for they will be food for worms
Deu  Your land will be full of olivetrees but there will be no oil for the comfort of your body for your olivetree will give no fruit
Deu  You will have sons and daughters but they will not be yours for they will go away prisoners into a strange land
Deu  All your trees and the fruit of your land will be the locusts
Deu  The man from a strange land who is living among you will be lifted up higher and higher over you while you go down lower and lower
Deu  He will let you have his wealth at interest and will have no need of yours he will be the head and you the tail
Deu  And all these curses will come after you and overtake you till your destruction is complete because you did not give ear to the voice of the Lord your God or keep his laws and his orders which he gave you
Deu  These things will come on you and on your seed to be a sign and a wonder for ever
Deu  Because you did not give honour to the Lord your God worshipping him gladly with joy in your hearts on account of all your wealth of good things
Deu  For this cause you will become servants to those whom the Lord your God will send against you without food and drink and clothing and in need of all things and he will put a yoke of iron on your neck till he has put an end to you
Deu  The Lord will send a nation against you from the farthest ends of the earth coming with the flight of an eagle a nation whose language is strange to you
Deu  A hardfaced nation who will have no respect for the old or mercy for the young
Deu  He will take the fruit of your cattle and of your land till death puts an end to you he will let you have nothing of your grain or wine or oil or any of the increase of your cattle or the young of your flock till he has made your destruction complete
Deu  Your towns will be shut in by his armies till your high walls in which you put your faith have come down his armies will be round your towns through all your land which the Lord your God has given you
Deu  And your food will be the fruit of your body the flesh of the sons and daughters which the Lord your God has given you because of your bitter need and the cruel grip of your haters
Deu  That man among you who is soft and used to comfort will be hard and cruel to his brother and to his dear wife and to of those his children who are still living
Deu  And will not give to any of them the flesh of his children which will be his food because he has no other in the cruel grip of your haters on all your towns
Deu  The most soft and delicate of your women who would not so much as put her foot on the earth so delicate is she will be hardhearted to her husband and to her son and to her daughter
Deu  And to her baby newly come to birth and to the children of her body for having no other food she will make a meal of them secretly because of her bitter need and the cruel grip of your haters on all your towns
Deu  If you will not take care to do all the words of this law recorded in this book honouring that name of glory and of fear THE LORD YOUR GOD
Deu  Then the Lord your God will make your punishment and the punishment of your seed a thing to be wondered at great punishments and cruel diseases stretching on through long years
Deu  He will send on you again all the diseases of Egypt which were a cause of fear to you and they will take you in their grip
Deu  And all the diseases and the pains not recorded in the book of this law will the Lord send on you till your destruction is complete
Deu  And you will become a very small band though your numbers were like the stars of heaven because you did not give ear to the voice of the Lord your God
Deu  And as the Lord took delight in doing you good and increasing you so the Lord will take pleasure in cutting you off and causing your destruction and you will be uprooted from the land which you are about to take as your heritage
Deu  And the Lord will send you wandering among all peoples from one end of the earth to the other there you will be servants to other gods of wood and stone gods of which you and your fathers had no knowledge
Deu  And even among these nations there will be no peace for you and no rest for your feet but the Lord will give you there a shaking heart and wasting eyes and weariness of soul
Deu  Your very life will be hanging in doubt before you and day and night will be dark with fears and nothing in life will be certain
Deu  In the morning you will say If only it was evening And at evening you will say If only morning would come Because of the fear in your hearts and the things which your eyes will see
Deu  And the Lord will take you back to Egypt again in ships by the way of which I said to you You will never see it again there you will be offering yourselves as menservants and womenservants to your haters for a price and no man will take you
Deu  These are the words of the agreement which Moses was ordered by the Lord to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab in addition to the agreement which he made with them in Horeb
Deu  And Moses said in the hearing of all Israel You have seen all the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh and to all his servants and all his land
Deu  The great tests which your eyes saw and the signs and wonders
Deu  But even to this day the Lord has not given you a mind open to knowledge or seeing eyes or hearing ears
Deu  For forty years I have been your guide through the waste land your clothing has not become old on your backs or your shoes on your feet
Deu  You have had no bread or wine or strong drink so that you might see that I am the Lord your God
Deu  When you came to this place Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out to make war against us and we overcame them
Deu  And we took their land and gave it to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the halftribe of Manasseh for their heritage
Deu  So keep the words of this agreement and do them so that it may be well for you in everything you do
Deu  You have come here today all of you before the Lord your God the heads of your tribes the overseers and those who are in authority over you with all the men of Israel
Deu  And your little ones your wives and the men of other lands who are with you in your tents down to the woodcutter and the servant who gets water for you
Deu  With the purpose of taking part in the agreement of the Lord your God and his oath which he makes with you today
Deu  And so that he may make you his people today and be your God as he has said to you and as he made an oath to your fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob
Deu  And not with you only do I make this agreement and this oath
Deu  But with everyone who is here with us today before the Lord our God as well as with those who are not here
Deu  For you have in mind how we were living in the land of Egypt and how we came through all the nations which were on your way
Deu  And you have seen their disgusting doings and the images of wood and stone and silver and gold which were among them
Deu  So that there may not be among you any man or woman or family or tribe whose heart is turned away from the Lord our God today to go after other gods and give them worship or any root among you whose fruit is poison and bitter sorrow
Deu  If such a man hearing the words of this oath takes comfort in the thought that he will have peace even if he goes on in the pride of his heart taking whatever chance may give him
Deu  The Lord will have no mercy on him but the wrath of the Lord will be burning against that man and all the curses recorded in this book will be waiting for him and the Lord will take away his name completely from the earth
Deu  He will be marked out by the Lord from all the tribes of Israel for an evil fate in keeping with all the curses of the agreement recorded in this book of the law
Deu  And future generations your children coming after you and travellers from far countries will say when they see the punishments of that land and the diseases which the Lord has sent on it
Deu  And that all the land is a salt and smoking waste not planted or giving fruit or clothed with grass but wasted like Sodom and Gomorrah Admah and Zeboiim on which the Lord sent destruction in the heat of his wrath
Deu  Truly all the nations will say Why has the Lord done so to this land what is the reason for this great and burning wrath
Deu  Then men will say Because they gave up the agreement of the Lord the God of their fathers which he made with them when he took them out of the land of Egypt
Deu  And they went after other gods and gave them worship gods who were strange to them and whom he had not given them
Deu  And so the wrath of the Lord was moved against this land to send on it all the curse recorded in this book
Deu  Rooting them out of their land in the heat of his wrath and passion and driving them out into another land as at this day
Deu  The secret things are the Lord our Gods but the things which have been made clear are ours and our childrens for ever so that we may do all the words of this law
Deu  Now when all these things have come on you the blessing and the curse which I have put before you if the thought of them comes back to your minds when you are living among the nations where the Lord your God has sent you
Deu  And your hearts are turned again to the Lord your God and you give ear to his word which I give you today you and your children with all your heart and with all your soul
Deu  Then the Lord will have pity on you changing your fate and taking you back again from among all the nations where you have been forced to go
Deu  Even if those who have been forced out are living in the farthest part of heaven the Lord your God will go in search of you and take you back
Deu  Placing you again in the land of your fathers as your heritage and he will do you good increasing you till you are more in number than your fathers were
Deu  And the Lord your God will give to you and to your seed a circumcision of the heart so that loving him with all your heart and all your soul you may have life
Deu  And the Lord your God will put all these curses on those who are against you and on your haters who put a cruel yoke on you
Deu  And you will again give ear to the voice of the Lord and do all his orders which I have given you today
Deu  And the Lord your God will make you fertile in all good things blessing the work of your hands and the fruit of your body and the fruit of your cattle and the fruit of your land for the Lord will have joy in you as he had in your fathers
Deu  If you give ear to the voice of the Lord your God keeping his orders and his laws which are recorded in this book of the law and turning to the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul
Deu  For these orders which I have given you today are not strange and secret and are not far away
Deu  They are not in heaven for you to say Who will go up to heaven for us and give us knowledge of them so that we may do them
Deu  And they are not across the sea for you to say Who will go over the sea for us and give us news of them so that we may do them
Deu  But the word is very near you in your mouth and in your heart so that you may do it
Deu  See I have put before you today life and good and death and evil
Deu  In giving you orders today to have love for the Lord your God to go in his ways and keep his laws and his orders and his decisions so that you may have life and be increased and that the blessing of the Lord your God may be with you in the land where you are going the land of your heritage
Deu  But if your heart is turned away and your ear is shut and you go after those who would make you servants and worshippers of other gods
Deu  I give witness against you this day that destruction will certainly be your fate and your days will be cut short in the land where you are going the land of your heritage on the other side of Jordan
Deu  Let heaven and earth be my witnesses against you this day that I have put before you life and death a blessing and a curse so take life for yourselves and for your seed
Deu  In loving the Lord your God hearing his voice and being true to him for he is your life and by him will your days be long so that you may go on living in the land which the Lord gave by an oath to your fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob
Deu  So Moses said all these things to Israel
Deu  Then he said to them I am now a hundred and twenty years old I am no longer able to go out and come in and the Lord has said to me You are not to go over Jordan
Deu  The Lord your God he will go over before you he will send destruction on all those nations and you will take their land as your heritage and Joshua will go over at your head as the Lord has said
Deu  The Lord will do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og the kings of the Amorites and to their land whom he put to destruction
Deu  The Lord will give them up into your hands and you are to do to them as I have given you orders
Deu  Be strong and take heart and have no fear of them for it is the Lord your God who is going with you he will not take away his help from you
Deu  Then Moses sent for Joshua and before the eyes of all Israel said to him Be strong and take heart for you are to go with this people into the land which the Lord by his oath to their fathers has given them by your help they will take it for their heritage
Deu  It is the Lord who goes before you he will be with you he will not take away his help from you or give you up so have no fear
Deu  Then Moses put all this law in writing and gave it to the priests the sons of Levi who take up the ark of the Lords agreement and to all the responsible men of Israel
Deu  And Moses said to them At the end of every seven years at the time fixed for the ending of debts at the feast of tents
Deu  When all Israel has come before the Lord your God in the place named by him let a reading be given of this law in the hearing of all Israel
Deu  Make all the people come together men and women and children and anyone from another country who is with you so that hearing they may become wise in the fear of the Lord your God and take care to do all the words of this law
Deu  And so that your children to whom it is new may give ear and be trained in the fear of the Lord your God while you are living in the land which you are going over Jordan to take for your heritage
Deu  At that time the Lord said to Moses The day of your death is near send for Joshua and come to the Tent of meeting so that I may give him his orders So Moses and Joshua went to the Tent of meeting
Deu  And the Lord was seen in the Tent in a pillar of cloud resting by the door of the Tent
Deu  And the Lord said to Moses Now you are going to rest with your fathers and this people will be false to me uniting themselves to the strange gods of the land where they are going they will be turned away from me and will not keep the agreement I have made with them
Deu  In that day my wrath will be moved against them and I will be turned away from them veiling my face from them and destruction will overtake them and unnumbered evils and troubles will come on them so that in that day they will say Have not these evils come on us because our God is not with us
Deu  Truly my face will be turned away from them in that day because of all the evil they have done in going after other gods
Deu  Make then this song for yourselves teaching it to the children of Israel put it in their mouths so that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel
Deu  For when I have taken them into the land named in my oath to their fathers a land flowing with milk and honey and they have made themselves full of food and are fat then they will be turned to other gods and will give them worship no longer honouring me or keeping my agreement
Deu  Then when evils and troubles without number have overtaken them this song will be a witness to them for the words of it will be clear in the memories of their children for I see the thoughts which are moving in their hearts even now before I have taken them into the land of my oath
Deu  So that same day Moses made this song teaching it to the children of Israel
Deu  Then he gave orders to Joshua the son of Nun saying to him Be strong and take heart for you are to go at the head of the children of Israel into the land which I made an oath to give them and I will be with you
Deu  Now after writing all the words of this law in a book till the record of them was complete
Deu  Moses said to the Levites who were responsible for taking up the ark of the Lords agreement
Deu  Take this book of the law and put it by the ark of the Lords agreement so that it may be a witness against you
Deu  For I have knowledge of your hard and uncontrolled hearts even now while I am still living you will not be ruled by the Lord how much less after my death
Deu  Get together before me all those who are in authority in your tribes and your overseers so that I may say these things in their hearing and make heaven and earth my witnesses against them
Deu  For I am certain that after my death you will give yourselves up to sin wandering from the way which I have given you and evil will overtake you in the end because you will do evil in the eyes of the Lord moving him to wrath by the work of your hands
Deu  Then in the hearing of all the meeting of Israel Moses said the words of this song to the end
Deu  Give ear O heavens to my voice let the earth take note of the words of my mouth
Deu  My teaching is dropping like rain coming down like dew on the fields like rain on the young grass and showers on the garden plants
Deu  For I will give honour to the name of the Lord let our God be named great
Deu  He is the Rock complete is his work for all his ways are righteousness a God without evil who keeps faith true and upright is he
Deu  They have become false they are not his children the mark of sin is on them they are an evil and hardhearted generation
Deu  Is this your answer to the Lord O foolish people and unwise Is he not your father who has given you life He has made you and given you your place
Deu  Keep in mind the days of the past give thought to the years of generations gone by go to your father and he will make it clear to you to the old men and they will give you the story
Deu  When the Most High gave the nations their heritage separating into groups the children of men he had the limits of the peoples marked out keeping in mind the number of the children of Israel
Deu  For the Lords wealth is his people Jacob is the land of his heritage
Deu  He came to him in the waste land in the unpeopled waste of sand putting his arms round him and caring for him he kept him as the light of his eye
Deu  As an eagle teaching her young to make their flight with her wings outstretched over them takes them up on her strong feathers
Deu  So the Lord only was his guide no other god was with him
Deu  He put him on the high places of the earth his food was the increase of the field honey he gave him out of the rock and oil out of the hard rock
Deu  Butter from his cows and milk from his sheep with fat of lambs and sheep of Bashan and goats and the heart of the grain and for your drink wine from the blood of the grape
Deu  But Jeshurun became fat and would not be controlled you have become fat you are thick and full of food then he was untrue to the God who made him giving no honour to the Rock of his salvation
Deu  The honour which was his they gave to strange gods by their disgusting ways he was moved to wrath
Deu  They made offerings to evil spirits which were not God to gods who were strange to them which had newly come up not feared by your fathers
Deu  You have no thought for the Rock your father you have no memory of the God who gave you birth
Deu  And the Lord saw with disgust the evildoing of his sons and daughters
Deu  And he said My face will be veiled from them I will see what their end will be for they are an uncontrolled generation children in whom is no faith
Deu  They have given my honour to that which is not God moving me to wrath with their false worship I will give their honour to those who are not a people moving them to wrath by a foolish nation
Deu  For my wrath is a flaming fire burning to the deep parts of the underworld burning up the earth with her increase and firing the deep roots of the mountains
Deu  I will send a rain of troubles on them my arrows will be showered on them
Deu  They will be wasted from need of food and overcome by burning heat and bitter destruction and the teeth of beasts I will send on them with the poison of the worms of the dust
Deu  Outside they will be cut off by the sword and in the inner rooms by fear death will take the young man and the virgin the baby at the breast and the greyhaired man
Deu  I said I would send them wandering far away I would make all memory of them go from the minds of men
Deu  But for the fear that their haters uplifted in their pride might say Our hand is strong the Lord has not done all this
Deu  For they are a nation without wisdom there is no sense in them
Deu  If only they were wise if only this was clear to them and they would give thought to their future
Deu  How would it be possible for one to overcome a thousand and two to send ten thousand in flight if their rock had not let them go if the Lord had not given them up
Deu  For their rock is not like our Rock even our haters themselves being judges
Deu  For their vine is the vine of Sodom from the fields of Gomorrah their grapes are the grapes of evil and the berries are bitter
Deu  Their wine is the poison of dragons the cruel poison of snakes
Deu  Is not this among my secrets kept safe in my storehouse
Deu  Punishment is mine and reward at the time of the slipping of their feet for the day of their downfall is near sudden will be their fate
Deu  For the Lord will be judge of his people he will have pity for his servants when he sees that their power is gone there is no one shut up or free
Deu  And he will say Where are their gods the rock in which they put their faith
Deu  Who took the fat of their offerings and the wine of their drink offering Let them now come to your help let them be your salvation
Deu  See now I myself am he there is no other god but me giver of death and life wounding and making well and no one has power to make you free from my hand
Deu  For lifting up my hand to heaven I say By my unending life
Deu  If I make sharp my shining sword and my hand is outstretched for judging I will give punishment to those who are against me and their right reward to my haters
Deu  I will make my arrows red with blood my sword will be feasting on flesh with the blood of the dead and the prisoners of the longhaired heads of my haters
Deu  Be glad O you his people over the nations for he will take payment for the blood of his servants and will give punishment to his haters and take away the sin of his land for his people
Deu  So Moses said all the words of this song in the hearing of the people he and Hoshea the son of Nun
Deu  And after saying all this to the people
Deu  Moses said to them Let the words which I have said to you today go deep into your hearts and give orders to your children to do every word of this law
Deu  And this is no small thing for you but it is your life and through this you may make your days long in the land which you are going over Jordan to take for your heritage
Deu  That same day the Lord said to Moses
Deu  Go up into this mountain of Abarim to Mount Nebo in the land of Moab opposite Jericho there you may see the land of Canaan which I am giving to the children of Israel for their heritage
Deu  And let death come to you on the mountain where you are going and be put to rest with your people as death came to Aaron your brother on Mount Hor where he was put to rest with his people
Deu  Because of your sin against me before the children of Israel at the waters of Meribath Kadesh in the waste land of Zin because you did not keep my name holy among the children of Israel
Deu  So you will see the land before you but you will not go into the land which I am giving to the children of Israel
Deu  Now this is the blessing which Moses the man of God gave to the children of Israel before his death
Deu  He said The Lord came from Sinai dawning on them from Seir shining out from Mount Paran coming from Meribath Kadesh from his right hand went flames of fire his wrath made waste the peoples
Deu  All his holy ones are at his hand they go at his feet they are lifted up on his wings
Deu  Moses gave us a law a heritage for the people of Jacob
Deu  And there was a king in Jeshurun when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel came together
Deu  Let life not death be Reubens let not the number of his men be small
Deu  And this is the blessing of Judah he said Give ear O Lord to the voice of Judah and make him one with his people let your hands take up his cause and be his help against his attackers
Deu  And of Levi he said Give your Thummim to Levi and let the Urim be with your loved one whom you put to the test at Massah with whom you were angry at the waters of Meribah
Deu  Who said of his father Who is he and of his mother I have not seen her he kept himself separate from his brothers and had no knowledge of his children for they have given ear to your word and kept your agreement
Deu  They will be the teachers of your decisions to Jacob and of your law to Israel the burning of perfumes before you will be their right and the ordering of burned offerings on your altar
Deu  Let your blessing O Lord be on his substance may the work of his hands be pleasing to you may those who take up arms against him and all who have hate for him be wounded through the heart never to be lifted up again
Deu  And of Benjamin he said Benjamin is the loved one of the Lord he will be kept safe at all times he will be covered by the Most High resting between his arms
Deu  And of Joseph he said Let the blessing of the Lord be on his land for the good things of heaven on high and the deep waters flowing under the earth
Deu  And the good things of the fruits of the sun and the good things of the growth of the moons
Deu  And the chief things of the oldest mountains and the good things of the eternal hills
Deu  The good things of the earth and all its wealth the good pleasure of him who was seen in the burning tree may they come on the head of Joseph on the head of him who was prince among his brothers
Deu  He is a young ox glory is his his horns are the horns of the mountain ox with which all peoples will be wounded even to the ends of the earth they are the ten thousands of Ephraim and the thousands of Manasseh
Deu  And of Zebulun he said Be glad Zebulun in your going out and Issachar in your tents
Deu  They will send out the word for the people to come to the mountain taking there the offerings of righteousness for the store of the seas will be theirs and the secret wealth of the sand
Deu  Of Gad he said A blessing be on him who makes wide the limits of Gad he takes his rest like a shelion taking for himself the arm and the crown of the head
Deu  He kept for himself the first part for his was the rulers right he put in force the righteousness of the Lord and his decisions for Israel
Deu  And of Dan he said Dan is a young lion springing out from Bashan
Deu  And of Naphtali he said O Naphtali made glad with grace and full of the blessing of the Lord the sea and its fishes will be his
Deu  And of Asher he said Let Asher have the blessing of children may he be pleasing to his brothers and let his foot be wet with oil
Deu  Your shoes will be iron and brass and as your days so may your work be
Deu  No other is like the God of Jeshurun coming on the heavens to your help and letting his glory be seen in the skies
Deu  The God of your fathers is your safe restingplace and under you are his eternal arms driving out the forces of your haters from before you he said Let destruction overtake them
Deu  And Israel is living in peace the fountain of Jacob by himself in a land of grain and wine with dew dropping from the heavens
Deu  Happy are you O Israel who is like you a people whose saviour is the Lord whose help is your cover whose sword is your strength All those who are against you will put themselves under your rule and your feet will be planted on their high places
Deu  And Moses went up from the tablelands of Moab to Mount Nebo to the top of Pisgah which is facing Jericho And the Lord let him see all the land the land of Gilead as far as Dan
Deu  And all Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh and all the land of Judah as far as the Great Sea of the west
Deu  And the South and the circle of the valley of Jericho the town of palmtrees as far as Zoar
Deu  And the Lord said to him This is the land about which I made an oath to Abraham Isaac and Jacob saying I will give it to your seed now I have let you see it with your eyes but you will not go in there
Deu  So death came to Moses the servant of the Lord there in the land of Moab as the Lord had said
Deu  And the Lord put him to rest in the valley in the land of Moab opposite Bethpeor but no man has knowledge of his restingplace to this day
Deu  And Moses at his death was a hundred and twenty years old his eye had not become clouded or his natural force become feeble
Deu  For thirty days the children of Israel were weeping for Moses in the tablelands of Moab till the days of weeping and sorrow for Moses were ended
Deu  And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom for Moses had put his hands on him and the children of Israel gave ear to him and did as the Lord had given orders to Moses
Deu  There has never been another prophet in Israel like Moses whom the Lord had knowledge of face to face
Deu  In all the signs and wonders which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh and to all his servants and all his land
Deu  And in all the acts of power and fear which Moses did before the eyes of all Israel
Jos  Now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord the word of the Lord came to Joshua the son of Nun Moses helper saying
Jos  Moses my servant is dead so now get up Go over Jordan you and all this people into the land which I am giving to them to the children of Israel
Jos  Every place on which you put your foot I have given to you as I said to Moses
Jos  From the waste land and this mountain Lebanon as far as the great river the river Euphrates and all the land of the Hittites to the Great Sea in the west will be your country
Jos  While you are living all will give way before you as I was with Moses so I will be with you I will not take away my help from you or give you up
Jos  Take heart and be strong for you will give to this people for their heritage the land which I gave by an oath to their fathers
Jos  Only take heart and be very strong take care to do all the law which Moses my servant gave you not turning from it to the right hand or to the left so that you may do well in all your undertakings
Jos  Let this book of the law be ever on your lips and in your thoughts day and night so that you may keep with care everything in it then a blessing will be on all your way and you will do well
Jos  Have I not given you your orders Take heart and be strong have no fear and do not be troubled for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go
Jos  Then Joshua gave their orders to those who were in authority over the people saying
Jos  Go through the tents and give orders to the people saying Get ready a store of food for in three days you are to go over this river Jordan and take for your heritage the land which the Lord your God is giving you
Jos  And to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the halftribe of Manasseh Joshua said
Jos  Keep in mind what Moses the servant of the Lord said to you The Lord your God is sending you rest and will give you this land
Jos  Your wives your little ones and your cattle will be kept here in the land which Moses gave you on this side of Jordan but you the fightingmen are to go over before your brothers armed to give them help
Jos  Till the Lord has given your brothers rest as he has given it to you and they have taken their heritage in the land which the Lord your God is giving them then you will go back to the land of your heritage which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you on the east side of Jordan
Jos  Then they said to Joshua in answer Whatever you say to us we will do and wherever you send us we will go
Jos  As we gave attention to Moses in all things so we will give attention to you and may the Lord your God be with you as he was with Moses
Jos  Whoever goes against your orders and does not give attention to all your words will be put to death only take heart and be strong
Jos  Then Joshua the son of Nun sent two men from Shittim secretly with the purpose of searching out the land and Jericho So they went and came to the house of a loose woman of the town named Rahab where they took their rest for the night
Jos  And it was said to the king of Jericho See some men have come here tonight from the children of Israel with the purpose of searching out the land
Jos  Then the king of Jericho sent to Rahab saying Send out the men who have come to you and are in your house for they have come with the purpose of searching out all the land
Jos  And the woman took the two men and put them in a secret place then she said Yes the men came to me but I had no idea where they came from
Jos  And when it was the time for shutting the doors at dark they went out I have no idea where the men went but if you go after them quickly you will overtake them
Jos  But she had taken them up to the roof covering them with the stems of flax which she had put out in order there
Jos  So the men went after them on the road to Jordan as far as the rivercrossing and when they had gone out after them the door into the town was shut
Jos  And before the men went to rest she came up to them on the roof
Jos  And said to them It is clear to me that the Lord has given you the land and that the fear of you has come on us
Jos  For we have had news of how the Lord made the Red Sea dry before you when you came out of Egypt and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites on the other side of Jordan to Sihon and Og whom you gave up to the curse
Jos  And because of this news our hearts became like water and there was no more spirit in any of us because of you for the Lord your God is God in heaven on high and here on earth
Jos  So now will you give me your oath by the Lord that because I have been kind to you you will be kind to my fathers house
Jos  And that you will keep safe my father and mother and my brothers and sisters and all they have so that death may not come on us
Jos  And the men said to her Our life for yours if you keep our business secret and when the Lord has given us the land we will keep faith and be kind to you
Jos  Then she let them down from the window by a cord for the house where she was living was on the town wall
Jos  And she said to them Get away into the hillcountry or the men who have gone after you will overtake you keep yourselves safe there for three days till the searchers have come back and then go on your way
Jos  And the men said to her We will only be responsible for this oath which you have made us take
Jos  If when we come into the land you put this cord of bright red thread in the window from which you let us down and get your father and mother and your brothers and all your family into the house
Jos  Then if anyone goes out of your house into the street his blood will be on his head we will not be responsible but if any damage comes to anyone in the house his blood will be on our heads
Jos  But if you say anything about our business here then we will be free from the oath you have made us take
Jos  And she said Let it be as you say Then she sent them away and they went and she put the bright red cord in the window
Jos  And they went into the hillcountry and were there three days till the men who had gone after them had come back and those who went after them were searching for them everywhere without coming across them
Jos  Then the two men came down from the hillcountry and went over and came back to Joshua the son of Nun and they gave him a complete account of what had taken place
Jos  And they said to Joshua Truly the Lord has given all the land into our hands and all the people of the land have become like water because of us
Jos  Then Joshua got up early in the morning and moving on from Shittim he and all the children of Israel came to Jordan and were there for the night before going over
Jos  And at the end of three days the men in authority over the people went through the tents
Jos  Giving the people their orders and saying When you see the ark of the agreement of the Lord your God lifted up by the priests the Levites then get up from your places and go after it
Jos  But let there be a space between you and it of about two thousand cubits come no nearer to it so that you may see the way you have to go for you have not been over this way before
Jos  And Joshua said to the people Make yourselves holy for tomorrow the Lord will do works of wonder among you
Jos  Then Joshua said to the priests Take up the ark of the agreement and go over in front of the people So they took up the ark of the agreement and went in front of the people
Jos  And the Lord said to Joshua From now on I will give you glory in the eyes of all Israel so that they may see that as I was with Moses so I will be with you
Jos  And you are to give orders to the priests who take up the ark of the agreement and say When you come to the edge of the waters of Jordan go no further
Jos  And Joshua said to the children of Israel Come to me here and give ear to the words of the Lord your God
Jos  And Joshua said By this you will see that the living God is among you and that he will certainly send out from before you the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Hivite and the Perizzite and the Girgashite and the Amorite and the Jebusite
Jos  See the ark of the agreement of the Lord of all the earth is going over before you into Jordan
Jos  So take twelve men out of the tribes of Israel a man from every tribe
Jos  And when the feet of the priests who take up the ark of the Lord the Lord of all the earth come to rest in the waters of Jordan the waters of Jordan will be cut off all the waters flowing down from higher up and will come together in a mass
Jos  So when the people went out from their tents to go over Jordan the priests who took up the ark of the agreement were in front of the people
Jos  And when those who took up the ark came to Jordan and the feet of the priests who took up the ark were touching the edge of the water for the waters of Jordan are overflowing all through the time of the graincutting
Jos  Then the waters flowing down from higher up were stopped and came together in a mass a long way back at Adam a town near Zarethan and the waters flowing down to the sea of the Arabah the Salt Sea were cut off and the people went across opposite Jericho
Jos  And the priests who took up the ark of the agreement of the Lord kept their places with their feet on dry land in the middle of Jordan while all Israel went over on dry land till all the nation had gone over Jordan
Jos  Now when all the nation had come to the other side of Jordan the Lord said to Joshua
Jos  Take twelve men from the people a man for every tribe
Jos  And say to them Take up from the middle of Jordan from the place where the feet of the priests were resting twelve stones and take them over with you and put them down in the place where you take your rest tonight
Jos  So Joshua sent for the twelve men whom he had ready one man out of every tribe of the children of Israel
Jos  And he said to them Go over before the ark of the Lord your God into the middle of Jordan and let every one of you take up a stone on his back one for every tribe of the children of Israel
Jos  So that this may be a sign among you when your children say to you in time to come What is the reason for these stones
Jos  Then you will say to them Because the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the Lords agreement when it went over Jordan the waters of Jordan were cut off and these stones will be a sign for the children of Israel keeping it in their memory for ever
Jos  So the children of Israel did as Joshua gave them orders and took twelve stones from the middle of Jordan as the Lord had said to Joshua one for every tribe of the children of Israel these they took across with them to their nights restingplace and put them down there
Jos  And Joshua put up twelve stones in the middle of Jordan where the feet of the priests who took up the ark of the agreement had been placed and there they are to this day
Jos  For the priests who took up the ark kept there in the middle of Jordan till all the orders given to Joshua by Moses from the Lord had been done then the people went over quickly
Jos  And when all the people had come to the other side the ark of the Lord went over and the priests before the eyes of the people
Jos  And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the halftribe of Manasseh went over armed before the children of Israel as Moses had said to them
Jos  About forty thousand armed for war went over before the Lord to the fight to the lowlands of Jericho
Jos  That day the Lord made Joshua great in the eyes of all Israel and all the days of his life they went in fear of him as they had gone in fear of Moses
Jos  Then the Lord said to Joshua
Jos  Give orders to the priests who take up the ark of witness to come up out of Jordan
Jos  So Joshua gave orders to the priests saying Come up now out of Jordan
Jos  And when the priests who took up the ark of the Lords agreement came up out of Jordan and their feet came out on to dry land the waters of Jordan went back to their place overflowing its edges as before
Jos  So on the tenth day of the first month the people came up out of Jordan and put up their tents in Gilgal on the east side of Jericho
Jos  And the twelve stones which they took out of Jordan Joshua put up in Gilgal
Jos  And he said to the children of Israel When your children say to their fathers in time to come What is the reason for these stones
Jos  Then give your children the story and say Israel came over this river Jordan on dry land
Jos  For the Lord your God made the waters of Jordan dry before you till you had gone across as he did to the Red Sea drying it up before us till we had gone across
Jos  So that all the peoples of the earth may see that the hand of the Lord is strong and that they may go in fear of the Lord your God for ever
Jos  Now when the news came to all the kings of the Amorites on the west side of Jordan and all the kings of the Canaanites living by the sea how the Lord had made the waters of Jordan dry before the children of Israel till they had gone across their hearts became like water and there was no more spirit in them because of the children of Israel
Jos  At that time the Lord said to Joshua Make yourself stone knives and give the children of Israel circumcision a second time
Jos  So Joshua made stone knives and gave the children of Israel circumcision at Gibeathhaaraloth
Jos  And this is the reason why Joshua did so all the males of the people who came out of Egypt all the fightingmen had been overtaken by death in the waste land on the way after they came out of Egypt
Jos  All the people who came out had undergone circumcision but all the people whose birth had taken place in the waste land on their journey from Egypt had not
Jos  For the children of Israel were wandering in the waste land for forty years till all the nation that is all the fightingmen who had come out of Egypt were dead because they did not give ear to the voice of the Lord to whom the Lord said with an oath that he would not let them see the land which the Lord had given his word to their fathers to give us a land flowing with milk and honey
Jos  And their children who came up in their place now underwent circumcision by the hands of Joshua not having had it before for there had been no circumcision on the journey
Jos  So when all the nation had undergone circumcision they kept in their tents till they were well again
Jos  And the Lord said to Joshua Today the shame of Egypt has been rolled away from you So that place was named Gilgal to this day
Jos  So the children of Israel put up their tents in Gilgal and they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening in the lowlands of Jericho
Jos  And on the day after the Passover they had for their food the produce of the land unleavened cakes and dry grain on the same day
Jos  And there was no more manna from the day after they had for their food the produce of the land the children of Israel had manna no longer but that year the produce of the land of Canaan was their food
Jos  Now when Joshua was near Jericho lifting up his eyes he saw a man in front of him with his sword uncovered in his hand and Joshua went up to him and said Are you for us or against us
Jos  And he said No but I have come as captain of the armies of the Lord Then Joshua falling down with his face to the earth in worship said What has my lord to say to his servant
Jos  And the captain of the Lords army said to Joshua Take off your shoes from your feet for the place where you are is holy And Joshua did so
Jos  Now Jericho was all shut up because of the children of Israel there was no going out or coming in
Jos  And the Lord said to Joshua See I have given into your hands Jericho with its king and all its men of war
Jos  Now let all your fightingmen make a circle round the town going all round it once Do this for six days
Jos  And let seven priests go before the ark with seven loudsounding horns in their hands on the seventh day you are to go round the town seven times the priests blowing their horns
Jos  And at the sound of a long note on the horns let all the people give a loud cry and the wall of the town will come down flat and all the people are to go straight forward
Jos  Then Joshua the son of Nun sent for the priests and said to them Take up the ark of the agreement and let seven priests take seven horns in their hands and go before the ark of the Lord
Jos  And he said to the people Go forward circling the town and let the armed men go before the ark of the Lord
Jos  So after Joshua had said this to the people the seven priests with their seven horns went forward before the Lord blowing on their horns and the ark of the Lords agreement went after them
Jos  And the armed men went before the priests who were blowing the horns and the mass of the people went after the ark blowing their horns
Jos  And to the people Joshua gave an order saying You will give no cry and make no sound and let no word go out of your mouth till the day when I say Give a loud cry then give a loud cry
Jos  So he made the ark of the Lord go all round the town once then they went back to the tents for the night
Jos  And early in the morning Joshua got up and the priests took up the ark of the Lord
Jos  And the seven priests with their seven horns went on before the ark of the Lord blowing their horns the armed men went before them and the mass of the people went after the ark of the Lord blowing their horns
Jos  The second day they went all round the town once and then went back to their tents and so they did for six days
Jos  Then on the seventh day they got up early at the dawn of the day and went round the town in the same way but that day they went round it seven times
Jos  And the seventh time at the sound of the priests horns Joshua said to the people Now give a loud cry for the Lord has given you the town
Jos  And the town will be put to the curse and everything in it will be given to the Lord only Rahab the loose woman and all who are in the house with her will be kept safe because she kept secret the men we sent
Jos  And as for you keep yourselves from the cursed thing for fear that you may get a desire for it and take some of it for yourselves and so be the cause of a curse and great trouble on the tents of Israel
Jos  But all the silver and gold and the vessels of brass and iron are holy to the Lord they are to come into the storehouse of the Lord
Jos  So the people gave a loud cry and the horns were sounded and on hearing the horns the people gave a loud cry and the wall came down flat so that the people went up into the town every man going straight before him and they took the town
Jos  And they put everything in the town to the curse men and women young and old ox and sheep and ass they put to death without mercy
Jos  Then Joshua said to the two men who had been sent to make a search through the land Go into the house of the loose woman and get her out and all who are with her as you gave her your oath
Jos  So the searchers went in and got out Rahab and her father and mother and her brothers and all she had and they got out all her family and they took them outside the tents of Israel
Jos  Then after burning up the town and everything in it they put the silver and gold and the vessels of brass and iron into the storehouse of the Lords house
Jos  But Joshua kept Rahab the loose woman and her fathers family and all she had from death and so she got a livingplace among the children of Israel to this day because she kept safe the men whom Joshua had sent to make a search through the land
Jos  Then Joshua gave the people orders with an oath saying Let that man be cursed before the Lord who puts his hand to the building up of this town with the loss of his first son will he put the first stone of it in place and with the loss of his youngest son he will put up its doors
Jos  So the Lord was with Joshua and news of him went through all the land
Jos  But the children of Israel did wrong about the cursed thing for Achan the son of Carmi the son of Zabdi the son of Zerah of the family of Judah took of the cursed thing moving the Lord to wrath against the children of Israel
Jos  Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai which is by the side of Bethaven on the east side of Bethel and said to them Go up and make a search through the land And the men went up and saw how Ai was placed
Jos  Then they came back to Joshua and said to him Do not send all the people up but let about two or three thousand men go up and make an attack on Ai there is no need for all the people to be tired with the journey there for it is only a small town
Jos  So about three thousand of the people went up and were sent in flight by the men of Ai
Jos  The men of Ai put to death about thirtysix of them driving them from before the town as far as the stoneworks and overcoming them on the way down and the hearts of the people became like water
Jos  Then Joshua in great grief went down on the earth before the ark of the Lord till the evening and all the chiefs of Israel with him and they put dust on their heads
Jos  And Joshua said O Lord God why have you taken us over Jordan only to give us up into the hands of the Amorites for our destruction If only it had been enough for us to keep on the other side of Jordan
Jos  O Lord what am I to say now that Israel have given way before their attackers
Jos  For when the news comes to the Canaanites and all the people of the land they will come up shutting us in and cutting off our name from the earth and what will you do for the honour of your great name
Jos  Then the Lord said to Joshua Get up what are you doing with your face to the earth
Jos  Israel has done wrong sinning against the agreement which I made with them they have even taken of the cursed thing acting falsely like thieves they have put it among their goods
Jos  For this reason the children of Israel have given way turning their backs in flight before their attackers because they are cursed I will no longer be with you if you do not put the cursed thing away from among you
Jos  Up make the people holy say to them Make yourselves holy before tomorrow for the Lord the God of Israel has said There is a cursed thing among you O Israel and you will give way before your attackers in the fight till the cursed thing has been taken away from among you
Jos  So in the morning you are to come near tribe by tribe and the tribe marked out by the Lord is to come near family by family and the family marked out by the Lord is to come near house by house and the house marked out by the Lord is to come near man by man
Jos  Then the man who is taken with the cursed thing is to be burned with everything which is his because he has gone against the agreement of the Lord and has done an act of shame in Israel
Jos  So Joshua got up early in the morning and made Israel come before him by their tribes and the tribe of Judah was taken
Jos  Then he made Judah come forward and the family of the Zerahites was taken and he made the family of the Zerahites come forward man by man and Zabdi was taken
Jos  Then the house of Zabdi came forward man by man and Achan the son of Carmi the son of Zabdi the son of Zerah of the tribe of Judah was taken
Jos  And Joshua said to Achan My son give glory and praise to the Lord the God of Israel give me word now of what you have done and keep nothing back from me
Jos  And Achan answering said to Joshua Truly I have done wrong against the Lord the God of Israel and this is what I have done
Jos  When I saw among their goods a fair robe of Babylon and two hundred shekels of silver and a mass of gold fifty shekels in weight I was overcome by desire and took them and they are put away in the earth in my tent and the silver is under it
Jos  So Joshua sent men quickly and looking in his tent they saw where the robe had been put away secretly with the silver under it
Jos  And they took them from the tent and came back with them to Joshua and the children of Israel and put them before the Lord
Jos  Then Joshua and all Israel took Achan the son of Zerah and the silver and the robe and the mass of gold and his sons and his daughters and his oxen and his asses and his sheep and his tent and everything he had and they took them up into the valley of Achor
Jos  And Joshua said Why have you been a cause of trouble to us Today the Lord will send trouble on you And all Israel took part in stoning him they had him stoned to death and then burned with fire
Jos  And over him they put a great mass of stones which is there to this day then the heat of the Lords wrath was turned away So that place was named The Valley of Achor to this day
Jos  Then the Lord said to Joshua Have no fear and do not be troubled take with you all the fightingmen and go up against Ai for I have given into your hands the king of Ai and his people and his town and his land
Jos  And you are to do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king but their goods and their cattle you may take for yourselves let a secret force be stationed to make a surprise attack on the town from the back
Jos  So Joshua and the fightingmen got ready to go up against Ai and Joshua took thirty thousand men of war and sent them out by night
Jos  And he gave them their orders saying Go and take up your position secretly at the back of the town do not go very far away and let all of you be ready
Jos  And I and all the people with me will come near the town and when they come out against us as they did before we will go in flight from them
Jos  And they will come out after us till we have got them away from the town for they will say They have gone in flight from us as before so we will go in flight before them
Jos  Then you will get up from your secret position and take the town for the Lord your God will give it up into your hands
Jos  And when you have taken the town put fire to it as the Lord has said see I have given you your orders
Jos  So Joshua sent them out and they took up a secret position between Bethel and Ai on the west side of Ai but Joshua kept with the people that night
Jos  And early in the morning Joshua got up and put the people in order and he and the chiefs of Israel went up before the people to Ai
Jos  And all the fightingmen who were with him went up and came near the town and took up a position on the north side of Ai facing the town with a valley between him and the town
Jos  And taking about five thousand men he put them in position for a surprise attack on the west side of Ai between Bethel and Ai
Jos  So all the people were in their places the army on the north side of the town and the secret force on the west and that night Joshua went down into the valley
Jos  Now when the king of Ai saw it he got up quickly and went out to war against Israel he and all his people to the slope going down to the valley but he had no idea that a secret force was waiting at the back of the town
Jos  Then Joshua and all Israel acting as if they were overcome before them went in flight by way of the waste land
Jos  And all the people in Ai came together to go after them and they went after Joshua moving away from the town
Jos  There was not a man in Ai and Bethel who did not go out after Israel and the town was open and unwatched while they went after Israel
Jos  And the Lord said to Joshua Let your spear be stretched out against Ai for I will give it into your hands So Joshua took up his spear stretching it out in the direction of the town
Jos  Then the secret force came quickly from their place and running forward when they saw his hand stretched out went into the town and took it and put fire to it straight away
Jos  Then the men of Ai looking back saw the smoke of the town going up to heaven and were unable to go this way or that and the people who had gone in flight to the waste land were turned back on those who were coming after them
Jos  And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the town had been taken by the surprise attack and that the smoke of the town had gone up turning round they overcame the men of Ai
Jos  Then the other force came out of the town against them so that they were being attacked on this side and on that and Israel overcame them and let not one of them get away with his life
Jos  But the king of Ai they made prisoner and took him to Joshua
Jos  Then after the destruction of all the people of Ai in the field and in the waste land where they went after them and when all the people had been put to death without mercy all Israel went back to Ai and put to death all who were in it without mercy
Jos  On that day twelve thousand were put to death men and women all the people of Ai
Jos  For Joshua did not take back his hand with the outstretched spear till the destruction of the people of Ai was complete
Jos  But the cattle and the goods from that town Israel took for themselves as the Lord had given orders to Joshua
Jos  So Joshua gave Ai to the flames and made it a waste mass of stones for ever as it is to this day
Jos  And he put the king of Ai to death hanging him on a tree till evening and when the sun went down Joshua gave them orders to take his body down from the tree and put it in the public place of the town covering it with a great mass of stones which is there to this day
Jos  Then Joshua put up an altar to the Lord the God of Israel in Mount Ebal
Jos  In the way ordered by Moses the servant of the Lord as it is recorded in the book of the law of Moses an altar of uncut stones untouched by any iron instrument and on it they made burned offerings and peaceofferings to the Lord
Jos  And he made there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses writing it before the eyes of the children of Israel
Jos  And all Israel those who were Israelites by birth as well as the men from other lands living with them and their responsible men and their overseers and judges took their places round the ark in front of the priests the Levites whose work it was to take up the ark of the Lords agreement half of them were stationed in front of Mount Gerizim and half in front of Mount Ebal in agreement with the orders for the blessing of the children of Israel which Moses the servant of the Lord had given
Jos  And after he gave them all the words of the law the blessing and the curse as it is all recorded in the book of the law
Jos  Reading to all the meeting of Israel with the women and the children and the men from other lands who were living among them every word of the orders which Moses had given
Jos  Now on hearing the news of these things all the kings on the west side of Jordan in the hillcountry and the lowlands and by the Great Sea in front of Lebanon the Hittites and the Amorites the Canaanites the Perizzites the Hivites and the Jebusites
Jos  Came together with one purpose to make war against Joshua and Israel
Jos  And the men of Gibeon hearing what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai
Jos  Acting with deceit got food together as if for a long journey and took old foodbags for their asses and old and cracked wineskins kept together with cord
Jos  And put old stitchedup shoes on their feet and old clothing on their backs and all the food they had with them was dry and broken up
Jos  And they came to Joshua to the tentcircle at Gilgal and said to him and to the men of Israel We have come from a far country so now make an agreement with us
Jos  And the men of Israel said to the Hivites It may be that you are living among us how then may we make an agreement with you
Jos  And they said to Joshua We are your servants Then Joshua said to them Who are you and where do you come from
Jos  And they said to him Your servants have come from a very far country because of the name of the Lord your God for the story of his great name and of all he did in Egypt has come to our ears
Jos  And what he did to the two kings of the Amorites east of Jordan to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan at Ashtaroth
Jos  So the responsible men and all the people of our country said to us Take food with you for the journey and go to them and say to them We are your servants so now make an agreement with us
Jos  This bread which we have with us for our food we took warm and new from our houses when starting on our journey to you but now see it has become dry and broken up
Jos  And these wineskins were new when we put the wine in them and now they are cracked as you see and our clothing and our shoes have become old because of our very long journey here
Jos  And the men took some of their food without requesting directions from the Lord
Jos  So Joshua made peace with them and made an agreement with them that they were not to be put to death and the chiefs of the people took an oath to them
Jos  Now three days after when they had made this agreement with them they had word that these men were their neighbours living near them
Jos  And the children of Israel went forward on their journey and on the third day came to their towns Now their towns were Gibeon and Chephirah and Beeroth and Kiriathjearim
Jos  And the children of Israel did not put them to death because the chiefs of the people had taken an oath to them by the Lord the God of Israel And all the people made an outcry against the chiefs
Jos  But all the chiefs said to the people We have taken an oath to them by the Lord the God of Israel and so we may not put our hands on them
Jos  This is what we will do to them we will not put them to death for fear that wrath may come on us because of our oath to them
Jos  Keep them living and let them be servants cutting wood and getting water for all the people And all the people did as the chiefs had said to them
Jos  Then Joshua sent for them and said to them Why have you been false to us saying We are very far from you when you are living among us
Jos  Now because of this you are cursed and you will for ever be our servants cutting wood and getting water for the house of my God
Jos  And answering Joshua they said Because it came to the ears of your servants that the Lord your God had given orders to his servant Moses to give you all this land and to send destruction on all the people living in it because of you so fearing greatly for our lives because of you we have done this
Jos  And now we are in your hands do to us whatever seems good and right to you
Jos  So he kept them safe from the children of Israel and did not let them be put to death
Jos  And that day Joshua made them servants cutting wood and getting water for the people and for the altar of the Lord in the place marked out by him to this day
Jos  Now when it came to the ears of Adonizedek king of Jerusalem that Joshua had taken Ai and had given it up to the curse for as he had done to Jericho and its king so he had done to Ai and its king and that the people of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were living among them
Jos  He was in great fear because Gibeon was a great town like one of the kings towns greater than Ai and all the men in it were men of war
Jos  So Adonizedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron and to Piram king of Jarmuth and to Japhia king of Lachish and to Debir king of Eglon saying
Jos  Come up to me and give me help and let us make an attack on Gibeon for they have made peace with Joshua and the children of Israel
Jos  So the five kings of the Amorites the king of Jerusalem the king of Hebron the king of Jarmuth the king of Lachish and the king of Eglon were banded together and went up with all their armies and took up their position before Gibeon and made war against it
Jos  And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the tentcircle at Gilgal saying Be not slow to send help to your servants come up quickly to our support and keep us safe for all the kings of the Amorites from the hillcountry have come together against us
Jos  So Joshua went up from Gilgal with all his army and all his men of war
Jos  And the Lord said to Joshua Have no fear of them for I have given them into your hands they will all give way before you
Jos  So Joshua having come up from Gilgal all night made a sudden attack on them
Jos  And the Lord made them full of fear before Israel and they put great numbers of them to death at Gibeon and went after them by the way going up to Bethhoron driving them back to Azekah and Makkedah
Jos  And in their flight before Israel on the way down from Bethhoron the Lord sent down great stones from heaven on them all the way to Azekah causing their death those whose death was caused by the stones were more than those whom the children of Israel put to death with the sword
Jos  It was on the day when the Lord gave up the Amorites into the hands of the children of Israel that Joshua said to the Lord before the eyes of Israel Sun be at rest over Gibeon and you O moon in the valley of Aijalon
Jos  And the sun was at rest and the moon kept its place till the nation had given punishment to their attackers Is it not recorded in the book of Jashar So the sun kept its place in the middle of the heavens and was waiting and did not go down for the space of a day
Jos  And there was no day like that before it or after it when the Lord gave ear to the voice of a man for the Lord was fighting for Israel
Jos  And Joshua with all Israel went back to the tentcircle at Gilgal
Jos  But these five kings went in flight secretly to a hole in the rock at Makkedah
Jos  And word was given to Joshua that the five kings had been taken in a hole in the rock at Makkedah
Jos  And Joshua said Let great stones be rolled against the mouth of the hole and let men keep watch by it
Jos  But do you without waiting go after their army attacking them from the back do not let them get into their towns for the Lord your God has given them into your hands
Jos  Now when Joshua and the children of Israel had come to the end of their war of complete destruction and had put to death all but a small band who had got safely into the walled towns
Jos  All the people went back to Joshua to the tentcircle at Makkedah in peace and no one said a word against the children of Israel
Jos  Then Joshua said Take away the stones from the mouth of the hole in the rock and make those five kings come out to me
Jos  And they did so and made those five kings come out of the hole to him the king of Jerusalem the king of Hebron the king of Jarmuth the king of Lachish and the king of Eglon
Jos  And when they had made those kings come out to Joshua Joshua sent for all the men of Israel and said to the chiefs of the men of war who had gone with him Come near and put your feet on the necks of these kings So they came near and put their feet on their necks
Jos  And Joshua said to them Have no fear and do not be troubled be strong and take heart for so will the Lord do to all against whom you make war
Jos  Then Joshua had them put to death hanging them on five trees where they were till evening
Jos  And when the sun went down they were taken down from the trees by Joshuas orders and put into the hole where they had gone to be safe and great stones were placed at the mouth of the hole where they are to this day
Jos  That day Joshua took Makkedah and put it and its king to the sword every soul in it he gave up to the curse without mercy and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho
Jos  Then Joshua and all Israel with him went on from Makkedah and came to Libnah and made an attack on it
Jos  And again the Lord gave it and its king into the hands of Israel and he put it and every person in it to the sword till their destruction was complete and he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho
Jos  Then Joshua and all Israel with him went on from Libnah to Lachish and took up their position against it and made an attack on it
Jos  And the Lord gave Lachish into the hands of Israel and on the second day he took it putting it and every person in it to the sword without mercy as he had done to Libnah
Jos  Then Horam king of Gezer came up to the help of Lachish and Joshua overcame him and his people putting all of them to death
Jos  And Joshua and all Israel with him went on from Lachish to Eglon and they took up their position against it and made an attack on it
Jos  And that day they took it putting it and every person in it to the sword as he had done to Lachish
Jos  And Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron and made an attack on it
Jos  And took it overcoming it and putting it and its king and its towns and every person in it to the sword as he had done to Eglon he put them all to death and gave it up to the curse with every person in it
Jos  And Joshua and all Israel with him went on to make an attack on Debir
Jos  And he took it with its king and all its towns and he put them to the sword giving every person in it to the curse all were put to death as he had done to Hebron so he did to Debir and its king
Jos  So Joshua overcame all the land the hillcountry and the South and the lowland and the mountain slopes and all their kings all were put to death and every living thing he gave up to the curse as the Lord the God of Israel had given him orders
Jos  Joshua overcame them from Kadeshbarnea to Gaza and all the land of Goshen as far as Gibeon
Jos  And all these kings and their land Joshua took at the same time because the Lord the God of Israel was fighting for Israel
Jos  Then Joshua and all Israel with him went back to their tents at Gilgal
Jos  Now Jabin king of Hazor hearing of these things sent to Jobab king of Madon and to the king of Shimron and to the king of Achshaph
Jos  And to the kings on the north in the hillcountry and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth and in the lowland and in the highlands of Dor on the west
Jos  And to the Canaanites on the east and on the west and to the Amorites and the Hittites and the Perizzites and the Jebusites in the hillcountry and the Hivites under Hermon in the land of Mizpah
Jos  And they went out they and all their armies with them a great people in number like the sand on the seaside with horses and warcarriages in great number
Jos  And all these kings came together and put their forces in position at the waters of Merom to make war on Israel
Jos  And the Lord said to Joshua Have no fear of them for tomorrow at this time I will give them all up dead before Israel you are to have the legmuscles of their horses cut and their warcarriages burned with fire
Jos  So Joshua and all the men of war with him came against them suddenly at the waters of Merom and made an attack on them
Jos  And the Lord gave them up into the hands of Israel and they overcame them driving them back to great Zidon and to Misrephothmaim and into the valley of Mizpeh to the east and they put them all to death no man got away safely
Jos  And Joshua did to them as the Lord had said to him he had the legmuscles of their horses cut and their warcarriages burned with fire
Jos  At that time Joshua went on to take Hazor and put its king to the sword for in earlier times Hazor was the chief of all those kingdoms
Jos  And they put every person in it to death without mercy giving every living thing up to the curse and burning Hazor
Jos  And all the towns of these kings and all the kings Joshua took and put them to the sword he gave them up to the curse as Moses the servant of the Lord had said
Jos  As for the towns made on hills of earth not one was burned by Israel but Hazor which was burned by Joshua
Jos  And all the goods taken from these towns and their cattle the children of Israel kept for themselves but every man they put to death without mercy till their destruction was complete and there was no one living
Jos  As the Lord had given orders to Moses his servant so Moses gave orders to Joshua and so Joshua did every order which the Lord had given to Moses was done
Jos  So Joshua took all that land the hillcountry and all the South and all the land of Goshen and the lowland and the Arabah the hillcountry of Israel and its lowland
Jos  From Mount Halak which goes up to Seir as far as Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon and all their kings he overcame and put to death
Jos  For a long time Joshua made war on all those kings
Jos  Not one town made peace with the children of Israel but only the Hivites of Gibeon they took them all in war
Jos  For the Lord made them strong in heart to go to war against Israel so that he might give them up to the curse without mercy and that destruction might come on them as the Lord had given orders to Moses
Jos  And Joshua came at that time and put an end to the Anakim in the hillcountry in Hebron in Debir in Anab and in all the hillcountry of Judah and Israel Joshua gave them and their towns to the curse
Jos  Not one of the Anakim was to be seen in the land of the children of Israel only in Gaza in Gath and in Ashdod some were still living
Jos  So Joshua took all the land as the Lord had said to Moses and Joshua gave it to the children of Israel as their heritage making division of it among them by their tribes And the land had rest from war
Jos  Now these are the kings of the land whom the children of Israel overcame taking as their heritage their land on the east side of Jordan from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon and all the Arabah to the east
Jos  Sihon king of the Amorites who was living in Heshbon ruling from Aroer which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon and the town in the middle of the valley and half Gilead as far as the river Jabbok the limits of the children of Ammon
Jos  And the Arabah to the sea of Chinneroth to the east and to the sea of the Arabah that is the Salt Sea to the east the way to Bethjeshimoth and on the south under the slopes of Pisgah
Jos  And the land of Og king of Bashan of the rest of the Rephaim who was living at Ashtaroth and at Edrei
Jos  Ruling in the mountain of Hermon and in Salecah and in all Bashan as far as the limits of the Geshurites and the Maacathites and half Gilead to the land of Sihon king of Heshbon
Jos  Moses the servant of the Lord and the children of Israel overcame them and Moses the servant of the Lord gave their land for a heritage to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the halftribe of Manasseh
Jos  And these are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the children of Israel overcame on the west side of Jordan from Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak which goes up to Seir and Joshua gave the land to the tribes of Israel for a heritage in keeping with their divisions
Jos  In the hillcountry and in the lowland and in the Arabah and on the mountain slopes and in the waste land and in the South the Hittites the Amorites and the Canaanites the Perizzites the Hivites and the Jebusites
Jos  The king of Jericho one the king of Ai which is near Bethel one

Jos  The king of Debir one the king of Geder one
Jos  The king of Hormah one the king of Arad one
Jos  The king of Libnah one the king of Adullam one
Jos  The king of Makkedah one the king of Bethel one
Jos  The king of Tappuah one the king of Hepher one
Jos  The king of Aphek one the king of Lassharon one
Jos  The king of Madon one the king of Hazor one
Jos  The king of Shimronmeron one the king of Achshaph one

Jos  The king of Kedesh one the king of Jokneam in Carmel one
Jos  The king of Dor on the hill of Dor one the king of Goiim in Gilgal one
Jos  The king of Tirzah one all the kings together were thirtyone
Jos  Now Joshua was old and full of years and the Lord said to him You are old and full of years and there is still very much land to be taken
Jos  This is the land which is still to be taken all the country of the Philistines and all the Geshurites
Jos  From the Shihor which is before Egypt to the edge of Ekron to the north which is taken to be Canaanite property the five chiefs of the Philistines the Gazites and the Ashdodites the Ashkelonites the Gittites and the Ekronites as well as the Avvim
Jos  On the south all the land of the Canaanites and Mearah which is the property of the Zidonians to Aphek as far as the limit of the Amorites
Jos  And the land of the Gebalites and all Lebanon looking east from Baalgad under Mount Hermon as far as Hamath
Jos  All the people of the hillcountry from Lebanon to Misrephothmaim all the Zidonians them will I send out from before the children of Israel only make division of it to Israel for a heritage as I have given you orders to do
Jos  So now make division of this land for a heritage to the nine tribes and the halftribe of Manasseh
Jos  With him the Reubenites and the Gadites have been given their heritage which Moses gave them on the east side of Jordan as Moses the servant of the Lord gave them
Jos  From Aroer on the edge of the valley of the Arnon and the town in the middle of the valley and all the tableland from Medeba to Dibon
Jos  And all the towns of Sihon king of the Amorites who was ruling in Heshbon to the limits of the children of Ammon
Jos  And Gilead and the land of the Geshurites and the Maacathites and all Mount Hermon and all Bashan to Salecah
Jos  All the kingdom of Og in Bashan who was ruling in Ashtaroth and in Edrei he was one of the last of the Rephaim these did Moses overcome driving them out of their country
Jos  However the people of Israel did not send out the Geshurites or the Maacathites but Geshur and Maacath are living among Israel to this day
Jos  Only to the tribe of Levi he gave no heritage the offerings of the Lord the God of Israel made by fire are his heritage as he said to him
Jos  And Moses gave their heritage to the tribe of Reuben by their families
Jos  Their limit was from Aroer on the edge of the valley of the Arnon and the town in the middle of the valley and all the tableland by Medeba
Jos  Heshbon and all her towns in the tableland Dibon and Bamothbaal and Bethbaalmeon
Jos  And Jahaz and Kedemoth and Mephaath
Jos  And Kiriathaim and Sibmah and Zerethshahar in the mountain of the valley
Jos  And Bethpeor and the slopes of Pisgah and Bethjeshimoth
Jos  And all the towns of the tableland and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites who was ruling in Heshbon whom Moses overcame together with the chiefs of Midian Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba the chiefs of Sihon who were living in the land
Jos  And Balaam the son of Beor the prophet the children of Israel put to death with the sword
Jos  And the limit of the children of Reuben was the edge of Jordan This was the heritage of the children of Reuben by their families with its towns and its unwalled places
Jos  And Moses gave their heritage to the tribe of Gad by their families
Jos  And their limit was Jazer and all the towns of Gilead and half the land of the children of Ammon to Aroer before Rabbah
Jos  And from Heshbon to Ramathmizpeh and Betonim and from Mahanaim to the edge of Debir
Jos  And in the valley Bethharam and Bethnimrah and Succoth and Zaphon the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon having Jordan for its limit to the end of the sea of Chinnereth on the east side of Jordan
Jos  This is the heritage of the children of Gad by their families with its towns and its unwalled places
Jos  And Moses gave their heritage to the halftribe of Manasseh by their families
Jos  And their limit was from Mahanaim all Bashan all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan and all HavvothJair in Bashan sixty towns
Jos  And half Gilead and Ashtaroth and Edrei towns of the kingdom of Og in Bashan were for the children of Machir the son of Manasseh for half of the children of Machir by their families
Jos  These are the heritages of which Moses made distribution in the lowlands of Moab on the other side of Jordan in Jericho to the east
Jos  But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no heritage the Lord the God of Israel is their heritage as he said to them
Jos  And these are the heritages which the children of Israel took in the land of Canaan which Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel gave out to them
Jos  Their heritage by the Lords decision as he gave orders by Moses for the nine tribes and the halftribe
Jos  For Moses had given their heritage to the two tribes and the halftribe on the other side of Jordan but to the Levites he gave no heritage among them
Jos  Because the children of Joseph were two tribes Manasseh and Ephraim and they gave the Levites no part in the land only towns for their livingplaces with the grasslands for their cattle and for their property
Jos  As the Lord had given orders to Moses so the people of Israel did and they made division of the land
Jos  Then the children of Judah went to Joshua in Gilgal and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him You have knowledge of what the Lord said to Moses the man of God about me and about you in Kadeshbarnea
Jos  I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadeshbarnea to make a search through the land and the account which I gave him was in keeping with his desire
Jos  My brothers however who went up with me made the heart of the people like water but I was true to the Lord with all my heart
Jos  And on that day Moses took an oath saying Truly the land where your feet have been placed will become a heritage for you and your children for ever because you have been true to the Lord your God with all your heart
Jos  And now as you see the Lord has kept me safe these fortyfive years from the time when the Lord said this to Moses while Israel was wandering in the waste land and now I am eightyfive years old
Jos  And still I am as strong today as I was when Moses sent me out as my strength was then so is it now for war and for all the business of life
Jos  So now give me this hillcountry named by the Lord at that time for you had an account of it then how the Anakim were there and great walled towns it may be that the Lord will be with me and I will be able to take their land as the Lord said
Jos  And Joshua gave him his blessing and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his heritage
Jos  So Hebron became the heritage of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day because with all his heart he was true to the Lord the God of Israel
Jos  In earlier times the name of Hebron had been Kiriatharba named after Arba the greatest of the Anakim And the land had rest from war
Jos  Now the part of the land marked out for the children of Judah by families went up to the edge of Edom as far as the waste land of Zin to the south to the farthest point of it on the south
Jos  Their south limit was from the farthest part of the Salt Sea from the inlet looking to the south
Jos  From there it goes south of the slope up to Akrabbim and on to Zin then south past Kadeshbarnea and on by Hezron and up to Addar turning in the direction of Karka
Jos  Then on to Azmon ending at the stream of Egypt and the end of the limit is at the sea this will be your limit on the south
Jos  And the east limit is the Salt Sea as far as the end of Jordan And the limit of the north part of the land is from the inlet of the sea at the end of Jordan
Jos  Then the line goes up to Bethhoglah past the north of Betharabah and up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben
Jos  Then the line goes up to Debir from the valley of Achor and so to the north in the direction of Gilgal which is opposite the slope up to Adummim on the south side of the river and the line goes on to the waters of Enshemesh ending at Enrogel
Jos  Then the line goes up by the valley of the son of Hinnom to the south side of the Jebusite which is Jerusalem then up to the top of the mountain in front of the valley of Hinnom to the west which is at the farthest point of the valley of Rephaim on the north
Jos  And the limit is marked out from the top of the mountain to the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah and out to the towns of Mount Ephron as far as Baalah which is Kiriathjearim
Jos  Then turning west the line goes from Baalah to Mount Seir and on to the side of Mount Jearim which is Chesalon on the north then down to Bethshemesh and on past Timnah
Jos  And out to the side of Ekron to the north then it is marked out to Shikkeron and on to Mount Baalah ending at Jabneel the end of the line is at the sea
Jos  And the limit on the west is the edge of the Great Sea This is the line going round the land marked out for the children of Judah by their families
Jos  And to Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah as the Lord had given orders to Joshua that is Kiriatharba named after Arba the father of Anak which is Hebron
Jos  And the three sons of Anak Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai the children of Anak were forced out from there by Caleb
Jos  From there he went up against the people of Debir now the name of Debir before that was Kiriathsepher
Jos  And Caleb said I will give Achsah my daughter as wife to the man who overcomes Kiriathsepher and takes it
Jos  And Othniel the son of Kenaz Calebs brother took it so he gave him his daughter Achsah for his wife
Jos  Now when she came to him he put into her mind the idea of requesting a field from her father and she got down from her ass and Caleb said to her What is it
Jos  And she said Give me a blessing because you have put me in dry southland now give me springs of water So he gave her the higher spring and the lower spring
Jos  This is the heritage of the tribe of Judah by their families

Jos  And Nibshan and the Town of Salt and Engedi six towns with their unwalled places
Jos  And as for the Jebusites living in Jerusalem the children of Judah were unable to make them go out but the Jebusites are living with the children of Judah at Jerusalem to this day
Jos  And the limit of the land marked out for the children of Joseph went out from Jordan at Jericho at the waters of Jericho on the east in the waste land going up from Jericho through the hillcountry to Bethel
Jos  And it goes out from Bethel to Luz and on as far as the limit of the Archites to Ataroth
Jos  And it goes down to the west to the limit of the Japhletites to the limit of Bethhoron the lower as far as Gezer ending at the sea
Jos  And the children of Joseph Manasseh and Ephraim took their heritage
Jos  And the limit of the land of the children of Ephraim by their families was marked out in this way the limit of their heritage to the east was Atarothaddar to Bethhoron the higher
Jos  The line goes out to the west at Michmethath on the north then turning to the east to Taanathshiloh going past it on the east of Janoah
Jos  And from Janoah down to Ataroth and to Naarah and touching Jericho it goes on to Jordan
Jos  From Tappuah the line goes on to the west to the river of Kanah ending at the sea This is the heritage of the children of Ephraim by their families
Jos  Together with the towns marked out for the children of Ephraim in the heritage of Manasseh all the towns with their unwalled places
Jos  And the Canaanites who were living in Gezer were not forced out but the Canaanites have been living among Ephraim to this day as servants doing forced work
Jos  And this was the part marked out for the tribe of Manasseh because he was the oldest son of Joseph As for Machir the oldest son of Manasseh the father of Gilead because he was a man of war he had Gilead and Bashan
Jos  And as for the rest of the children of Manasseh their heritage was given to them by families for the children of Abiezer and for the children of Helek and for the children of Asriel and for the children of Shechem and for the children of Hepher and for the children of Shemida these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families
Jos  But Zelophehad the son of Hepher the son of Gilead the son of Machir the son of Manasseh had no sons but only daughters and these are the names of his daughters Mahlah and Noah Hoglah Milcah and Tirzah
Jos  And they came before Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and before the chiefs saying The Lord gave orders to Moses to give us a heritage among our brothers so in agreement with the orders of the Lord he gave them a heritage among their fathers brothers
Jos  And ten parts were given to Manasseh in addition to the land of Gilead and Bashan which is on the other side of Jordan
Jos  Because the daughters of Manasseh had a heritage among his sons and the land of Gilead was the property of the other sons of Manasseh
Jos  And the limit of Manassehs land was from Asher to Michmethath which is before Shechem the line goes on to the right hand to the people of Entappuah
Jos  The land of Tappuah was the property of Manasseh but Tappuah on the edge of Manasseh was the property of the children of Ephraim
Jos  And the limit goes down to the stream Kanah to the south of the stream these towns were Ephraims among the towns of Manasseh Manassehs limit was on the north side of the stream ending at the sea
Jos  To the south it is Ephraims and to the north it is Manassehs and the sea is his limit and they are touching Asher on the north and Issachar on the east
Jos  In Issachar and Asher Manasseh had Bethshean and its daughtertowns and Ibleam and its daughtertowns and the people of Dor and its daughtertowns and the people of Endor and its daughtertowns and the people of Taanach and its daughtertowns and the people of Megiddo and its daughtertowns that is the three hills
Jos  But the children of Manasseh were not able to make the people of those towns go out but the Canaanites would go on living in that land
Jos  And when the children of Israel had become strong they put the Canaanites to forced work in place of driving them out
Jos  Then the children of Joseph said to Joshua Why have you given me only one part and one stretch of land for my heritage For through the blessing given to me by the Lord up to now I am a great people
Jos  Then Joshua said to them If you are such a great people go up into the woodlands clearing a place there for yourselves in the land of the Perizzites and the Rephaim if the hillcountry of Ephraim is not wide enough for you
Jos  And the children of Joseph said The hillcountry is not enough for us and all the Canaanites living in the valley have iron warcarriages those in Bethshean and its towns as well as those in the valley of Jezreel
Jos  Then Joshua said to the children of Joseph to Ephraim and Manasseh You are a great people and have great power you are not to have one property only
Jos  For the hillcountry of Gilead will be yours  the woodland and cut down  its outskirts will be yours  get the Canaanites out for they have iron warcarriages  strong
Jos  And all the meeting of the children of Israel came together at Shiloh and put up the Tent of meeting there and the land was crushed before them
Jos  But there were still seven tribes among the children of Israel who had not taken up their heritage
Jos  Then Joshua said to the children of Israel Why are you so slow to go in and take up your heritage in the land which the Lord the God of your fathers has given you
Jos  Take from among you three men from every tribe and I will send them to go through the land and make a record of it for distribution as their heritage then let them come back to me
Jos  And let them make division of it into seven parts let Judah keep inside his limit on the south and let the children of Joseph keep inside their limit on the north
Jos  And you are to have the land marked out in seven parts and come back to me with the record and I will make the distribution for you here by the decision of the Lord our God
Jos  For the Levites have no part among you to be the Lords priests is their heritage and Gad and Reuben and the halftribe of Manasseh have had their heritage on the east side of Jordan given to them by Moses the servant of the Lord
Jos  So the men got up and went and Joshua gave orders to those who went to make a record of the land saying Go up and down through the land and make a record of it and come back here to me and I will make the distribution for you here by the decision of the Lord in Shiloh
Jos  So the men went travelling through the land and made a record of it by towns in seven parts in a book and came back to Joshua to the tentcircle at Shiloh
Jos  And Joshua made the distribution for them in Shiloh by the decision of the Lord marking out the land for the children of Israel by their divisions

Jos  This is the heritage of the tribe of the children of Dan by their families these towns with their unwalled places
Jos  So the distribution of the land and its limits was complete and the children of Israel gave Joshua the son of Nun a heritage among them
Jos  By the orders of the Lord they gave him the town for which he made request Timnathserah in the hillcountry of Ephraim there after building the town he made his livingplace
Jos  These are the heritages which Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of families of the tribes of the children of Israel gave out at Shiloh by the decision of the Lord at the door of the Tent of meeting So the distribution of the land was complete
Jos  And the Lord said to Joshua
Jos  Say to the children of Israel Let certain towns be marked out as safe places as I said to you by the mouth of Moses
Jos  So that any man who in error and without design has taken the life of another may go in flight to them and they will be safe places for you from him who has the right of punishment for blood
Jos  And if anyone goes in flight to one of those towns and comes into the public place of the town and puts his cause before the responsible men of the town they will take him into the town and give him a place among them where he may be safe
Jos  And if the one who has the right of punishment comes after him they are not to give the taker of life up to him because he was the cause of his neighbours death without designing it and not in hate
Jos  And he is to go on living in that town till he has to come before the meeting of the people to be judged till the death of him who is high priest at that time then the taker of life may come back to his town and to his house to the town from which he had gone in flight
Jos  So they made selection of Kedesh in Galilee in the hillcountry of Naphtali and Shechem in the hillcountry of Ephraim and Kiriatharba which is Hebron in the hillcountry of Judah
Jos  And on the east side of Jordan at Jericho they made selection of Bezer in the waste land in the tableland out of the tribe of Reuben and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh
Jos  These were the towns marked out for all the children of Israel and for the man from a strange country living among them so that anyone causing the death of another in error might go in flight there and not be put to death by him who has the right of punishment for blood till he had come before the meeting of the people
Jos  Then the heads of the families of the Levites came to Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and to the heads of families of the tribes of the children of Israel
Jos  And said to them in Shiloh in the land of Canaan The Lord gave orders by Moses that we were to have towns for living in with their grasslands for our cattle
Jos  And the children of Israel out of their heritage gave to the Levites these towns with their grasslands by the order of the Lord
Jos  And the heritage came out for the families of the Kohathites the children of Aaron the priest who were of the Levites were given thirteen towns from the tribes of Judah Simeon and Benjamin

Jos  All these towns with their grasslands the children of Israel gave by the decision of the Lord to the Levites as the Lord had given orders by Moses
Jos  From the tribes of the children of Judah and the children of Simeon they gave these towns listed here by name
Jos  These were for the children of Aaron among the families of the Kohathites of the children of Levi for they came first in the distribution
Jos  They gave them Kiriatharba the town of Arba the father of Anak which is Hebron in the hillcountry of Judah with its grasslands

Jos  All these towns were given to the children of Merari by their families that is the rest of the families of the Levites and their heritage was twelve towns
Jos  All the towns of the Levites among the heritage of the children of Israel were fortyeight towns with their grasslands
Jos  Every one of these towns had grasslands round it
Jos  So the Lord gave to Israel all the land which he gave by oath to their fathers so it became their heritage and their livingplace
Jos  And the Lord gave them peace on every side as he had said to their fathers all those who were against them gave way before them for the Lord gave them all up into their hands
Jos  The Lord kept faith with the house of Israel about all the good which he said he would do for them and all his words came true
Jos  Then Joshua sent for the Reubenites and the Gadites and the halftribe of Manasseh
Jos  And said to them You have kept all the orders of Moses the Lords servant and have done everything I gave you orders to do
Jos  You have now been with your brothers for a long time till this day you have been doing the orders of the Lord your God
Jos  And now the Lord your God has given your brothers rest as he said so now you may go back to your tents to the land of your heritage which Moses the Lords servant gave to you on the other side of Jordan
Jos  Only take great care to do the orders and the law which Moses the Lords servant gave you to have love for the Lord your God and to go in all his ways and to keep his laws and to be true to him and to be his servants with all your heart and with all your soul
Jos  Then Joshua gave them his blessing and sent them away and they went back to their tents
Jos  Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given a heritage in Bashan but to the other half Joshua gave a heritage among their brothers on the west side of Jordan Now when Joshua sent them away to their tents he gave them his blessing
Jos  And said to them Go back with much wealth to your tents and with very much cattle with silver and gold and brass and iron and with a very great store of clothing give your brothers a part of the goods taken in the war
Jos  So Reuben and Gad and the halftribe of Manasseh went back parting from the children of Israel at Shiloh in the land of Canaan to go to the land of Gilead to the land of their heritage which had been given to them by the Lords order to Moses
Jos  Now when they came to the country by Jordan in the land of Canaan the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the halftribe of Manasseh put up there by Jordan a great altar seen from far
Jos  And news came to the children of Israel See the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the halftribe of Manasseh have put up an altar opposite the land of Canaan in the country by Jordan on the side which is Israels
Jos  Then all the meeting of the children of Israel hearing this came together at Shiloh to go up against them to war
Jos  And the children of Israel sent Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest to the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the halftribe of Manasseh to the land of Gilead
Jos  And with him they sent ten chiefs one for every tribe of the children of Israel every one of them the head of his house among the families of Israel
Jos  And they came to the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the halftribe of Manasseh to the land of Gilead and said to them
Jos  This is what all the meeting of the people of the Lord has said What is this wrong which you have done against the God of Israel turning back this day from the Lord and building an altar for yourselves and being false to the Lord
Jos  Was not the sin of Baalpeor great enough from which we are not clear even to this day though punishment came on the people of the Lord
Jos  That now you are turned back from the Lord and because you are false to him today tomorrow his wrath will be let loose on all the people of Israel
Jos  But if the land you now have is unclean come over into the Lords land where his House is and take up your heritage among us but do not be false to the Lord and to us by building yourselves an altar in addition to the altar of the Lord our God
Jos  Did not Achan the son of Zerah do wrong about the cursed thing causing wrath to come on all the people of Israel And not on him only came the punishment of death
Jos  Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the halftribe of Manasseh said in answer to the heads of the families of Israel
Jos  God even God the Lord God even God the Lord he sees and Israel will seeif it is in pride or in sin against the Lord
Jos  That we have made ourselves an altar being false to the Lord keep us not safe from death this day and if for the purpose of offering burned offerings on it and meal offerings or peaceofferings let the Lord himself send punishment for it
Jos  And if we have not in fact done this designedly and with purpose having in our minds the fear that in time to come your children might say to our children What have you to do with the Lord the God of Israel
Jos  For the Lord has made Jordan a line of division between us and you the children of Reuben and the children of Gad you have no part in the Lord so your children will make our children give up fearing the Lord
Jos  So we said Let us now make an altar for ourselves not for burned offerings or for the offerings of beasts
Jos  But to be a witness between us and you and between the future generations that we have the right of worshipping the Lord with our burned offerings and our offerings of beasts and our peaceofferings so that your children will not be able to say to our children in time to come You have no part in the Lord
Jos  For we said to ourselves If they say this to us or to future generations then we will say See this copy of the Lords altar which our fathers made not for burned offerings or offerings of beasts but for a witness between us and you
Jos  Never let it be said that we were false to the Lord turning back this day from him and building an altar for burned offerings and meal offerings and offerings of beasts in addition to the altar of the Lord our God which is before his House
Jos  Then Phinehas the priest and the chiefs of the meeting and the heads of the families of Israel who were with him hearing what the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh said were pleased
Jos  And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh Now we are certain that the Lord is among us because you have not done this wrong against the Lord and you have kept us from falling into the hands of the Lord
Jos  Then Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest and the chiefs went back from the land of Gilead from the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and came to the children of Israel in Canaan and gave them the news
Jos  And the children of Israel were pleased about this and they gave praise to God and had no more thought of going to war against the children of Reuben and the children of Gad for the destruction of their land
Jos  And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad gave to that altar the name of Ed For they said It is a witness between us that the Lord is God
Jos  Now after a long time when the Lord had given Israel rest from wars on every side and Joshua was old and full of years
Jos  Joshua sent for all Israel for their responsible men and their chiefs and their judges and their overseers and said to them I am old and full of years
Jos  You have seen everything the Lord your God has done to all these nations because of you for it is the Lord your God who has been fighting for you
Jos  Now I have given to you as the heritage of your tribes all these nations which are still in the land together with those cut off by me from Jordan as far as the Great Sea on the west
Jos  The Lord your God will send them away by force driving them out before you and you are to take their land for your heritage as the Lord your God said to you
Jos  So be very strong to keep and do whatever is recorded in the book of the law of Moses not turning away from it to the right or to the left
Jos  Have nothing to do with these nations who still are living among you let not their gods be named by you or used in your oaths do not be their servants or give them worship
Jos  But be true to the Lord your God as you have been till this day
Jos  For the Lord has sent out from before you nations great and strong and they have all given way before you till this day
Jos  One man of you is able to put to flight a thousand for it is the Lord your God who is fighting for you as he has said to you
Jos  So keep watch on yourselves and see that you have love for the Lord your God
Jos  For if you go back joining yourselves to the rest of these nations who are still among you getting married to them and living with them and they with you
Jos  Then you may be certain that the Lord your God will not go on driving these nations out from before you but they will become a danger and a cause of sin to you a whip for your sides and thorns in your eyes till you are cut off from this good land which the Lord your God has given you
Jos  Now I am about to go the way of all the earth and you have seen and are certain all of you in your hearts and souls that in all the good things which the Lord said about you he has kept faith with you everything has come true for you
Jos  And you will see that as all the good things which the Lord your God undertook to do for you have come to you so the Lord will send down on you all the evil things till he has made your destruction complete and you are cut off from the good land which the Lord your God has given you
Jos  If the agreement of the Lord your God which was given to you by his orders is broken and you become the servants of other gods and give them worship then the wrath of the Lord will be burning against you and you will quickly be cut off from the good land which he has given you
Jos  Then Joshua got all the tribes of Israel together at Shechem and he sent for the responsible men of Israel and their chiefs and their judges and their overseers and they took their place before God
Jos  And Joshua said to all the people These are the words of the Lord the God of Israel In the past your fathers Terah the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor were living on the other side of the River and they were worshipping other gods
Jos  And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the River guiding him through all the land of Canaan I made his offspring great in number and gave him Isaac
Jos  And to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau to Esau I gave Mount Seir as his heritage but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt
Jos  And I sent Moses and Aaron troubling Egypt by all the signs I did among them and after that I took you out
Jos  I took your fathers out of Egypt and you came to the Red Sea and the Egyptians came after your fathers to the Red Sea with their warcarriages and their horsemen
Jos  And at their cry the Lord made it dark between you and the Egyptians and made the sea go over them covering them with its waters your eyes have seen what I did in Egypt then for a long time you were living in the waste land
Jos  And I took you into the lands of the Amorites on the other side of Jordan and they made war on you and I gave them into your hands and you took their land and I sent destruction on them before you
Jos  Then Balak the son of Zippor king of Moab went up to war against Israel and he sent for Balaam the son of Beor to put a curse on you
Jos  But I did not give ear to Balaam and so he went on blessing you and I kept you safe from him
Jos  Then you went over Jordan and came to Jericho and the men of Jericho made war on you the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Girgashites and the Hivites and the Jebusites and I gave them up into your hands
Jos  And I sent the hornet before you driving out the two kings of the Amorites before you not with your sword and your bow
Jos  And I gave you a land on which you had done no work and towns not of your building and you are now living in them and your food comes from vinegardens and olivegardens not of your planting
Jos  So now go in fear of the Lord and be his servants with true hearts put away the gods worshipped by your fathers across the River and in Egypt and be servants of the Lord
Jos  And if it seems evil to you to be the servants of the Lord make the decision this day whose servants you will be of the gods whose servants your fathers were across the River or of the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living but I and my house will be the servants of the Lord
Jos  Then the people in answer said Never will we give up the Lord to be the servants of other gods
Jos  For it is the Lord our God who has taken us and our fathers out of the land of Egypt out of the prisonhouse and who did all those great signs before our eyes and kept us safe on all our journeys and among all the peoples through whom we went
Jos  And the Lord sent out from before us all the peoples the Amorites living in the land so we will be the servants of the Lord for he is our God
Jos  And Joshua said to the people You are not able to be the servants of the Lord for he is a holy God a God who will not let his honour be given to another he will have no mercy on your wrongdoing or your sins
Jos  If you are turned away from the Lord and become the servants of strange gods then turning against you he will do you evil cutting you off after he has done you good
Jos  And the people said to Joshua No But we will be the servants of the Lord
Jos  And Joshua said to the people You are witnesses against yourselves that you have made the decision to be the servants of the Lord And they said We are witnesses
Jos  Then he said put away the strange gods among you turning your hearts to the Lord the God of Israel
Jos  And the people said to Joshua We will be the servants of the Lord our God and we will give ear to his voice
Jos  So Joshua made an agreement with the people that day and gave them a rule and a law in Shechem
Jos  And Joshua put these words on record writing them in the book of the law of God and he took a great stone and put it up there under the oaktree which was in the holy place of the Lord
Jos  And Joshua said to all the people See now this stone is to be a witness against us for all the words of the Lord have been said to us in its hearing so it will be a witness against you if you are false to the Lord your God
Jos  Then Joshua let the people go away every man to his heritage
Jos  Now after these things the death of Joshua the son of Nun the servant of the Lord took place he being then a hundred and ten years old
Jos  And they put his body in the earth in the land of his heritage in Timnathserah in the hillcountry of Ephraim to the north of Mount Gaash
Jos  And Israel was true to the Lord all the days of Joshua and all the days of the older men who were still living after Joshuas death and had seen what the Lord had done for Israel
Jos  And the bones of Joseph which the children of Israel had taken up from Egypt they put in the earth in Shechem in the property which Jacob had got from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred shekels and they became the heritage of the children of Joseph
Jos  Then the death of Eleazar the son of Aaron took place and his body was put in the earth in the hill of Phinehas his son which had been given to him in the hillcountry of Ephraim
Jug  Now after the death of Joshua the children of Israel made request to the Lord saying Who is to go up first to make war for us against the Canaanites
Jug  And the Lord said Judah is to go up see I have given the land into his hands
Jug  Then Judah said to Simeon his brother Come up with me into my heritage so that we may make war against the Canaanites and I will then go with you into your heritage So Simeon went with him
Jug  And Judah went up and the Lord gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hands and they overcame ten thousand of them in Bezek
Jug  And they came across Adonizedek and made war on him and they overcame the Canaanites and the Perizzites
Jug  But Adonizedek went in flight and they went after him and overtook him and had his thumbs and his great toes cut off
Jug  And Adonizedek said Seventy kings whose thumbs and great toes had been cut off got broken meat under my table as I have done so has God done to me in full And they took him to Jerusalem and he came to his end there
Jug  Then the children of Judah made an attack on Jerusalem and took it burning down the town after they had put its people to the sword without mercy
Jug  After that the children of Judah went down to make war on the Canaanites living in the hillcountry and in the south and in the lowlands
Jug  And Caleb went against the Canaanites of Hebron now in earlier times Hebron was named Kiriatharba and he put Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai to the sword
Jug  And from there he went up against the people of Debir Now the name of Debir in earlier times was Kiriathsepher
Jug  And Caleb said I will give Achsah my daughter as wife to the man who overcomes Kiriathsepher and takes it
Jug  And Othniel the son of Kenaz Calebs younger brother took it so he gave him his daughter Achsah for his wife
Jug  Now when she came to him he put into her mind the idea of requesting a field from her father and she got down from her ass and Caleb said to her What is it
Jug  And she said to him Give me a blessing because you have put me in a dry southland now give me springs of water So Caleb gave her the higher spring and the lower spring
Jug  Now Hobab the Kenite Moses fatherinlaw had come up out of the town of palmtrees with the children of Judah into the waste land of Arad and he went and was living among the Amalekites
Jug  And Judah went with Simeon his brother and overcame the Canaanites living in Zephath and put it under the curse and he gave the town the name of Hormah
Jug  Then Judah took Gaza and its limit and Ashkelon and its limit and Ekron and its limit
Jug  And the Lord was with Judah and he took the hillcountry for his heritage but he was unable to make the people of the valley go out for they had warcarriages of iron
Jug  And they gave Hebron to Caleb as Moses had said and he took the land of the three sons of Anak driving them out from there
Jug  And the children of Judah did not make the Jebusites who were living in Jerusalem go out the Jebusites are still living with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem
Jug  And the family of Joseph went up against Bethel and the Lord was with them
Jug  So they sent men to make a search round Bethel Now the name of the town in earlier times was Luz
Jug  And the watchers saw a man coming out of the town and said to him If you will make clear to us the way into the town we will be kind to you
Jug  So he made clear to them the way into the town and they put it to the sword but they let the man and all his family get away safe
Jug  And he went into the land of the Hittites building a town there and naming it Luz which is its name to this day
Jug  And Manasseh did not take away the land of the people of Bethshean and its daughtertowns or of Taanach and its daughtertowns or of the people of Dor and its daughtertowns or of the people of Ibleam and its daughtertowns or of the people of Megiddo and its daughtertowns driving them out but the Canaanites would go on living in that land
Jug  And whenever Israel became strong they put the Canaanites to forced work without driving them out completely
Jug  And Ephraim did not make the Canaanites who were living in Gezer go out but the Canaanites went on living in Gezer among them
Jug  Zebulun did not make the people of Kitron or the people of Nahalol go out but the Canaanites went on living among them and were put to forced work
Jug  And Asher did not take the land of the people of Acco or Zidon or Ahlab or Achzib or Helbah or Aphik or Rehob driving them out
Jug  But the Asherites went on living among the Canaanites the people of the land without driving them out
Jug  Naphtali did not take the land of the people of Bethshemesh or of Bethanath driving them out but he was living among the Canaanites in the land however the people of Bethshemesh and Bethanath were put to forced work
Jug  And the children of Dan were forced into the hillcountry by the Amorites who would not let them come down into the valley
Jug  For the Amorites would go on living in Mount Heres in Aijalon and in Shaalbim but the children of Joseph became stronger than they and put them to forced work
Jug  And the limit of the Edomites went from the slope of Akrabbim from Sela and up
Jug  Now the angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim And he said  I took you out of Egypt guiding you into the land which I gave by an oath to your fathers and I said My agreement with you will never be broken by me
Jug  And you are to make no agreement with the people of this land you are to see that their altars are broken down but you have not given ear to my voice what have you done
Jug  And so I have said I will not send them out from before you but they will be a danger to you and their gods will be a cause of falling to you
Jug  Now on hearing these words which the angel of the Lord said to all the children of Israel the people gave themselves up to loud crying and weeping
Jug  And they gave that place the name of Bochim and made offerings there to the Lord
Jug  And Joshua let the people go away and the children of Israel went every man to his heritage to take the land for themselves
Jug  And the people were true to the Lord all the days of Joshua and all the days of the responsible men who were still living after the death of Joshua and had seen all the great work of the Lord which he had done for Israel
Jug  And death came to Joshua the son of Nun the servant of the Lord he being a hundred and ten years old
Jug  And they put his body in the earth in the land of his heritage in Timnathheres in the hillcountry of Ephraim to the north of Mount Gaash
Jug  And in time death overtook all that generation and another generation came after them having no knowledge of the Lord or of the things which he had done for Israel
Jug  And the children of Israel did evil in the eyes of the Lord and became servants to the Baals
Jug  And they gave up the Lord the God of their fathers who had taken them out of the land of Egypt and went after other gods the gods of the peoples round about them worshipping them and moving the Lord to wrath
Jug  And they gave up the Lord and became the servants of Baal and the Astartes
Jug  And the wrath of the Lord was burning against Israel and he gave them up into the hands of those who violently took their property and into the hands of their haters all round them so that they were forced to give way before them
Jug  Wherever they went out the hand of the Lord was against them for evil as the Lord had taken his oath it would be and things became very hard for them
Jug  Then the Lord gave them judges as their saviours from the hands of those who were cruel to them
Jug  But still they would not give ear to their judges but went after other gods and gave them worship quickly turning from the way in which their fathers had gone keeping the orders of the Lord but they did not do so
Jug  And whenever the Lord gave them judges then the Lord was with the judge and was their saviour from the hands of their haters all the days of the judge for the Lord was moved by their cries of grief because of those who were cruel to them
Jug  But whenever the judge was dead they went back and did more evil than their fathers going after other gods to be their servants and their worshippers giving up nothing of their sins and their hardhearted ways
Jug  And the wrath of the Lord was burning against Israel and he said Because this nation has not been true to my agreement which I made with their fathers and has not given ear to my voice
Jug  From now on I will not go on driving out from before them any of the nations which at the death of Joshua were still living in this land
Jug  In order to put Israel to the test and see if they will keep the way of the Lord walking in it as their fathers did or not
Jug  So the Lord let those nations go on living in the land not driving them out quickly and did not give them up into the hands of Joshua
Jug  Now these are the nations which the Lord kept in the land for the purpose of testing Israel by them all those who had had no experience of all the wars of Canaan
Jug  Only because of the generations of the children of Israel for the purpose of teaching them waronly those who up till then had no experience of it
Jug  The five chiefs of the Philistines and all the Canaanites and the Zidonians and the Hivites living in Mount Lebanon from the mountain Baalhermon as far as Hamath
Jug  For the purpose of testing Israel by them to see if they would give ear to the orders of the Lord which he had given to their fathers by the hand of Moses
Jug  Now the children of Israel were living among the Canaanites the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites
Jug  And they took as wives the daughters of these nations and gave their daughters to their sons and became servants to their gods
Jug  And the children of Israel did evil in the eyes of the Lord and put out of their minds the Lord their God and became servants to the Baals and the Astartes
Jug  So the wrath of the Lord was burning against Israel and he gave them up into the hands of Cushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia and the children of Israel were his servants for eight years
Jug  And when the children of Israel made prayer to the Lord he gave them a saviour Othniel the son of Kenaz Calebs younger brother
Jug  And the spirit of the Lord came on him and he became judge of Israel and went out to war and the Lord gave up Cushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hands and he overcame him
Jug  Then for forty years the land had peace till the death of Othniel the son of Kenaz
Jug  Then the children of Israel again did evil in the eyes of the Lord and the Lord made Eglon king of Moab strong against Israel because they had done evil in the Lords eyes
Jug  And Eglon got together the people of Ammon and Amalek and they went and overcame Israel and took the town of palmtrees
Jug  And the children of Israel were servants to Eglon king of Moab for eighteen years
Jug  Then when the children of Israel made prayer to the Lord he gave them a saviour Ehud the son of Gera the Benjamite a lefthanded man and the children of Israel sent an offering by him to Eglon king of Moab
Jug  So Ehud made himself a twoedged sword a cubit long which he put on at his right side under his robe
Jug  And he took the offering to Eglon king of Moab who was a very fat man
Jug  And after giving the offering he sent away the people who had come with the offering
Jug  But he himself turning back from the stone images at Gilgal said I have something to say to you in secret O king And he said Let there be quiet Then all those who were waiting before him went out
Jug  Then Ehud came in to him while he was seated by himself in his summerhouse And Ehud said I have a word from God for you And he got up from his seat
Jug  And Ehud put out his left hand and took the sword from his right side and sent it into his stomach
Jug  And the handpart went in after the blade and the fat was joined up over the blade for he did not take the sword out of his stomach And he went out into the 
Jug  Then Ehud went out into the covered way shutting the doors of the summerhouse on him and locking them
Jug  Now when he had gone the kings servants came and saw that the doors of the summerhouse were locked and they said It may be that he is in his summerhouse for a private purpose
Jug  And they went on waiting till they were shamed but the doors were still shut so they took the key and opening them saw their lord stretched out dead on the floor
Jug  But Ehud had got away while they were waiting and had gone past the stone images and got away to Seirah
Jug  And when he came there he had a horn sounded in the hillcountry of Ephraim and all the children of Israel went down with him from the hillcountry and he at their head
Jug  And he said to them Come after me for the Lord has given the Moabites your haters into your hands So they went down after him and took the crossingplaces of Jordan against Moab and let no one go across
Jug  At that time they put about ten thousand men of Moab to the sword every strong man and every man of war not a man got away
Jug  So Moab was broken that day under the hand of Israel And for eighty years the land had peace
Jug  And after him came Shamgar the son of Anath who put to death six hundred Philistines with an oxstick and he was another saviour of Israel
Jug  And the children of Israel again did evil in the eyes of the Lord when Ehud was dead
Jug  And the Lord gave them up into the hands of Jabin king of Canaan who was ruling in Hazor the captain of his army was Sisera who was living in Harosheth of the Gentiles
Jug  Then the children of Israel made prayer to the Lord for he had nine hundred iron warcarriages and for twenty years he was very cruel to the children of Israel
Jug  Now Deborah a woman prophet the wife of Lapidoth was judge of Israel at that time
Jug  And she had her seat under the palmtree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hillcountry of Ephraim and the children of Israel came up to her to be judged
Jug  And she sent for Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedeshnaphtali and said to him Has not the Lord the God of Israel given orders saying Go and get your force into line in Mount Tabor and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun
Jug  And I will make Sisera the captain of Jabins army with his warcarriages and his forces come against you at the river Kishon where I will give him into your hands
Jug  And Barak said to her If you will go with me then I will go but if you will not go with me I will not go
Jug  And she said I will certainly go with you though you will get no honour in your undertaking for the Lord will give Sisera into the hands of a woman So Deborah got up and went with Barak to Kedesh
Jug  Then Barak sent for Zebulun and Naphtali to come to Kedesh and ten thousand men went up after him and Deborah went up with him
Jug  Now Heber the Kenite separating himself from the rest of the Kenites from the children of Hobab the brotherinlaw of Moses had put up his tent as far away as the oaktree in Zaanannim by Kedesh
Jug  And word was given to Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor
Jug  So Sisera got together all his warcarriages nine hundred warcarriages of iron and all the people who were with him from Harosheth of the Gentiles as far as the river Kishon
Jug  Then Deborah said to Barak Up for today the Lord has given Sisera into your hands has not the Lord gone out before you So Barak went down from Mount Tabor and ten thousand men after him
Jug  And the Lord sent fear on Sisera and all his warcarriages and all his army before Barak and Sisera got down from his warcarriage and went in flight on foot
Jug  But Barak went after the warcarriages and the army as far as Harosheth of the Gentiles and all Siseras army was put to the sword not a man got away
Jug  But Sisera went in flight on foot to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite for there was peace between Jabin king of Hazor and the family of Heber the Kenite
Jug  And Jael went out to Sisera and said to him Come in my lord come in to me without fear So he went into her tent and she put a cover over him
Jug  Then he said to her Give me now a little water for I have need of a drink And opening a skin of milk she gave him drink and put the cover over him again
Jug  And he said to her Take your place at the door of the tent and if anyone comes and says to you Is there any man here say No
Jug  Then Jael Hebers wife took a tentpin and a hammer and went up to him quietly driving the pin into his head and it went through his head into the earth for he was in a deep sleep from weariness and so he came to his end
Jug  Then Jael went out and meeting Barak going after Sisera said to him Come and I will let you see the man you are searching for So he came into her tent and saw and there was Sisera stretched out dead with the tentpin in his head
Jug  So that day God overcame Jabin king of Canaan before the children of Israel
Jug  And the power of the children of Israel went on increasing against Jabin king of Canaan till he was cut off
Jug  At that time Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam made this song saying
Jug  Because of the flowing hair of the fighters in Israel because the people gave themselves freely give praise to the Lord
Jug  Give attention O kings give ear O rulers I even I will make a song to the Lord I will make melody to the Lord the God of Israel
Jug  Lord when you went out from Seir moving like an army from the field of Edom the earth was shaking and the heavens were troubled and the clouds were dropping water
Jug  The mountains were shaking before the Lord before the Lord the God of Israel
Jug  In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath in the days of Jael the highways were not used and travellers went by side roads
Jug  Country towns were no more in Israel  were no more till you Deborah came up till you came up as a mother in Israel
Jug  They had no one to make arms there were no more armed men in the towns was there a bodycover or a spear to be seen among forty thousand in Israel
Jug  Come you rulers of Israel you who gave yourselves freely among the people give praise to the Lord
Jug  Let them give thought to it who go on white asses and those who are walking on the road
Jug  Give ear to the women laughing by the watersprings there they will give again the story of the upright acts of the Lord all the upright acts of his arm in Israel
Jug  Awake awake Deborah awake awake give a song Up Barak and take prisoner those who took you prisoner O son of Abinoam
Jug  Then the chiefs went down to the doors the Lords people went down among the strong ones
Jug  Out of Ephraim they came down into the valley after you Benjamin among your tribesmen from Machir came down the captains and from Zebulun those in whose hand is the rulers rod
Jug  Your chiefs Issachar were with Deborah and Naphtali was true to Barak into the valley they went rushing out at his feet In Reuben there were divisions and great searchings of heart
Jug  Why did you keep quiet among the sheep hearing nothing but the watchers piping to the flocks
Jug  Gilead was living over Jordan and Dan was waiting in his ships Asher kept in his place by the seas edge living by his inlets
Jug  It was the people of Zebulun who put their lives in danger even to death with Naphtali on the high places of the field
Jug  The kings came on to the fight the kings of Canaan were warring in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo they took no profit in money
Jug  The stars from heaven were fighting from their highways they were fighting against Sisera
Jug  The river Kishon took them violently away stopping their flight the river Kishon Give praise O my soul to the strength of the Lord
Jug  Then loudly the feet of the horses were sounding with the stamping the stamping of their warhorses
Jug  A curse a curse on Meroz said the angel of the Lord A bitter curse on her townspeople Because they came not to the help of the Lord to the help of the Lord among the strong ones
Jug  Blessings be on Jael more than on all women Blessings greater than on any in the tents
Jug  His request was for water she gave him milk she put butter before him on a fair plate
Jug  She put out her hand to the tentpin and her right hand to the workmans hammer and she gave Sisera a blow crushing his head wounding and driving through his brow
Jug  Bent at her feet he went down he was stretched out bent at her feet he went down where he was bent down there he went down in death
Jug  Looking out from the window she gave a cry the mother of Sisera was crying out through the window Why is his carriage so long in coming When will the noise of his wheels be sounding
Jug  Her wise women gave answer to her yes she made answer again to herself
Jug  Are they not getting are they not parting the goods among them a young girl or two to every man and to Sisera robes of coloured needlework worked in fair colours on this side and on that for the neck of the queen
Jug  So may destruction come on all your haters O Lord but let your lovers be like the sun going out in his strength And for forty years the land had peace
Jug  And the children of Israel did evil in the eyes of the Lord and the Lord gave them up into the hand of Midian for seven years
Jug  And Midian was stronger than Israel and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made holes for themselves in the mountains and hollows in the rocks and strong places
Jug  And whenever Israels grain was planted the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the east came up against them
Jug  And put their army in position against them and they took all the produce of the earth as far as Gaza till there was no food in Israel or any sheep or oxen or asses
Jug  For they came up regularly with their oxen and their tents they came like the locusts in number they and their camels were without number and they came into the land for its destruction
Jug  And Israel was in great need because of Midian and the cry of the children of Israel went up to the Lord
Jug  And when the cry of the children of Israel because of Midian came before the Lord
Jug  The Lord sent a prophet to the children of Israel who said to them The Lord the God of Israel has said I took you up from Egypt out of the prisonhouse
Jug  And I took you out of the hands of the Egyptians and out of the hands of all who were cruel to you and I sent them out by force from before you and gave you their land
Jug  And I said to you I am the Lord your God you are not to give worship to the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living but you did not give ear to my voice
Jug  Now the angel of the Lord came and took his seat under the oaktree in Ophrah in the field of Joash the Abiezrite and his son Gideon was crushing grain in the place where the grapes were crushed so that the Midianites might not see it
Jug  And the angel of the Lord came before his eyes and said to him The Lord is with you O man of war
Jug  Then Gideon said to him O my lord if the Lord is with us why has all this come on us And where are all his works of power of which our fathers have given us word saying Did not the Lord take us out of Egypt But now he has given us up handing us over to the power of Midian
Jug  And the Lord turning to him said Go in the strength you have and be Israels saviour from Midian have I not sent you
Jug  And he said to him O Lord how may I be the saviour of Israel See my family is the poorest in Manasseh and I am the least in my fathers house
Jug  Then the Lord said to him Truly I will be with you and you will overcome the Midianites as if they were one man
Jug  So he said to him If now I have grace in your eyes then give me a sign that it is you who are talking to me
Jug  Do not go away till I come with my offering and put it before you And he said I will not go away before you come back
Jug  Then Gideon went in and made ready a young goat and with an ephah of meal he made unleavened cakes he put the meat in a basket and the soup in which it had been cooked he put in a pot and he took it out to him under the oaktree and gave it to him there
Jug  And the angel of God said to him Take the meat and the unleavened cakes and put them down on the rock over there draining out the soup over them And he did so
Jug  Then the angel of the Lord put out the stick which was in his hand touching the meat and the cakes with the end of it and a flame came up out of the rock burning up the meat and the cakes and the angel of the Lord was seen no longer
Jug  Then Gideon was certain that he was the angel of the Lord and Gideon said I am in fear O Lord God for I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face
Jug  But the Lord said to him Peace be with you have no fear you are in no danger of death
Jug  Then Gideon made an altar there to the Lord and gave it the name Yahwehshalom to this day it is in Ophrah of the Abiezrites
Jug  The same night the Lord said to him Take ten men of your servants and an ox seven years old and after pulling down the altar of Baal which is your fathers and cutting down the holy tree by its side
Jug  Make an altar to the Lord your God on the top of this rock in the ordered way and take the ox and make a burned offering with the wood of the holy tree which has been cut down
Jug  Then Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the Lord had said to him but fearing to do it by day because of his fathers people and the men of the town he did it by night
Jug  And the men of the town got up early in the morning and they saw the altar of Baal broken down and the holy tree which was by it cut down and the ox offered on the altar which had been put up there
Jug  And they said to one another Who has done this thing And after searching with care they said Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing
Jug  Then the men of the town said to Joash Make your son come out to be put to death for pulling down the altar of Baal and cutting down the holy tree which was by it
Jug  But Joash said to all those who were attacking him Will you take up the cause of Baal will you be his saviour Let anyone who will take up his cause be put to death while it is still morning if he is a god let him take up his cause himself because of the pulling down of his altar
Jug  So that day he gave him the name of Jerubbaal saying Let Baal take up his cause against him because his altar has been broken down
Jug  Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the east banding themselves together went over and put up their tents in the valley of Jezreel
Jug  But the spirit of the Lord came on Gideon and at the sound of his horn all Abiezer came together after him
Jug  And he sent through all Manasseh and they came after him and he sent to Asher and Zebulun and Naphtali and they came up and were joined to the others
Jug  Then Gideon said to God If you are going to give Israel salvation by my hand as you have said
Jug  See I will put the wool of a sheep on the grainfloor if there is dew on the wool only while all the earth is dry then I will be certain that it is your purpose to give Israel salvation by my hand as you have said
Jug  And it was so for he got up early on the morning after and twisting the wool in his hands he got a basin full of water from the dew on the wool
Jug  Then Gideon said to God Do not be moved to wrath against me if I say only this let me make one more test with the wool let the wool now be dry while the earth is covered with dew
Jug  And that night God did so for the wool was dry and there was dew on all the earth round it
Jug  Then Jerubbaal that is Gideon and all the people with him got up early and put up their tents by the side of the waterspring of Harod the tents of Midian were on the north side of him under the hill of Moreh in the valley
Jug  And the Lord said to Gideon So great is the number of your people that if I give the Midianites into their hands they will be uplifted in pride over me and will say I myself have been my saviour
Jug  So now let it be given out to the people that anyone who is shaking with fear is to go back from Mount Galud So twentytwo thousand of the people went back but there were still ten thousand
Jug  Then the Lord said to Gideon There are still more people than is necessary take them down to the water so that I may put them to the test for you there then whoever I say is to go with you will go and whoever I say is not to go will not go
Jug  So he took the people down to the water and the Lord said to Gideon Put on one side by themselves all those drinking up the water with their tongues like a dog and in the same way all those who go down on their knees to the water while drinking
Jug  Now the number of those who took up the water with their tongues was three hundred all the rest of the people went down on their knees to the water
Jug  And the Lord said to Gideon By those three hundred who were drinking with their tongues I will give you salvation and give the Midianites into your hands let the rest of the people go away every man to his place
Jug  So they took the vessels of the people and their horns from their hands and he sent them away every man to his tent keeping only the three hundred and the tents of Midian were lower down in the valley
Jug  The same night the Lord said to him Up go down now against their army for I have given them into your hands
Jug  But if you have fear of going down take your servant Purah with you and go down to the tents
Jug  And after hearing what they are saying you will get strength to go down against the army So he went down with his servant Purah to the outer line of the tents of the armed men
Jug  Now the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the people of the east were covering the valley like locusts and their camels were like the sand by the seaside without number
Jug  When Gideon came there a man was giving his friend an account of his dream saying See I had a dream about a cake of barley bread which falling into the tents of Midian came on to the tent overturning it so that it was stretched out flat on the earth
Jug  And his friend in answer said This is certainly the sword of Gideon the son of Joash the men of Israel into their hands God has given up all the army of Midian
Jug  Then Gideon hearing the story of the dream and the sense in which they took it gave worship then he went back to the tents of Israel and said Up for the Lord has given the army of Midian into your hands
Jug  Then separating the three hundred men into three bands he gave every man a horn and a vessel in which was a flaming branch
Jug  And he said to them Keep your eyes on me and do what I do when I come to the outer line of tents whatever I do you are to do the same
Jug  At the sound of my horn and the horns of those who are with me let your horns be sounded all round the tents and say For the Lord and for Gideon
Jug  So Gideon and the three hundred men who were with him came to the outer line of tents at the start of the middle watch when the watchmen had only then taken their stations and the horns were sounded and the vessels broken
Jug  So the three bands all gave a loud note on their horns and when the vessels had been broken they took the flaming branches in their left hands and the horns in their right hands ready for blowing crying out For the Lord and for Gideon
Jug  Then they made a line round the tents every man in his place and all the army awaking from sleep came running out and with loud cries went in flight
Jug  And the three hundred gave a loud note on their horns and every mans sword was turned by the Lord against his brother all through the army and the army went in flight as far as Bethshittah in the direction of Zeredah to the edge of Abelmeholah by Tabbath
Jug  And the men of Israel came together from Naphtali and from Asher and all Manasseh and went after Midian
Jug  Then Gideon sent through all the hillcountry of Ephraim saying Come down against Midian and keep the ways across Jordan before they come So all the men of Ephraim massing themselves together kept the ways across Jordan
Jug  And they took the two chiefs of Midian Oreb and Zeeb and they put Oreb to death at the rock of Oreb and Zeeb they put to death at the place of the grapecrushing in Zeeb and they went after Midian but the heads of Oreb and Zeeb they took across Jordan to Gideon
Jug  And the men of Ephraim came and said to him Why did you not send for us when you went to war against Midian And they said sharp and angry words to him
Jug  And he said to them What have I done in comparison with you Is not that which Ephraim took up after the grapecutting better than all the grapes which Abiezer got in from the grapecutting
Jug  God has given into your hands the chiefs of Midian Oreb and Zeeb what have I been able to do in comparison with you And when he said this their feeling about him became kinder
Jug  Then Gideon came to Jordan and went over it with his three hundred overcome with weariness and in need of food
Jug  And he said to the men of Succoth Give bread cakes to my people for they are overcome with weariness and I am going on after Zebah and Zalmunna the kings of Midian
Jug  But the chiefs of Succoth said Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna even now in your hand that we are to give bread to your army
Jug  Then Gideon said Because of this when the Lord has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hands I will have you stretched on a bed of thorns of the waste land and on sharp stems and have you crushed as grain is crushed on a grainfloor
Jug  So he went up from there to Penuel and made the same request to the men of Penuel but they gave him the same answer as the men of Succoth had given
Jug  So he said to the men of Penuel When I come back in peace I will have this tower broken down
Jug  Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor and their armies with them about fifteen thousand men those of all the army of the children of the east who were still living for a hundred and twenty thousand of their swordsmen had been put to death
Jug  And Gideon went up by the way used by the people living in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah and made an attack on the army when they had no thought of danger
Jug  And Zebah and Zalmunna went in flight and he went after them and took the two kings of Midian Zebah and Zalmunna and put all the army to the curse
Jug  Then Gideon the son of Joash went back from the fight
Jug  And taking prisoner a young man of the people of Succoth he got from him in answer to his questions a list of the chiefs of Succoth and the responsible men seventyseven men
Jug  So he came to the men of Succoth and said Here are Zebah and Zalmunna on account of whom you made sport of me saying Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna even now in your hand that we are to give bread to your army who are overcome with weariness
Jug  Then he took the responsible men of the town and had them crushed on a bed of thorns and sharp stems
Jug  And he had the tower of Penuel broken down and the men of the town put to death
Jug  Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna Where are the men whom you put to death at Tabor And they gave answer As you are so were they every one of them was like a kings son
Jug  And he said They were my brothers my mothers sons by the life of the Lord if you had kept them safe I would not put you to death
Jug  Then he said to Jether his oldest son Up Put them to death But the boy did not take out his sword fearing because he was still a boy
Jug  Then Zebah and Zalmunna said Up Put an end to us yourself for you have a mans strength Then Gideon got up and put Zebah and Zalmunna to death and took the ornaments which were on their camels necks
Jug  Then the men of Israel said to Gideon Be our ruler you and your son and your sons son after him for you have been our saviour from the hands of Midian
Jug  But Gideon said to them I will not be a ruler over you and my son will not be a ruler over you it is the Lord who will be ruler over you
Jug  Then Gideon said to them I have a request to make to you let every man give me the earrings he has taken For they had gold earrings because they were Ishmaelites
Jug  And they gave answer We will gladly give them So they put down a robe every man dropping into it the earrings he had taken
Jug  The weight of the gold earrings which he got from them was one thousand seven hundred shekels of gold in addition to the moonornaments and jewels and the purple robes which were on the kings of Midian and the chains on their camels necks
Jug  And Gideon made an ephod from them and put it up in his town Ophrah and all Israel went after it there and were false to the Lord and it became a cause of sin to Gideon and his house
Jug  So Midian was broken before the children of Israel and the Midianites never got back their strength And the land had peace for forty years in the days of Gideon
Jug  And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went back to his house and was living there
Jug  Gideon had seventy sons the offspring of his body for he had a number of wives
Jug  And the servantwife he had in Shechem had a son by him to whom he gave the name Abimelech
Jug  And Gideon the son of Joash came to his end when he was very old and his body was put in the restingplace of Joash his father in Ophrah of the Abiezrites
Jug  And after the death of Gideon the children of Israel again went after the gods of Canaan and were false to the Lord and made Baalberith their god
Jug  And the children of Israel did not keep in their minds the Lord their God who had been their saviour from all their haters on every side
Jug  And they were not kind to the house of Jerubbaal that is Gideon in reward for all the good he had done to Israel
Jug  Now Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mothers family and said to them and to all the family of his mothers father
Jug  Say now in the ears of all the townsmen of Shechem Is it better for you to be ruled by all the seventy sons of Jerubbaal or by one man only And keep in mind that I am your bone and your flesh
Jug  So his mothers family said all this about him in the ears of all the townsmen of Shechem and their hearts were turned to Abimelech for they said He is our brother
Jug  And they gave him seventy shekels of silver from the house of Baalberith with which Abimelech got the support of a number of uncontrolled and goodfornothing persons
Jug  Then he went to his fathers house at Ophrah and put his brothers the seventy sons of Jerubbaal to death on the same stone however Jotham the youngest kept himself safe by going away to a secret place
Jug  And all the townsmen of Shechem and all Bethmillo came together and went and made Abimelech their king by the oak of the pillar in Shechem
Jug  Now Jotham on hearing of it went to the top of Mount Gerizim and crying out with a loud voice said to them Give ear to me you townsmen of Shechem so that God may give ear to you
Jug  One day the trees went out to make a king for themselves and they said to the olivetree Be king over us
Jug  But the olivetree said to them Am I to give up my wealth of oil by which men give honour to God and go waving over the trees
Jug  Then the trees said to the figtree You come and be king over us
Jug  But the figtree said to them Am I to give up my sweet taste and my good fruit and go waving over the trees
Jug  Then the trees said to the vine You come and be king over us
Jug  But the vine said to them Am I to give up my wine which makes glad God and men to go waving over the trees
Jug  Then all the trees said to the thorn You come and be king over us
Jug  And the thorn said to the trees If it is truly your desire to make me your king then come and put your faith in my shade and if not may fire come out of the thorn burning up the cedars of Lebanon
Jug  So now if you have done truly and uprightly in making Abimelech king and if you have done well to Jerubbaal and his house in reward for the work of his hands
Jug  For my father made war for you and put his life in danger and made you free from the hands of Midian
Jug  And you have gone against my fathers family this day and have put to death his sons even seventy men on one stone and have made Abimelech the son of his servantwife king over the townsmen of Shechem because he is your brother
Jug  If then you have done what is true and upright to Jerubbaal and his family this day may you have joy in Abimelech and may he have joy in you
Jug  But if not may fire come out from Abimelech burning up the townsmen of Shechem and Bethmillo and may fire come out from the townsmen of Shechem and Bethmillo for the destruction of Abimelech
Jug  Then Jotham straight away went in flight to Beer and was living there for fear of his brother Abimelech
Jug  So Abimelech was chief over Israel for three years
Jug  And God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the townsmen of Shechem and the townsmen of Shechem were false to Abimelech
Jug  So that punishment for the violent attack made on the seventy sons of Jerubbaal and for their blood might come on Abimelech their brother who put them to death and on the townsmen of Shechem who gave him their help in putting his brothers to death
Jug  And the townsmen of Shechem put secret watchers on the tops of the mountains and they made attacks on all who went by on the road and took their goods and word of this came to Abimelech
Jug  Then Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers and went over to Shechem and the men of Shechem put their faith in him
Jug  And they went out into their fields and got in the fruit of their vines and when the grapes had been crushed they made a holy feast and went into the house of their god and over their food and drink they were cursing Abimelech
Jug  And Gaal the son of Ebed said Who is Abimelech and who is Shechem that we are to be his servants Is it not right for the son of Jerubbaal and Zebul his captain to be servants to the men of Hamor the father of Shechem But why are we to be his servants
Jug  If only I had authority over this people I would put Abimelech out of the way and I would say to Abimelech Make your army strong and come out
Jug  Now Zebul the ruler of the town hearing what Gaal the son of Ebed had said was moved to wrath
Jug  And he sent to Abimelech at Arumah saying See Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem and they are working up the town against you
Jug  So now get up by night you and your people and keep watch in the field secretly
Jug  And in the morning when the sun is up get up early and make a rush on the town and when he and his people come out against you do to them whatever you have a chance to do
Jug  So Abimelech and the people with him got up by night in four bands to make a surprise attack on Shechem
Jug  And Gaal the son of Ebed went out and took his place at the doorway into the town then Abimelech and his people got up from the place where they had been waiting
Jug  And when Gaal saw the people he said to Zebul See people are coming down from the tops of the mountains And Zebul said to him You see the shade of the mountains like men
Jug  And Gaal said again See people are coming down from the middle of the land and one band is coming by way of the oaktree of the Seers
Jug  Then Zebul said to him Now where is your loud talk when you said Who is Abimelech that we are to be his servants Is this not the people whom you were rating so low Go out now and make war on them
Jug  So Gaal went out at the head of the townsmen of Shechem and made war on Abimelech
Jug  And Abimelech went after him and he went in flight before him and a great number were falling by the sword all the way up to the town
Jug  Then Abimelech went back to Arumah and Zebul sent Gaal and his brothers away and would not let them go on living in Shechem
Jug  Now the day after the people went out into the fields and news of it came to Abimelech
Jug  And he took his people separating them into three bands and was waiting secretly in the field and when he saw the people coming out of the town he went up and made an attack on them
Jug  And Abimelech with his band made a rush and took up their position at the doorway into the town and the other two bands made a rush on all those who were in the fields and overcame them
Jug  And all that day Abimelech was fighting against the town and he took it and put to death the people who were in it and had the town pulled down and covered with salt
Jug  Then all the townsmen of the tower of Shechem hearing of it went into the inner room of the house of Elberith
Jug  And word was given to Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were there together
Jug  Then Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon with all his people and Abimelech took an axe in his hand and cutting down branches of trees took them and put them on his back And he said to the people who were with him Be quick and do as you have seen me do
Jug  So all the people got branches every man cutting down a branch and they went with Abimelech at their head and massing the branches against the inner room put fire to the room over them so all those who were in the tower of Shechem about a thousand men and women were burned to death with it
Jug  Then Abimelech went to Thebez and put his army in position against Thebez and took it
Jug  But in the middle of the town there was a strong tower to which all the men and women of the town went in flight and shutting themselves in went up to the roof of the tower
Jug  And Abimelech came to the tower and made an attack on it and got near to the door of the tower for the purpose of firing it
Jug  But a certain woman sent a great stone such as is used for crushing grain on to the head of Abimelech cracking the bone
Jug  Then quickly crying out to his bodyservant he said to him Take out your sword and put an end to me straight away so that men may not say of me His death was the work of a woman So the young man put his sword through him causing his death
Jug  And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead they went away every man to his place
Jug  In this way Abimelech was rewarded by God for the evil he had done to his father in putting his seventy brothers to death
Jug  And God sent back on to the heads of the men of Shechem all the evil they had done and the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal came on them
Jug  Now after Abimelech Tola the son of Puah the son of Dodo a man of Issachar became the saviour of Israel he was living in Shamir in the hillcountry of Ephraim
Jug  He was judge over Israel for twentythree years and at his death his body was put to rest in the earth in Shamir
Jug  And after him came Jair the Gileadite who was judge over Israel for twentytwo years
Jug  And he had thirty sons who went on thirty young asses and they had thirty towns in the land of Gilead which are named HavvothJair to this day
Jug  And at the death of Jair his body was put to rest in the earth in Kamon
Jug  And again the children of Israel did evil in the eyes of the Lord worshipping the Baals and Astartes and the gods of Aram and the gods of Zidon and the gods of Moab and the gods of the children of Ammon and the gods of the Philistines they gave up the Lord and were servants to him no longer
Jug  And the wrath of the Lord was burning against Israel and he gave them up into the hands of the Philistines and into the hands of the children of Ammon
Jug  And that year the children of Israel were crushed under their yoke for eighteen years all the children of Israel on the other side of Jordan in the land of the Amorites which is in Gilead were cruelly crushed down
Jug  And the children of Ammon went over Jordan to make war against Judah and Benjamin and the house of Ephraim and Israel was in great trouble
Jug  Then the children of Israel crying out to the Lord said Great is our sin against you for we have given up our God and have been servants to the Baals
Jug  And the Lord said to the children of Israel Were not the Egyptians and the Amorites and the children of Ammon and the Philistines
Jug  And the Zidonians and Amalek and Midian crushing you down and in answer to your cry did I not give you salvation from their hands
Jug  But for all this you have given me up and have been servants to other gods so I will be your saviour no longer
Jug  Go send up your cry for help to the gods of your selection let them be your saviours in the time of your trouble
Jug  And the children of Israel said to the Lord We are sinners do to us whatever seems good to you only give us salvation this day
Jug  So they put away the strange gods from among them and became the Lords servants and his soul was angry because of the sorrows of Israel
Jug  Then the children of Ammon came together and put their army in position in Gilead And the children of Israel came together and put their army in position in Mizpah
Jug  And the people of Israel said to one another Who will be the first to make an attack on the children of Ammon We will make him head over all Gilead
Jug  Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a great man of war he was the son of a loose woman and Gilead was his father
Jug  And Gileads wife gave birth to sons and when her sons became men they sent Jephthah away saying You have no part in the heritage of our fathers house for you are the son of another woman
Jug  So Jephthah went in flight from his brothers and was living in the land of Tob where a number of goodfornothing men joining Jephthah went out with him on his undertakings
Jug  Now after a time the children of Ammon made war against Israel
Jug  And when the children of Ammon made war against Israel the responsible men of Gilead went to get Jephthah back from the land of Tob
Jug  And they said to Jephthah Come and be our chief so that we may make war against the children of Ammon
Jug  But Jephthah said to the responsible men of Gilead Did you not in your hate for me send me away from my fathers house Why do you come to me now when you are in trouble
Jug  And the responsible men of Gilead said to Jephthah That is the reason we have come back to you so go with us and make war against the children of Ammon and we will make you our head over all the people of Gilead
Jug  Then Jephthah said to the responsible men of Gilead If you take me back to make war against the children of Ammon and if with the help of the Lord I overcome them will you make me your head
Jug  And the responsible men of Gilead said to Jephthah May the Lord be our witness we will certainly do as you say
Jug  So Jephthah went with the responsible men of Gilead and the people made him head and chief over them and Jephthah said all these things before the Lord in Mizpah
Jug  Then Jephthah sent men to the king of the children of Ammon saying What have you against me that you have come to make war against my land
Jug  And the king of the children of Ammon said to the men sent by Jephthah Because Israel when he came up out of Egypt took away my land from the Arnon as far as the Jabbok and as far as Jordan so now give me back those lands quietly
Jug  And Jephthah sent again to the king of the children of Ammon
Jug  And said to him This is the word of Jephthah Israel did not take away the land of Moab or the land of the children of Ammon
Jug  But when they came up from Egypt Israel went through the waste land to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh
Jug  Then Israel sent men to the king of Edom saying Let me now go through your land but the king of Edom did not give ear to them And in the same way he sent to the king of Moab but he would not so Israel went on living in Kadesh
Jug  Then he went on through the waste land and round the land of Edom and the land of Moab and came by the east side of the land of Moab and put up their tents on the other side of the Arnon they did not come inside the limit of Moab for the Arnon was the limit of Moab
Jug  And Israel sent men to Sihon king of the Amorites the king of Heshbon and Israel said to him Let me now go through your land to my place
Jug  But Sihon would not give way and let Israel go through his land and Sihon got together all his people and put his army in position in Jahaz and made war on Israel
Jug  And the Lord the God of Israel gave Sihon and all his people into the hands of Israel and they overcame them so all the land of the Amorites the people of that land became Israels
Jug  All the limit of the Amorites was theirs from the Arnon as far as the Jabbok and from the waste land even to Jordan
Jug  So now the Lord the God of Israel has taken away their land from the Amorites and given it to his people Israel are you then to have it
Jug  Do you not keep the lands of those whom Chemosh your god sends out from before you So we will keep all the lands of those whom the Lord our God sends out from before us
Jug  What are you any better than Balak the son of Zippor king of Moab Did he ever take up a cause against Israel or make war against them
Jug  While Israel was living in Heshbon and its daughtertowns and in Aroer and its daughtertowns and in all the towns which are by the side of the Arnon for three hundred years why did you not get them back at that time
Jug  So I have done no wrong against you but you are doing wrong to me in fighting against me may the Lord who is Judge this day be judge between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon
Jug  The king of the children of Ammon however did not give ear to the words which Jephthah sent to him
Jug  Then the spirit of the Lord came on Jephthah and he went through Gilead and Manasseh and came to Mizpeh of Gilead and from Mizpeh of Gilead he went over to the children of Ammon
Jug  And Jephthah took an oath to the Lord and said If you will give the children of Ammon into my hands
Jug  Then whoever comes out from the door of my house meeting me when I come back in peace from the children of Ammon will be the Lords and I will give him as a burned offering
Jug  So Jephthah went over to the children of Ammon to make war on them and the Lord gave them into his hands
Jug  And he made an attack on them from Aroer all the way to Minnith overrunning twenty towns as far as Abelcheramim and put great numbers to the sword So the children of Ammon were crushed before the children of Israel
Jug  Then Jephthah came back to his house in Mizpah and his daughter came out meeting him on his way with music and with dances she was his only child he had no other sons or daughters
Jug  And when he saw her he was overcome with grief and said Ah my daughter I am crushed with sorrow and it is you who are the chief cause of my trouble for I have made an oath to the Lord and I may not take it back
Jug  And she said to him My father you have made an oath to the Lord do then to me whatever you have said for the Lord has sent a full reward on your haters on the children of Ammon
Jug  Then she said to her father Only do this for me let me have two months to go away into the mountains with my friends weeping for my sad fate
Jug  And he said Go then So he sent her away for two months and she went with her friends to the mountains weeping for her sad fate
Jug  And at the end of two months she went back to her father who did with her as he had said in his oath and she had never been touched by a man So it became a rule in Israel
Jug  For the women to go year by year sorrowing for the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in every year
Jug  Now the men of Ephraim came together and took up arms and went over to Zaphon and they said to Jephthah Why did you go over to make war against the children of Ammon without sending for us to go with you Now we will put your house on fire over you
Jug  And Jephthah said to them I and my people were in danger and the children of Ammon were very cruel to us and when I sent for you you gave me no help against them
Jug  So when I saw that there was no help to be had from you I put my life in my hand and went over against the children of Ammon and the Lord gave them into my hands why then have you come up to me this day to make war on me
Jug  Then Jephthah got together all the men of Gilead and made war on Ephraim and the men of Gilead overcame Ephraim
Jug  And the Gileadites took the crossingplaces of Jordan against the Ephraimites and when any of the men of Ephraim who had gone in flight said let me go over the men of Gilead said to him Are you an Ephraimite And if he said No
Jug  Then they said to him Now say Shibboleth and he said Sibboleth and was not able to say it in the right way then they took him and put him to death at the crossingplaces of Jordan and at that time fortytwo thousand Ephraimites were put to death
Jug  Now Jephthah was judge of Israel for six years And Jephthah the Gileadite came to his death and his body was put to rest in his town Mizpeh of Gilead
Jug  And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem was judge of Israel
Jug  He had thirty sons and thirty daughters whom he sent to other places and he got thirty wives from other places for his sons And he was judge of Israel for seven years
Jug  And Ibzan came to his death and his body was put to rest at Bethlehem
Jug  And after him Elon the Zebulonite was judge of Israel and he was judge of Israel for ten years
Jug  And Elon the Zebulonite came to his death and his body was put to rest in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun
Jug  And after him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite was judge of Israel
Jug  He had forty sons and thirty sons sons who went on seventy young asses and he was judge of Israel for eight years
Jug  And Abdon the son of Hillel came to his death and his body was put to rest in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim in the hillcountry of the Amalekites
Jug  And the children of Israel again did evil in the eyes of the Lord and the Lord gave them into the hands of the Philistines for forty years
Jug  Now there was a certain man of Zorah of the family of the Danites and his name was Manoah and his wife had never given birth to a child
Jug  And the angel of the Lord came to the woman and said to her See now though you have never given birth to children you will be with child and give birth to a son
Jug  Now then take care to have no wine or strong drink and to take no unclean thing for food
Jug  For you are with child and will give birth to a son his hair is never to be cut for the child is to be separate to God from his birth and he will take up the work of freeing Israel from the hands of the Philistines
Jug  Then the woman came in and said to her husband A man came to me and his form was like the form of a god causing great fear I put no question to him about where he came from and he did not give me his name
Jug  But he said to me You are with child and will give birth to a son and now do not take any wine or strong drink or let anything unclean be your food for the child will be separate to God from his birth to the day of his death
Jug  Then Manoah made prayer to the Lord and said O Lord let the man of God whom you sent come to us again and make clear to us what we are to do for the child who is to come
Jug  And God gave ear to the voice of Manoah and the angel of God came to the woman again when she was seated in the field but her husband Manoah was not with her
Jug  So the woman running quickly gave her husband the news saying I have seen the man who came to me the other day
Jug  And Manoah got up and went after his wife and came up to the man and said to him Are you the man who was talking to this woman And he said I am
Jug  And Manoah said Now when your words come true what is to be the rule for the child and what will be his work
Jug  And the angel of the Lord said to Manoah Let the woman take note of what I have said to her
Jug  She is to have nothing which comes from the vine for her food and let her take no wine or strong drink or anything which is unclean let her take care to do all I have given her orders to do
Jug  And Manoah said to the angel of the Lord Now let us keep you while we make ready a young goat for you
Jug  And the angel of the Lord said to Manoah Though you keep me I will not take of your food but if you will make a burned offering let it be offered to the Lord For it had not come into Manoahs mind that he was the angel of the Lord
Jug  Then Manoah said to the angel of the Lord What is your name so that when your words come true we may give you honour
Jug  But the angel of the Lord said to him Why are you questioning me about my name seeing that it is a wonder
Jug  So Manoah took the young goat with its meal offering offering it on the rock to the Lord who did strange things
Jug  And when the flame went up to heaven from the altar the angel of the Lord went up in the flame of the altar while Manoah and his wife were looking on and they went down on their faces to the earth
Jug  But the angel of the Lord was seen no more by Manoah and his wife Then it was clear to Manoah that he was the angel of the Lord
Jug  And Manoah said to his wife Death will certainly be our fate for it is a god whom we have seen
Jug  But his wife said to him If the Lord was purposing our death he would not have taken our burned offering and our meal offering or have given us such orders about the child
Jug  So the woman gave birth to a son and gave him the name Samson and he became a man and the blessing of the Lord was on him
Jug  And the spirit of the Lord first came on him in Mahanehdan between Zorah and Eshtaol
Jug  Now Samson went down to Timnah and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines
Jug  And when he came back he said to his father and mother I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines get her now for me for my wife
Jug  Then his father and mother said to him Is there no woman among the daughters of your relations or among all my people that you have to go for your wife to the Philistines who are without circumcision But Samson said to his father Get her for me for she is pleasing to me
Jug  Now his father and mother had no knowledge that this was the purpose of the Lord who had the destruction of the Philistines in mind Now the Philistines at that time were ruling over Israel
Jug  Then Samson went down to Timnah and his father and his mother and came to the vinegardens of Timnah and a young lion came rushing out at him
Jug  And the spirit of the Lord came on him with power and unarmed as he was pulling the lion in two as one might do to a young goat he put him to death but he said nothing to his father and mother of what he had done
Jug  So he went down and had talk with the woman and she was pleasing to Samson
Jug  Then after a time he went back to take her and turning from the road to see the dead body of the lion he saw a mass of bees in the body of the lion and honey there
Jug  And he took the honey in his hand and went on tasting it on the way and when he came to his father and mother he gave some to them but did not say that he had taken the honey from the body of the lion
Jug  Then Samson went down to the woman and made a feast there as was the way among young men
Jug  And he took thirty friends and they were with him
Jug  And Samson said Now I have a hard question for you if you are able to give me the answer before the seven days of the feast are over I will give you thirty linen robes and thirty changes of clothing
Jug  But if you are not able to give me the answer then you will have to give me thirty linen robes and thirty changes of clothing And they said to him Put your hard question and let us see what it is
Jug  And he said Out of the taker of food came food and out of the strong came the sweet And at the end of three days they were still not able to give the answer
Jug  So on the fourth day they said to Samsons wife Get from your husband the answer to his question by some trick or other or we will have you and your fathers house burned with fire did you get us here to take all we have
Jug  Then Samsons wife weeping over him said Truly you have no love for me but only hate you have put a hard question to the children of my people and have not given me the answer And he said to her See I have not given the answer even to my father or my mother am I to give it to you
Jug  And all the seven days of the feast she went on weeping over him and on the seventh day he gave her the answer because she gave him no peace and she sent word of it to the children of her people
Jug  Then on the seventh day before he went into the brides room the men of the town said to him What is sweeter than honey and what is stronger than a lion And he said to them If you had not been ploughing with my cow you would not have got the answer to my question
Jug  And the spirit of the Lord came rushing on him and he went down to Ashkelon and attacking thirty men there took their clothing from them and gave it to the men who had given the answer to his hard question Then full of wrath he went back to his fathers house
Jug  But Samsons wife was given to the friend who had been his best man
Jug  Now a short time after at the time of the graincutting Samson taking with him a young goat went to see his wife and he said I will go in to my wife into the brides room But her father would not let him go in
Jug  And her father said It seemed to me that you had only hate for her so I gave her to your friend but is not her younger sister fairer than she so please take her in place of the other
Jug  Then Samson said to them This time I will give payment in full to the Philistines for I am going to do them great evil
Jug  So Samson went and got three hundred foxes and some sticks of firewood and he put the foxes tail to tail with a stick between every two tails
Jug  Then firing the sticks he let the foxes loose among the uncut grain of the Philistines and all the corded stems as well as the living grain and the vinegardens and the olives went up in flames
Jug  Then the Philistines said Who has done this And they said Samson the soninlaw of the Timnite because he took his wife and gave her to his friend So the Philistines came up and had her and her fathers house burned
Jug  And Samson said to them If you go on like this truly I will take my full payment from you and that will be the end of it
Jug  And he made an attack on them driving them in uncontrolled flight and causing great destruction then he went away to his safe place in the crack of the rock at Etam
Jug  Then the Philistines went and put up their tents in Judah all round Lehi
Jug  And the men of Judah said Why have you come up against us And they said We have come up to take Samson and to do to him as he has done to us
Jug  Then three thousand of the men of Judah went down to the crack of the rock of Etam and said to Samson Is it not clear to you that the Philistines are our rulers What is this you have done to us And he said to them I only did to them as they did to me
Jug  Then they said to him We have come down to take you and give you up into the hands of the Philistines And Samson said to them Give me your oath that you will not make an attack on me yourselves
Jug  And they said No we will take you and give you up into their hands but truly we will not put you to death So knotting two new cords round him they took him up from the rock
Jug  And when he came to Lehi the Philistines came out meeting him with loud cries then the spirit of the Lord came rushing on him and the cords on his arms became like grass which has been burned with fire and the bands came falling off his hands
Jug  And taking up the mouthbone of an ass newly dead which he saw by chance on the earth he put to death a thousand men with it
Jug  And Samson said With a red asss mouthbone I have made them red with blood with a red asss mouthbone I have sent destruction on a thousand men
Jug  And having said these words he let the mouthbone go out of his hand so that place was named Ramathlehi
Jug  After this he was in great need of water and crying out to the Lord he said You have given this great salvation by the hand of your servant and now need of water will be my death and I will be given into the hands of this people who are without circumcision
Jug  Then God made a crack in the hollow rock in Lehi and water came out of it and after drinking his spirit came back to him and he was strong again so that place was named Enhakkore it is in Lehi to this day
Jug  And he was judge of Israel in the days of the Philistines for twenty years
Jug  Now Samson went to Gaza and there he saw a loose woman and went in to her
Jug  And it was said to the Gazites Samson is here So they went round watching for him all day at the doorway of the town but at night they kept quiet saying When daylight comes we will put him to death
Jug  And Samson was there till the middle of the night then he got up and took a grip on the doors of the town pulling them up together with their two supports and their locks and put them on his back and took them up to the top of the hill in front of Hebron
Jug  Now after this he was in love with a woman in the valley of Sorek named Delilah
Jug  And the chiefs of the Philistines came up to her and said to her Make use of your power over him and see what is the secret of his great strength and how we may get the better of him and put bands on him so that we may make him feeble and every one of us will give you eleven hundred shekels of silver
Jug  So Delilah said to Samson Make clear to me now what is the secret of your great strength and how you may be put in bands and made feeble
Jug  And Samson said to her If seven new bowcords which have never been made dry are knotted round me I will become feeble and will be like any other man
Jug  So the chiefs of the Philistines gave her seven new bowcords which had never been made dry and she had them tightly knotted round him
Jug  Now she had men waiting secretly in the inner room and she said to him The Philistines are on you Samson And the cords were broken by him as a twist of thread is broken when touched by a flame So the secret of his strength did not come to light
Jug  Then Delilah said to Samson See you have been making sport of me with false words now say truly how may you be put in bands
Jug  And he said to her If they only put round me new thick cords which have never been used then I will become feeble and will be like any other man
Jug  So Delilah took new thick cords knotting them tightly round him and said to him The Philistines are on you Samson And men were waiting secretly in the inner room And the cords were broken off his arms like threads
Jug  Then Delilah said to Samson Up to now you have made sport of me with false words now say truly how may you be put in bands And he said to her If you get the seven twists of my hair worked into the cloth you are making and fixed with the pin I will become feeble and will be like any other man
Jug  So while he was sleeping she got the seven twists of his hair worked into her cloth and fixed with the pin and said to him The Philistines are on you Samson Then awaking from his sleep he got up quickly pulling up cloth and machine together
Jug  And she said to him Why do you say you are my lover when your heart is not mine Three times you have made sport of me and have not made clear to me the secret of your great strength
Jug  So day after day she gave him no peace for ever questioning him till his soul was troubled to death
Jug  And opening all his heart to her he said to her My head has never been touched by a blade for I have been separate to God from the day of my birth if my hair is cut off then my strength will go from me and I will become feeble and will be like any other man
Jug  And when Delilah saw that he had let her see into his heart she sent word to the chiefs of the Philistines saying Come up this time for he has let out all his heart to me Then the chiefs of the Philistines came to her with the money in their hands
Jug  And she made him go to sleep on her knees and she sent for a man and had his seven twists of hair cut off and while it was being done he became feeble and his strength went from him
Jug  Then she said The Philistines are on you Samson And awaking from his sleep he said I will go out as at other times shaking myself free But he was not conscious that the Lord had gone from him
Jug  So the Philistines took him and put out his eyes then they took him down to Gaza and chaining him with bands of brass put him to work crushing grain in the prisonhouse
Jug  But the growth of his hair was starting again after it had been cut off
Jug  And the chiefs of the Philistines came together to make a great offering to Dagon their god and to be glad for they said Our god has given into our hands Samson our hater
Jug  And when the people saw him they gave praise to their god for they said Our god has given into our hands the one who was fighting against us who made our country waste and who put great numbers of us to death
Jug  Now when their hearts were full of joy they said Send for Samson to make sport for us And they sent for Samson out of the prisonhouse and he made sport before them and they put him between the pillars
Jug  And Samson said to the boy who took him by the hand Let me put my hand on the pillars supporting the house so that I may put my back against them
Jug  Now the house was full of men and women and all the lords of the Philistines were there and about three thousand men and women were on the roof looking on while Samson made sport
Jug  And Samson crying out to the Lord said O Lord God do have me now in mind and do make me strong only this once O God so that I may take one last payment from the Philistines for my two eyes
Jug  Then Samson put his arms round the two middle pillars supporting the house putting his weight on them on one with his right hand and on the other with his left
Jug  And Samson said Let death overtake me with the Philistines And he put out all his strength and the house came down on the chiefs and on all the people who were in it So the dead whom he sent to destruction by his death were more than all those on whom he had sent destruction in his life
Jug  Then his brothers and his fathers people came down and took him up and put his body to rest in the earth between Zorah and Eshtaol in the restingplace of Manoah his father And he had been judge of Israel for twenty years
Jug  Now there was a man of the hillcountry of Ephraim named Micah
Jug  And he said to his mother The eleven hundred shekels of silver which were taken from you about which you took an oath and said in my hearing I have given this silver to the Lord from my hand for myself to make a pictured image and a metal image see I have the silver for I took it so now I will give it back to you And his mother said May the blessing of the Lord be on my son
Jug  And he gave back the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother and his mother said I have made the silver holy to the Lord from me for my son to make a pictured image and a metal image
Jug  So he gave the silver back to his mother Then his mother took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to a metalworker who made a pictured image and a metal image from them and it was in the house of Micah
Jug  And the man Micah had a house of gods and he made an ephod and family gods and put one of his sons in the position of priest
Jug  In those days there was no king in Israel every man did as seemed right to him
Jug  Now there was a young man living in Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah and a Levite who was not a townsman of the place
Jug  And he went away from the town of Bethlehemjudah looking for somewhere to make his livingplace and on his journey he came to the hillcountry of Ephraim to the house of Micah
Jug  And Micah said to him Where do you come from And he said to him I am a Levite from Bethlehemjudah and I am looking for a livingplace
Jug  Then Micah said to him Make your livingplace with me and be a father and a priest to me and I will give you ten shekels of silver a year and your clothing and food
Jug  And the Levite said he would make his livingplace with the man and he became to him as one of his sons
Jug  And Micah gave the position to the Levite and the young man became his priest and was in the house of Micah
Jug  Then Micah said Now I am certain that the Lord will do me good seeing that the Levite has become my priest
Jug  In those days there was no king in Israel and in those days the Danites were looking for a heritage for themselves to be their livingplace for up to that time no distribution of land had been made to them among the tribes of Israel
Jug  So the children of Dan sent five men from among their number strong men from Zorah and from Eshtaol to take a look at the land and make a search through it and they said to them Go and make a search through the land and they came to the hillcountry of Ephraim to the house of Micah where they made a stop for the night
Jug  When they were near the house of Micah hearing a voice which was not strange to them that of the young Levite they went out of their road to his place and said to him How did you come here and what are you doing in this place and why are you here
Jug  And he said to them This is what Micah did for me and he gave me payment and I became his priest
Jug  Then they said Do get directions from God for us to see if the journey on which we are going will have a good outcome
Jug  And the priest said to them Go in peace your way is guided by the Lord
Jug  Then the five men went on their way and came to Laish and saw the people who were there living without thought of danger like the Zidonians quiet and safe for they had everything on earth for their needs and they were far from the Zidonians and had no business with Aram
Jug  So they came back to their brothers in Zorah and Eshtaol and their brothers said to them What news have you
Jug  And they said Up and let us go against Laish for we have seen the land and it is very good why are you doing nothing Do not be slow to go in and take the land for your heritage
Jug  When you come there you will come to a people living without thought of danger and the land is wide and God has given it into your hands a place where there is everything on earth for mans needs
Jug  So six hundred men of the Danites from Zorah and Eshtaol went out armed with instruments of war
Jug  And they went up and put up their tents in Kiriathjearim in Judah so that place is named Mahanehdan to this day It is to the west of Kiriathjearim
Jug  From there they went on to the hillcountry of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah
Jug  Then the five men who had gone to make a search through the country of Laish said to their brothers Have you knowledge that in these houses there is an ephod and family gods and a pictured image and a metal image So now you see what to do
Jug  And turning from their road they came to the house of the young Levite the house of Micah and said to him Is it well with you
Jug  And the six hundred armed men of the Danites took their places by the doorway
Jug  Then the five men who had gone to make a search through the land went in and took the pictured image and the ephod and the family gods and the metal image and the priest was by the doorway with the six hundred armed men
Jug  And when they went into Micahs house and took out the pictured image and the ephod and the family gods and the metal image the priest said to them What are you doing
Jug  And they said to him Be quiet say nothing and come with us and be our father and priest is it better for you to be priest to one mans house or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel
Jug  Then the priests heart was glad and he took the ephod and the family gods and the pictured image and went with the people
Jug  So they went on their way again putting the little ones and the oxen and the goods in front of them
Jug  When they had gone some way from the house of Micah the men from the houses near Micahs house came together and overtook the children of Dan
Jug  Crying out to them And the Danites turning round said to Micah What is your trouble that you have taken up arms
Jug  And he said You have taken my gods which I made and my priest and have gone away what is there for me now Why then do you say to me What is your trouble
Jug  And the children of Dan said to him Say no more or men of bitter spirit may make an attack on you causing loss of your life and the lives of your people
Jug  Then the children of Dan went on their way and when Micah saw that they were stronger than he he went back to his house
Jug  And they took that which Micah had made and his priest and came to Laish to a people living quietly and without thought of danger and they put them to the sword without mercy burning down their town
Jug  And they had no saviour because it was far from Zidon and they had no business with Aram and it was in the valley which is the property of Bethrehob And building up the town again they took it for their livingplace
Jug  And they gave the town the name of Dan after Dan their father who was the son of Israel though the town had been named Laish at first
Jug  And the children of Dan put up the pictured image for themselves and Jonathan the son of Gershom the son of Moses and his sons were priests for the tribe of the Danites till the day when the ark was taken prisoner
Jug  And they put up for themselves the image which Micah had made and it was there all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh
Jug  Now in those days when there was no king in Israel a certain Levite was living in the inmost parts of the hillcountry of Ephraim and he got for himself a servantwife from Bethlehemjudah
Jug  And his servantwife was angry with him and went away from him to her fathers house at Bethlehemjudah and was there for four months
Jug  Then her husband got up and went after her with the purpose of talking kindly to her and taking her back with him he had with him his young man and two asses and she took him into her fathers house and her father when he saw him came forward to him with joy
Jug  And his fatherinlaw the girls father kept him there for three days and they had food and drink and took their rest there
Jug  Now on the fourth day they got up early in the morning and he made ready to go away but the girls father said to his soninlaw Take a little food to keep up your strength and then go on your way
Jug  So seating themselves they had food and drink the two of them together and the girls father said to the man If it is your pleasure take your rest here tonight and let your heart be glad
Jug  And the man got up to go away but his fatherinlaw would not let him go so he took his rest there again for the night
Jug  Then early on the morning of the fifth day he got up to go away but the girls father said Keep up your strength so the two of them had a meal and the man and his woman and his servant did not go till after the middle of the day
Jug  And when they got up to go away his fatherinlaw the girls father said to him Now evening is coming on so do not go tonight see the day is almost gone take your rest here and let your heart be glad and tomorrow early go on your way back to your house
Jug  But the man would not be kept there that night and he got up and went away and came opposite to Jebus which is Jerusalem and he had with him the two asses ready for travelling and his woman
Jug  When they got near Jebus the day was far gone and the servant said to his master Now let us go from our road into this town of the Jebusites and take our nights rest there
Jug  But his master said to him We will not go out of our way into a strange town whose people are not of the children of Israel but we will go on to Gibeah
Jug  And he said to his servant Come let us go on to one of these places stopping for the night in Gibeah or Ramah
Jug  So they went on their way and the sun went down when they were near Gibeah in the land of Benjamin
Jug  And they went off the road there with the purpose of stopping for the night in Gibeah and he went in seating himself in the street of the town for no one took them into his house for the night
Jug  Now when it was evening they saw an old man coming back from his work in the fields he was from the hillcountry of Ephraim and was living in Gibeah but the men of the place were Benjamites
Jug  And when he saw the traveller in the street of the town the old man said Where are you going and where do you come from
Jug  And he said to him We are on our way from Bethlehemjudah to the inmost parts of the hillcountry of Ephraim I came from there and went to Bethlehemjudah now I am on my way back to my house but no man will take me into his house
Jug  But we have dry grass and food for our asses as well as bread and wine for me and for the woman and for the young man with us we have no need of anything
Jug  And the old man said Peace be with you let all your needs be my care only do not take your rest in the street
Jug  So he took them into his house and gave the asses food and after washing their feet they took food and drink
Jug  While they were taking their pleasure at the meal the goodfornothing men of the town came round the house giving blows on the door and they said to the old man the master of the house Send out that man who came to your house so that we may take our pleasure with him
Jug  So the man the master of the house went out to them and said No my brothers do not this evil thing this man has come into my house and you are not to do him this wrong
Jug  See here is my daughter a virgin and his servantwife I will send them out for you to take them and do with them whatever you will But do no such thing of shame to this man
Jug  But the men would not give ear to him so the man took his woman and sent her out to them and they took her by force using her for their pleasure all night till the morning and when dawn came they let her go
Jug  Then at the dawn of day the woman came and falling down at the door of the mans house where her master was was stretched there till it was light
Jug  In the morning her master got up and opening the door of the house went out to go on his way and he saw his servantwife stretched on the earth at the door of the house with her hands on the step
Jug  And he said to her Get up and let us be going but there was no answer so he took her up and put her on the ass and went on his way and came to his house
Jug  And when he had come to his house he got his knife and took the woman cutting her up bone by bone into twelve parts which he sent through all Israel
Jug  And he gave orders to the men whom he sent saying This is what you are to say to all the men of Israel Has ever an act like this been done from the day when the children of Israel came out of Egypt to this day Give thought to it turning it over in your minds and give your opinion of it
Jug  Then all the children of Israel took up arms and the people came together like one man from Dan to Beersheba and the land of Gilead before the Lord at Mizpah
Jug  And the chiefs of the people out of all the tribes of Israel took their places in the meeting of the people of God four hundred thousand footmen armed with swords
Jug  Now the children of Benjamin had word that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah And the children of Israel said Make clear how this evil thing took place
Jug  Then the Levite the husband of the dead woman said in answer I came to Gibeah in the land of Benjamin I and my servantwife for the purpose of stopping there for the night
Jug  And the townsmen of Gibeah came together against me going round the house on all sides by night it was their purpose to put me to death and my servantwife was violently used by them and is dead
Jug  So I took her cutting her into parts which I sent through all the country of the heritage of Israel for they have done an act of shame in Israel
Jug  Here you all are you children of Israel give now your suggestions about what is to be done
Jug  Then all the people got up as one man and said Not one of us will go to his tent or go back to his house
Jug  But this is what we will do to Gibeah we will go up against it by the decision of the Lord
Jug  And we will take ten men out of every hundred through all the tribes of Israel a hundred out of every thousand a thousand out of every ten thousand to get food for the people so that they may give to Gibeah of Benjamin the right punishment for the act of shame they have done in Israel
Jug  So all the men of Israel were banded together against the town united like one man
Jug  And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin saying What is this evil which has been done among you
Jug  Now give up those goodfornothing persons in Gibeah so that we may put them to death clearing away the evil from Israel But the children of Benjamin would not give ear to the voice of their brothers the children of Israel
Jug  And the children of Benjamin came together from all their towns to Gibeah to go to war with the children of Israel
Jug  And the children of Benjamin who came that day from the towns were twentysix thousand men armed with swords in addition to the people of Gibeah numbering seven hundred of the best fightingmen
Jug  Who were lefthanded able to send a stone at a hair without error
Jug  And the men of Israel other than Benjamin were four hundred thousand in number all armed with swords they were all men of war
Jug  And they got up and went up to Bethel to get directions from God and the children of Israel said Who is to be the first to go up to the fight against the children of Benjamin And the Lord said Judah is to go up first
Jug  So the children of Israel got up in the morning and put themselves in position against Gibeah
Jug  And the men of Israel went out to war against Benjamin and the men of Israel put their forces in fighting order against them at Gibeah
Jug  Then the children of Benjamin came out from Gibeah cutting down twentytwo thousand of the Israelites that day
Jug  But the people the men of Israel taking heart again put their forces in order and took up the same position as on the first day
Jug  Now the children of Israel went up weeping before the Lord till evening requesting the Lord and saying Am I to go forward again to the fight against the children of Benjamin my brother And the Lord said Go up against him
Jug  So the children of Israel went forward against the children of Benjamin the second day
Jug  And the second day Benjamin went out against them from Gibeah cutting down eighteen thousand men of the children of Israel all swordsmen
Jug  Then all the children of Israel and all the people went up to Bethel weeping and waiting there before the Lord going without food all day till evening and offering burned offerings and peaceofferings before the Lord
Jug  And the children of Israel made request to the Lord for the ark of the agreement of the Lord was there in those days
Jug  And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron was in his place before it and said Am I still to go on with the fight against the children of Benjamin my brother or am I to give it up And the Lord said Go on for tomorrow I will give him into your hands
Jug  So Israel put men secretly all round Gibeah to make a surprise attack on it
Jug  And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day and put themselves in fighting order against Gibeah as before
Jug  And the children of Benjamin went out against the people moving away from the town and as before at their first attack they put to death about thirty men of Israel on the highways of which one goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah and in the open country
Jug  And the children of Benjamin said They are giving way before us as at first But the children of Israel said Let us go in flight and get them away from the town into the highways
Jug  So all the men of Israel got up and put themselves in fighting order at Baaltamar and those who had been waiting secretly to make a surprise attack came rushing out of their place on the west of Geba
Jug  And they came in front of Gibeah ten thousand of the best men in all Israel and the fighting became more violent but the children of Benjamin were not conscious that evil was coming on them
Jug  Then the Lord sent sudden fear on Benjamin before Israel and that day the children of Israel put to death twentyfive thousand one hundred men of Benjamin all of them swordsmen
Jug  So the children of Benjamin saw that they were overcome and the men of Israel had given way before Benjamin putting their faith in the watchers who were to make the surprise attack on Gibeah
Jug  And the watchers rushing on Gibeah and overrunning it put all the town to the sword without mercy
Jug  Now the sign fixed between the men of Israel and those making the surprise attack was that when they made a pillar of smoke go up from the town
Jug  The men of Israel were to make a turn about in the fight And Benjamin had overcome and put to death about thirty of the men of Israel and were saying Certainly they are falling back before us as in the first fight
Jug  Then the sign went up out of the town in the pillar of smoke and the Benjamites turning back saw all the town going up in smoke to heaven
Jug  And the men of Israel had made a turn about and the men of Benjamin were overcome with fear for they saw that evil had overtaken them
Jug  So turning their backs on the men of Israel they went in the direction of the waste land but the fight overtook them and those who came out of the town were heading them off and putting them to the sword
Jug  And crushing Benjamin down they went after them driving them from Nohah as far as the east side of Gibeah
Jug  Eighteen thousand men of Benjamin came to their death all strong men of war
Jug  And turning they went in flight to the rock of Rimmon in the waste land and on the highways five thousand of them were cut off by the men of Israel who pushing on hard after them to Geba put to death two thousand more
Jug  So twentyfive thousand of the swordsmen of Benjamin came to their end that day all strong men of war
Jug  But six hundred men turning back went in flight to the rock of Rimmon in the waste land and were living on the rock of Rimmon for four months
Jug  And the men of Israel turning again against the children of Benjamin put to the sword without mercy all the towns and the cattle and everything there was burning every town which came into their hands
Jug  Now the men of Israel had taken an oath in Mizpah saying Not one of us will give his daughter as a wife to Benjamin
Jug  And the people came to Bethel waiting there till evening before God and gave themselves up to bitter weeping
Jug  And they said O Lord the God of Israel why has this fate come on Israel that today one tribe has been cut off from Israel
Jug  Then on the day after the people got up early and made an altar there offering burned offerings and peaceofferings
Jug  And the children of Israel said Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who did not come up to the Lord at the meeting of all Israel For they had taken a great oath that whoever did not come up to Mizpah to the Lord was to be put to death
Jug  And the children of Israel were moved with pity for Benjamin their brother saying Today one tribe has been cut off from Israel
Jug  What are we to do about wives for those who are still living For we have taken an oath by the Lord that we will not give them our daughters for wives
Jug  And they said Which one of the tribes of Israel did not come up to Mizpah to the Lord And it was seen that no one had come from Jabeshgilead to the meeting
Jug  For when the people were numbered not one man of the people of Jabeshgilead was present
Jug  So they the meeting sent twelve thousand of the best fightingmen and gave them orders saying Go and put the people of Jabeshgilead to the sword without mercy with their women and their little ones
Jug  And this is what you are to do every male and every woman who has had sex relations with a man you are to put to the curse but you are to keep safe the virgins And they did so
Jug  Now there were among the people of Jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins who had never had sex relations with a man these they took to their tents in Shiloh in the land of Canaan
Jug  And all the meeting sent to the men of Benjamin who were in the rock of Rimmon offering them peace
Jug  Then Benjamin came back and they gave them the women whom they had kept from death among the women of Jabeshgilead but still there were not enough for them
Jug  And the people were moved with pity for Benjamin because the Lord had let his wrath loose on the tribes of Israel
Jug  Then the responsible men of the meeting said What are we to do about wives for the rest of them seeing that the women of Benjamin are dead
Jug  And they said How is the rest of Benjamin to be given offspring so that one tribe of Israel may not be put out of existence
Jug  Seeing that we may not give them our daughters as wives For the children of Israel had taken an oath saying Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin
Jug  And they said See every year there is a feast of the Lord in Shiloh which is to the north of Bethel on the east side of the highway which goes up from Bethel to Shechem and on the south of Lebonah
Jug  And they said to the men of Benjamin Go into the vinegardens waiting there secretly
Jug  And watching and if the daughters of Shiloh come out to take part in the dances then come from the vinegardens and take a wife for every one of you from among the daughters of Shiloh and go back to the land of Benjamin
Jug  And when their fathers or their brothers come and make trouble you are to say to them Give them to us as an act of grace for we did not take them as wives for ourselves in war and if you yourselves had given them to us you would have been responsible for the broken oath
Jug  So the men of Benjamin did this and got wives for themselves for every one of their number taking them away by force from the dance then they went back to their heritage building up their towns and living in them
Jug  Then the children of Israel went away from there every man to his tribe and his family every man went back to his heritage
Jug  In those days there was no king in Israel every man did what seemed right to him
Rut  Now there came a time in the days of the judges when there was no food in the land And a certain man went from Bethlehemjudah he and his wife and his two sons to make a livingplace in the country of Moab
Rut  And the name of the man was Elimelech and the name of his wife Naomi and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah And they came into the country of Moab and were there for some time
Rut  And Elimelech Naomis husband came to his end and only her two sons were with her
Rut  And they took two women of Moab as their wives the name of the one was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth and they went on living there for about ten years
Rut  And Mahlon and Chilion came to their end and the woman was without her two sons and her husband
Rut  So she and her daughtersinlaw got ready to go back from the country of Moab for news had come to her in the country of Moab that the Lord in mercy for his people had given them food
Rut  And she went out of the place where she was and her two daughtersinlaw with her and they went on their way to go back to the land of Judah
Rut  And Naomi said to her two daughtersinlaw Go back to your mothers houses may the Lord be good to you as you have been good to the dead and to me
Rut  May the Lord give you rest in the houses of your husbands Then she gave them a kiss and they were weeping bitterly
Rut  And they said to her No but we will go back with you to your people
Rut  But Naomi said Go back my daughters why will you come with me Have I more sons in my body to become your husbands
Rut  Go back my daughters and go on your way I am so old now that I may not have another husband If I said I have hopes if I had a husband tonight and might have sons
Rut  Would you keep yourselves till they were old enough would you keep from having husbands for them No my daughters but I am very sad for you that the hand of the Lord is against me
Rut  Then again they were weeping and Orpah gave her motherinlaw a kiss but Ruth would not be parted from her
Rut  And Naomi said See your sisterinlaw has gone back to her people and to her gods go back after your sisterinlaw
Rut  But Ruth said Give up requesting me to go away from you or to go back without you for where you go I will go and where you take your rest I will take my rest your people will be my people and your God my God
Rut  Wherever death comes to you death will come to me and there will be my last restingplace the Lord do so to me and more if we are parted by anything but death
Rut  And when she saw that Ruth was strong in her purpose to go with her she said no more
Rut  So the two of them went on till they came to Bethlehem And when they came to Bethlehem all the town was moved about them and they said Is this Naomi
Rut  And she said to them Do not let my name be Naomi but Mara for the Ruler of all has given me a bitter fate
Rut  I went out full and the Lord has sent me back again with nothing why do you give me the name Naomi seeing that the Lord has given witness against me and the Ruler of all has sent sorrow on me
Rut  So Naomi came back out of the country of Moab and Ruth the Moabitess her daughterinlaw with her and they came to Bethlehem in the first days of the graincutting
Rut  And Naomi had a relation of her husband a man of wealth of the family of Elimelech and his name was Boaz
Rut  And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi Now let me go into the field and take up the heads of grain after him in whose eyes I may have grace And she said to her Go my daughter
Rut  And she went and came and took up the heads of grain in the field after the cutters and by chance she went into that part of the field which was the property of Boaz who was of the family of Elimelech
Rut  And Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the graincutters The Lord be with you And they made answer The Lord give you his blessing
Rut  Then Boaz said to his servant who was in authority over the cutters Whose girl is this
Rut  And the servant who was in authority over the cutters said It is a Moabite girl who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab
Rut  And she said to me Let me come into the grainfield and take up the grain after the cutters So she came and has been here from morning till now without resting even for a minute
Rut  Then said Boaz to Ruth Give ear to me my daughter do not go to take up the grain in another field or go away from here but keep here by my young women
Rut  Keep your eyes on the field they are cutting and go after them have I not given orders to the young men not to put a hand on you And when you are in need of drink go to the vessels and take of what the young men have put there
Rut  Then she went down on her face to the earth and said to him Why have I grace in your eyes that you give attention to me seeing I am from a strange people
Rut  And Boaz answering said to her I have had news of everything you have done for your motherinlaw after the death of your husband how you went away from your father and mother and the land of your birth and came to a people who are strange to you
Rut  The Lord give you a reward for what you have done and may a full reward be given to you by the Lord the God of Israel under whose wings you have come to take cover
Rut  Then she said May I have grace in your eyes my lord for you have given me comfort and you have said kind words to your servant though I am not like one of your servants
Rut  And at mealtime Boaz said to her Come here and take some of the bread and put your bit into the wine And she took her seat among the graincutters and he gave her dry grain and she took it and there was more than enough for her meal
Rut  And when she got ready to take up the grain Boaz gave his young men orders saying Let her take it even from among the cut grain and say nothing to her
Rut  And let some heads of grain be pulled out of what has been corded up and dropped for her to take and let no sharp word be said to her
Rut  So she went on getting together the heads of grain till evening and after crushing out the seed it came to about an ephah of grain
Rut  And she took it up and went into the town and she let her motherinlaw see what she had got and after taking enough for herself she gave her the rest
Rut  And her motherinlaw said to her Where did you take up the grain today and where were you working May a blessing be on him who gave such attention to you And she gave her motherinlaw an account of where she had been working and said The name of the man with whom I was working today is Boaz
Rut  And Naomi said to her daughterinlaw May the blessing of the Lord who has at all times been kind to the living and to the dead be on him And Naomi said to her The man is of our family one of our near relations
Rut  And Ruth the Moabitess said Truly he said to me Keep near my young men till all my grain is cut
Rut  And Naomi said to Ruth her daughterinlaw It is better my daughter for you to go out with his servantgirls so that no danger may come to you in another field
Rut  So she kept near the servantgirls of Boaz to take up the grain till the cutting of the early grain and the cutting of the late grain were ended and she went on living with her motherinlaw
Rut  And Naomi her motherinlaw said to her My daughter am I not to get you a restingplace where you may be in comfort
Rut  And now is there not Boaz our relation with whose young women you were See tonight he is separating the grain from the waste in his grainfloor
Rut  So take a bath and after rubbing your body with sweet oil put on your best robe and go down to the grainfloor but do not let him see you till he has come to the end of his meal
Rut  But see to it when he goes to rest that you take note of the place where he is sleeping and go in there and uncovering his feet take your place by him and he will say what you are to do
Rut  And she said I will do all you say
Rut  So she went down to the grainfloor and did all her motherinlaw had said to her
Rut  Now when Boaz had taken meat and drink and his heart was glad he went to take his rest at the end of the mass of grain then she came softly and uncovering his feet went to rest
Rut  Now in the middle of the night the man awaking from his sleep in fear and lifting himself up saw a woman stretched at his feet
Rut  And he said Who are you And she answering said I am your servant Ruth take your servant as wife for you are a near relation
Rut  And he said May the Lord give you his blessing my daughter even better than what you did at the first is this last kind act you have done in not going after young men with or without wealth
Rut  And now my daughter have no fear I will do for you whatever you say for it is clear to all my townspeople that you are a woman of virtue
Rut  Now it is true that I am a near relation but there is a relation nearer than I
Rut  Take your rest here tonight and in the morning if he will do for you what it is right for a relation to do very well let him do so but if he will not then by the living Lord I myself will do so
Rut  And she took her rest at his feet till the morning and she got up before it was light enough for one to see another And he said Let it not come to anyones knowledge that the woman came to the grainfloor
Rut  And he said Take your robe stretching it out in your hands and she did so and he took six measures of grain and put them into it and gave it her to take and she went back to the town
Rut  And when she came back her motherinlaw said to her How did it go with you my daughter And she gave her an account of all the man had done to her
Rut  And she said He gave me these six measures of grain saying Do not go back to your motherinlaw with nothing in your hands
Rut  Then she said Do nothing now my daughter till you see what will come of this for the man will take no rest till he has put this thing through
Rut  And Boaz went up to the public place of the town and took his seat there and the near relation of whom he had been talking came by and Boaz crying out to him by name said Come and be seated here And he came and was seated
Rut  Then he got ten of the responsible men of the town and said Be seated here And they took their seats
Rut  Then he said to the near relation Naomi who has come back from the country of Moab is offering for a price that bit of land which was our brother Elimelechs
Rut  And it was in my mind to give you the chance of taking it with the approval of those seated here and of the responsible men of my people If you are ready to do what it is right for a relation to do then do it but if you will not do it say so to me now for there is no one who has the right to do it but you and after you myself And he said I will do it
Rut  Then Boaz said On the day when you take this field you will have to take with it Ruth the Moabitess the wife of the dead so that you may keep the name of the dead living in his heritage
Rut  And the near relation said I am not able to do the relations part for fear of damaging the heritage I have you may do it in my place for I am not able to do it myself
Rut  Now in earlier times this was the way in Israel when property was taken over by a near relation or when there was a change of owner To make the exchange certain one man took off his shoe and gave it to the other and this was a witness in Israel
Rut  So the near relation said to Boaz Take it for yourself And he took off his shoe
Rut  Then Boaz said to the responsible men and to all the people You are witnesses today that I have taken at a price from Naomi all the property which was Elimelechs and everything which was Chilions and Mahlons
Rut  And further I have taken Ruth the Moabitess who was the wife of Mahlon to be my wife to keep the name of the dead man living in his heritage so that his name may not be cut off from among his countrymen and from the memory of his town you are witnesses this day
Rut  And all the people who were in the public place and the responsible men said We are witnesses May the Lord make this woman who is about to come into your house like Rachel and Leah which two were the builders of the house of Israel and may you have wealth in Ephrathah and be great in Bethlehem
Rut  May your family be like the family of Perez the son whom Tamar gave to Judah from the offspring which the Lord may give you by this young woman
Rut  So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife and he went in to her and the Lord made her with child and she gave birth to a son
Rut  And the women said to Naomi A blessing on the Lord who has not let you be this day without a near relation and may his name be great in Israel
Rut  He will be a giver of new life to you and your comforter when you are old for your daughterinlaw who in her love for you is better than seven sons has given birth to him
Rut  And Naomi took the child and put her arms round it and she took care of it
Rut  And the women who were her neighbours gave it a name saying Naomi has a child and they gave him the name of Obed he is the father of Jesse the father of David
Rut  Now these are the generations of Perez Perez became the father of Hezron
Rut  And Hezron became the father of Ram and Ram became the father of Amminadab
Rut  And Amminadab became the father of Nahshon and Nahshon became the father of Salmon
Rut  And Salmon became the father of Boaz and Boaz became the father of Obed
Rut  And Obed became the father of Jesse and Jesse became the father of David
Sa  Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim a Zuphite of the hillcountry of Ephraim named Elkanah he was the son of Jeroham the son of Elihu the son of Tohu the son of Zuph an Ephraimite
Sa  And he had two wives one named Hannah and the other Peninnah and Peninnah was the mother of children but Hannah had no children
Sa  Now this man went up from his town every year to give worship and to make offerings to the Lord of armies in Shiloh And the two sons of Eli Hophni and Phinehas the priests of the Lord were there
Sa  And when the day came for Elkanah to make his offering he gave to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters their part of the feast
Sa  But to Hannah he gave one part though Hannah was very dear to him but the Lord had not let her have children
Sa  And the other wife did everything possible to make her unhappy because the Lord had not let her have children
Sa  And year by year whenever she went up to the house of the Lord she kept on attacking her so that Hannah gave herself up to weeping and would take no food
Sa  Then her husband Elkanah said to her Hannah why are you weeping and why are you taking no food why is your heart troubled am I not more to you than ten sons
Sa  So after they had taken food and wine in the guest room Hannah got up Now Eli the priest was seated by the pillars of the doorway of the Temple of the Lord
Sa  And with grief in her soul weeping bitterly she made her prayer to the Lord
Sa  And she made an oath and said O Lord of armies if you will truly take note of the sorrow of your servant not turning away from me but keeping me in mind and will give me a manchild then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life and his hair will never be cut
Sa  Now while she was a long time in prayer before the Lord Eli was watching her mouth
Sa  For Hannahs prayer came from her heart and though her lips were moving she made no sound so it seemed to Eli that she was overcome with wine
Sa  And Eli said to her How long are you going to be the worse for drink Put away the effects of your wine from you
Sa  And Hannah answering him said No my lord I am a woman whose spirit is broken with sorrow I have not taken wine or strong drink but I have been opening my heart before the Lord
Sa  Do not take your servant to be a goodfornothing woman for my words have come from my storedup sorrow and pain
Sa  Then Eli said to her Go in peace and may the God of Israel give you an answer to the prayer you have made to him
Sa  And she said May your servant have grace in your eyes So the woman went away and took part in the feast and her face was no longer sad
Sa  And early in the morning they got up and after worshipping before the Lord they went back to Ramah to their house and Elkanah had connection with his wife and the Lord kept her in mind
Sa  Now the time came when Hannah being with child gave birth to a son and she gave him the name Samuel Because she said I made a prayer to the Lord for him
Sa  And the man Elkanah with all his family went up to make the years offering to the Lord and to give effect to his oath
Sa  But Hannah did not go for she said to her husband I will not go till the child has been taken from the breast and then I will take him with me and put him before the Lord where he may be for ever
Sa  And her husband Elkanah said to her Do whatever seems right to you but not till you have taken him from the breast only may the Lord do as he has said So the woman waiting there gave her son milk till he was old enough to be taken from the breast
Sa  Then when she had done so she took him with her with a threeyear old ox and an ephah of meal and a skin full of wine and took him to the house of the Lord at Shiloh now the child was still very young
Sa  And when they had made an offering of the ox they took the child to Eli
Sa  And she said O my lord as your soul is living my lord I am that woman who was making a prayer to the Lord here by your side
Sa  My prayer was for this child and the Lord has given him to me in answer to my request
Sa  So I have given him to the Lord for all his life he is the Lords Then he gave the Lord worship there
Sa  And Hannah in prayer before the Lord said My heart is glad in the Lord my horn is lifted up in the Lord my mouth is open wide over my haters because my joy is in your salvation
Sa  No other is holy as the Lord for there is no other God but you there is no Rock like our God
Sa  Say no more words of pride let not uncontrolled sayings come out of your mouths for the Lord is a God of knowledge by him acts are judged
Sa  The bows of the men of war are broken and the feeble are clothed with strength
Sa  Those who were full are offering themselves as servants for bread those who were in need are at rest truly she who had no children has become the mother of seven and she who had a family is wasted with sorrow
Sa  The Lord is the giver of death and life sending men down to the underworld and lifting them up
Sa  The Lord gives wealth and takes a mans goods from him crushing men down and again lifting them up
Sa  Lifting the poor out of the dust and him who is in need out of the lowest place to give them their place among rulers and for their heritage the seat of glory for the pillars of the earth are the Lords and he has made them the base of the world
Sa  He will keep the feet of his holy ones but the evildoers will come to their end in the dark night for by strength no man will overcome
Sa  Those who make war against the Lord will be broken against them he will send his thunder from heaven the Lord will be judge of the ends of the earth he will give strength to his king lifting up the horn of him on whom the holy oil has been put
Sa  Then Elkanah went to Ramah to his house And the child became the servant of the Lord under the direction of Eli the priest
Sa  Now the sons of Eli were evil and goodfornothing men having no knowledge of the Lord
Sa  And the priests way with the people was this when any man made an offering the priests servant came while the flesh was being cooked having in his hand a meathook with three teeth
Sa  This he put into the pot and everything which came up on the hook the priest took for himself This they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there
Sa  And more than this before the fat was burned the priests servant would come and say to the man who was making the offering Give me some of the flesh to be cooked for the priest he has no taste for meat cooked in water but would have you give it uncooked
Sa  And if the man said to him First let the fat be burned then take as much as you will then the servant would say No you are to give it to me now or I will take it by force
Sa  And the sin of these young men was very great before the Lord for they gave no honour to the Lords offerings
Sa  But Samuel did the work of the Lords house while he was a child dressed in a linen ephod
Sa  And his mother made him a little robe and took it to him every year when she came with her husband for the years offering
Sa  And every year Eli gave Elkanah and his wife a blessing saying May the Lord give you offspring by this woman in exchange for the child you have given to the Lord And they went back to their house
Sa  And the Lord had mercy on Hannah and she gave birth to three sons and two daughters And the young Samuel became older before the Lord
Sa  Now Eli was very old and he had news from time to time of what his sons were doing to all Israel
Sa  And he said to them Why are you doing such things for from all this people I get accounts of your evil ways
Sa  No my sons the account which is given me which the Lords people are sending about is not good
Sa  If one man does wrong to another God will be his judge but if a mans sin is against the Lord who will take up his cause But they gave no attention to the voice of their father for it was the Lords purpose to send destruction on them
Sa  And the young Samuel becoming older had the approval of the Lord and of men
Sa  And a man of God came to Eli and said to him The Lord says Did I let myself be seen by your fathers people when they were in Egypt servants in Pharaohs house
Sa  Did I take him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest and to go up to my altar to make the smoke of the offerings go up and to take up the ephod Did I give to your fathers family all the offerings made by fire by the children of Israel
Sa  Why then are you looking with envy on my offerings of meat and of meal which were ordered by my word honouring your sons before me and making yourselves fat with all the best of the offerings of Israel my people
Sa  For this reason the Lord God of Israel has said Truly I did say that your family and your fathers people would have their place before me for ever but now the Lord says Let it not be so I will give honour to those by whom I am honoured and those who have no respect for me will be of small value in my eyes
Sa  See the days are coming when your arm and the arm of your fathers people will be cut off
Sa  And never again will there be an old man in your family
Sa  But one man of your family will not be cut off by my hand and his eyes will be made dark and grief will be in his heart and all the offspring of your family will come to their end by the sword of men
Sa  And this will be the sign to you which will come on Hophni and Phinehas your sons death will overtake them on the same day
Sa  And I will make a true priest for myself one who will do what is in my heart and in my mind and I will make for him a family which will not come to an end and his place will be before my holy one for ever
Sa  Then it will be that the rest of your family anyone who has not been cut off will go down on his knees to him for a bit of silver or a bit of bread and say Be pleased to put me into one of the priests places so that I may have a little food
Sa  Now the young Samuel was the servant of the Lord before Eli In those days the Lord kept his word secret from men there was no open vision
Sa  And at that time when Eli was resting in his place now his eyes were becoming clouded so that he was not able to see
Sa  And the light of God was still burning while Samuel was sleeping in the Temple of the Lord where the ark of God was
Sa  The voice of the Lord said Samuels name and he said Here am I
Sa  And running to Eli he said Here am I for you said my name And Eli said I did not say your name go to your rest again So he went back to his bed
Sa  And again the Lord said Samuel And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said Here am I for you certainly said my name But he said in answer I said nothing my son go to your rest again
Sa  Now at that time Samuel had no knowledge of the Lord and the revelation of the word of the Lord had not come to him
Sa  And for the third time the Lord said Samuels name And he got up and went to Eli and said Here am I for you certainly said my name Then it was clear to Eli that the voice which had said the childs name was the Lords
Sa  So Eli said to Samuel Go back and if the voice comes again let your answer be Say on Lord for the ears of your servant are open So Samuel went back to his bed
Sa  Then the Lord came and said as before Samuel Samuel Then Samuel made answer Say on Lord for the ears of your servant are open
Sa  And the Lord said to Samuel See I will do a thing in Israel at which the ears of everyone hearing of it will be burning
Sa  In that day I will do to Eli everything which I have said about his family from first to last
Sa  And you are to say to him that I will send punishment on his family for ever for the sin which he had knowledge of because his sons have been cursing God and he had no control over them
Sa  So I have made an oath to the family of Eli that no offering of meat or of meal which they may make will ever take away the sin of his family
Sa  And Samuel kept where he was not moving till the time came for opening the doors of the house of God in the morning And fear kept him from giving Eli an account of his vision
Sa  Then Eli said Samuel my son And Samuel answering said Here am I
Sa  And he said What did the Lord say to you Do not keep it from me may Gods punishment be on you if you keep from me anything he said to you
Sa  Then Samuel gave him an account of everything keeping nothing back And he said It is the Lord let him do what seems good to him
Sa  And Samuel became older and the Lord was with him and let not one of his words be without effect
Sa  And it was clear to all Israel from Dan to Beersheba that Samuel had been made a prophet of the Lord
Sa  And the Lord was seen again in Shiloh for the Lord gave to Samuel in Shiloh the revelation of his word
Sa  Now at that time the Philistines came together to make war against Israel and the men of Israel went out to war against the Philistines and took up their position at the side of Ebenezer and the Philistines put their forces in position in Aphek
Sa  And the Philistines put their forces in order against Israel and the fighting was hard and Israel was overcome by the Philistines who put to the sword about four thousand of their army in the field
Sa  And when the people came back to their tents the responsible men of Israel said Why has the Lord let the Philistines overcome us today Let us get the ark of the Lords agreement here from Shiloh so that it may be with us and give us salvation from the hands of those who are against us
Sa  So the people sent to Shiloh and got the ark of the agreement of the Lord of armies whose restingplace is between the winged ones and Hophni and Phinehas the two sons of Eli were there with the ark of Gods agreement
Sa  And when the ark of the Lords agreement came into the tentcircle all Israel gave a great cry so that the earth was sounding with it
Sa  And the Philistines hearing the noise of their cry said What is this great cry among the tents of the Hebrews Then it became clear to them that the ark of the Lord had come to the tentcircle
Sa  And the Philistines full of fear said God has come into their tents And they said Trouble is ours for never before has such a thing been seen
Sa  Trouble is ours Who will give us salvation from the hands of these great gods These are the gods who sent all sorts of blows on the Egyptians in the waste land
Sa  Be strong O Philistines be men Do not be servants to the Hebrews as they have been to you go forward to the fight without fear
Sa  So the Philistines went to the fight and Israel was overcome and every man went in flight to his tent and great was the destruction for thirty thousand footmen of Israel were put to the sword
Sa  And the ark of God was taken and Hophni and Phinehas the sons of Eli were put to the sword
Sa  And a man of Benjamin went running from the fight and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothing out of order and earth on his head
Sa  And when he came Eli was seated by the wayside watching and in his heart was fear for the ark of God And when the man came into the town and gave the news there was a great outcry
Sa  And Eli hearing the noise and the cries said What is the reason of this outcry And the man came quickly and gave the news to Eli
Sa  Now Eli was ninetyeight years old and his eyes were fixed so that he was not able to see
Sa  And the man said to Eli I have come from the army and have come in flight today from the fight And he said How did it go my son
Sa  And the man said Israel went in flight from the Philistines and there has been great destruction among the people and your two sons Hophni and Phinehas are dead and the ark of God has been taken
Sa  And at these words about the ark of God Eli falling back off his seat by the side of the doorway into the town came down on the earth so that his neck was broken and death overtook him for he was an old man and of great weight He had been judging Israel for forty years
Sa  And his daughterinlaw the wife of Phinehas was with child and near the time when she would give birth and when she had the news that the ark of God had been taken and that her fatherinlaw and her husband were dead her pains came on her suddenly and she gave birth
Sa  And when she was very near death the women who were with her said Have no fear for you have given birth to a son But she made no answer and gave no attention to it
Sa  And she gave the child the name of Ichabod saying The glory has gone from Israel because the ark of God was taken and because of her fatherinlaw and her husband
Sa  And she said The glory is gone from Israel for the ark of God has been taken
Sa  Now the Philistines having taken the ark of God took it with them from Ebenezer to Ashdod
Sa  They took the ark of God into the house of Dagon and put it by the side of Dagon
Sa  And when the people of Ashdod got up early on the morning after they saw that Dagon had come down to the earth on his face before the ark of the Lord And they took Dagon up and put him in his place again
Sa  And when they got up early on the morning after Dagon had come down to the earth on his face before the ark of the Lord and his head and his hands were broken off on the doorstep only the base was in its place
Sa  So to this day no priest of Dagon or any who come into Dagons house will put his foot on the doorstep of the house of Dagon in Ashdod
Sa  But the hand of the Lord was hard on the people of Ashdod and he sent disease on them through all the country of Ashdod
Sa  And when the men of Ashdod saw how it was they said Let not the ark of the God of Israel be with us for his hand is hard on us and on Dagon our god
Sa  So they sent for all the lords of the Philistines to come together there and said What are we to do with the ark of the God of Israel And their answer was Let the ark of the God of Israel be taken away to Gath So they took the ark of the God of Israel away
Sa  But after they had taken it away the hand of the Lord was stretched out against the town for its destruction and the signs of disease came out on all the men of the town small and great
Sa  So they sent the ark of God to Ekron And when the ark of God came to Ekron the people of the town made an outcry saying They have sent the ark of the God of Israel to us for the destruction of us and of our people
Sa  So they sent and got together all the lords of the Philistines and they said Send away the ark of the God of Israel and let it go back to its place so that it may not be the cause of death to us and to our people for there was a great fear of death through all the town the hand of God was very hard on them there
Sa  And those men who were not overtaken by death were cruelly diseased and the cry of the town went up to heaven
Sa  Now the ark of the Lord was in the country of the Philistines for seven months
Sa  And the Philistines sent for the priests and those who were wise in secret arts and said to them What are we to do with the ark of the Lord How are we to send it away to its place
Sa  And they said If you send away the ark of the God of Israel do not send it without an offering but send him a sinoffering with it then you will have peace again and it will be clear to you why the weight of his hand has not been lifted from you
Sa  Then they said What sinoffering are we to send to him And they said Five gold images of the growths caused by your disease and five gold mice one for every lord of the Philistines for the same disease came on you and on your lords
Sa  So make images of the growths caused by your disease and of the mice which are damaging your land and give glory to the God of Israel it may be that the weight of his hand will be lifted from you and from your gods and from your land
Sa  Why do you make your hearts hard like the hearts of Pharaoh and the Egyptians When he had made sport of them did they not let the people go and they went away
Sa  So now take and make ready a new cart and two cows which have never come under the yoke and have the cows yoked to the cart and take their young ones away from them
Sa  And put the ark of the Lord on the cart and the gold images which you are sending as a sinoffering in a chest by its side and send it away so that it may go
Sa  If it goes by the land of Israel to Bethshemesh then this great evil is his work but if not then we may be certain that the evil was not his doing but was the working of chance
Sa  And the men did so they took two cows yoking them to the cart and shutting up their young ones in their livingplace
Sa  And they put the ark of the Lord on the cart and the chest with the gold images
Sa  And the cows took the straight way by the road to Bethshemesh they went by the highway not turning to the right or to the left and the sound of their voices was clear on the road and the lords of the Philistines went after them as far as the edge of Bethshemesh
Sa  And the people of Bethshemesh were cutting their grain in the valley and lifting up their eyes they saw the ark and were full of joy when they saw it
Sa  And the cart came into the field of Joshua the Bethshemite and came to a stop there by a great stone and cutting up the wood of the cart they made a burned offering of the cows to the Lord
Sa  Then the Levites took down the ark of the Lord and the chest in which were the gold images and put them on the great stone and the men of Bethshemesh made burned offerings and gave worship that day before the Lord
Sa  And the five lords of the Philistines having seen it went back to Ekron the same day
Sa  Now these are the gold images which the Philistines sent as a sinoffering to the Lord one for Ashdod one for Gaza one for Ashkelon one for Gath one for Ekron
Sa  And the gold mice one for every town of the Philistines the property of the five lords walled towns as well as country places and the great stone where they put the ark of the Lord is still in the field of Joshua the Bethshemite to this day
Sa  But the Lord sent destruction on seventy men of the people of Bethshemesh for looking into the ark of the Lord and great was the sorrow of the people for the destruction which the Lord had sent on them
Sa  And the men of Bethshemesh said Who is able to keep his place before the Lord this holy God and to whom may he go from us
Sa  And they sent men to the people living in Kiriathjearim saying The Philistines have sent back the ark of the Lord come and take it up to your country
Sa  So the men of Kiriathjearim came and took the ark of the Lord to the house of Abinadab in Gibeah and they made his son Eleazar holy and put the ark in his care
Sa  And the ark was in Kiriathjearim for a long time as much as twenty years and all Israel was searching after the Lord with weeping
Sa  Then Samuel said to all Israel If with all your hearts you would come back to the Lord then put away all the strange gods and the Astartes from among you and let your hearts be turned to the Lord and be servants to him only and he will make you safe from the hands of the Philistines
Sa  So the children of Israel gave up the worship of Baal and Astarte and became worshippers of the Lord only
Sa  Then Samuel said Let all Israel come to Mizpah and I will make prayer to the Lord for you
Sa  So they came together to Mizpah and got water draining it out before the Lord and they took no food that day and they said We have done evil against the Lord And Samuel was judge of the children of Israel in Mizpah
Sa  Now when the Philistines had news that the children of Israel had come together at Mizpah the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel And the children of Israel hearing of it were full of fear
Sa  And the children of Israel said to Samuel Go on crying to the Lord our God for us to make us safe from the hands of the Philistines
Sa  And Samuel took a young lamb offering all of it as a burned offering to the Lord and Samuel made prayers to the Lord for Israel and the Lord gave him an answer
Sa  And while Samuel was offering the burned offering the Philistines came near for the attack on Israel but at the thunder of the Lords voice that day the Philistines were overcome with fear and they gave way before Israel
Sa  And the men of Israel went out from Mizpah and went after the Philistines attacking them till they came under Bethcar
Sa  Then Samuel took a stone and put it up between Mizpah and Jeshanah naming it Ebenezer and saying Up to now the Lord has been our help
Sa  So the Philistines were overcome and did not come into the country of Israel again and all the days of Samuel the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines
Sa  And the towns which the Philistines had taken were given back to Israel from Ekron to Gath and all the country round them Israel made free from the power of the Philistines And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites
Sa  And Samuel was judge of Israel all the days of his life
Sa  From year to year he went in turn to Bethel and Gilgal and Mizpah judging Israel in all those places
Sa  And his base was at Ramah where his house was there he was judge of Israel and there he made an altar to the Lord
Sa  Now when Samuel was old he made his sons judges over Israel
Sa  The name of his first son was Joel and the name of his second Abijah they were judges in Beersheba
Sa  And his sons did not go in his ways but moved by the love of money took rewards and were not upright in judging
Sa  Then all the responsible men of Israel got together and went to Samuel at Ramah
Sa  And said to him See now you are old and your sons do not go in your ways give us a king now to be our judge so that we may be like the other nations
Sa  But Samuel was not pleased when they said to him Give us a king to be our judge And Samuel made prayer to the Lord
Sa  And the Lord said to Samuel Give ear to the voice of the people and what they say to you they have not been turned away from you but they have been turned away from me not desiring me to be king over them
Sa  As they have done from the first from the day when I took them out of Egypt till this day turning away from me and worshipping other gods so now they are acting in the same way to you
Sa  Give ear now to their voice but make a serious protest to them and give them a picture of the sort of king who will be their ruler
Sa  And Samuel said all these words of the Lord to the people who were desiring a king
Sa  And he said This is the sort of king who will be your ruler he will take your sons and make them his servants his horsemen and drivers of his warcarriages and they will go running before his warcarriages
Sa  And he will make them captains of thousands and of fifties some he will put to work ploughing and cutting his grain and making his instruments of war and building his warcarriages
Sa  Your daughters he will take to be makers of perfumes and cooks and breadmakers
Sa  He will take your fields and your vinegardens and your olivegardens all the best of them and give them to his servants
Sa  He will take a tenth of your seed and of the fruit of your vines and give it to his servants
Sa  He will take your menservants and your servantgirls and the best of your oxen and your asses and put them to his work
Sa  He will take a tenth of your sheep and you will be his servants
Sa  Then you will be crying out because of your king whom you have taken for yourselves but the Lord will not give you an answer in that day
Sa  But the people gave no attention to the voice of Samuel and they said No but we will have a king over us
Sa  So that we may be like the other nations and so that our king may be our judge and go out before us to war
Sa  Then Samuel after hearing all the people had to say went and gave an account of it to the Lord
Sa  And the Lord said to Samuel Give ear to their voice and make a king for them Then Samuel said to the men of Israel Let every man go back to his town
Sa  Now there was a man of Benjamin named Kish the son of Abiel the son of Zeror the son of Becorath the son of Aphiah a Benjamite a man of wealth
Sa  He had a son named Saul a specially goodlooking young man there was no one betterlooking among the children of Israel he was taller by a head than any other of the people
Sa  Now the asses of Sauls father Kish had gone wandering away And Kish said to his son Saul Take one of the servants with you and get up and go in search of the asses
Sa  So they went through the hillcountry of Ephraim and through the land of Shalishah but they saw no sign of them then they went through the land of Shaalim but they were not there and they went through the land of the Benjamites but they did not come across them
Sa  And when they had come to the land of Zuph Saul said to the servant who was with him Come let us go back or my father may give up caring about the asses and be troubled about us
Sa  But the servant said to him See now in this town there is a man of God who is highly honoured and everything he says comes true let us go there now it may be that he will give us directions about our journey
Sa  Then Saul said to his servant But if we go what are we to take the man all our bread is gone and we have no offering to take to the man of God what are we to do
Sa  But the servant said in answer I have here a fourth part of a shekel of silver I will give that to the man of God and he will give us directions about our way
Sa  In the past in Israel when a man went to get directions from God he said Come let us go to the Seer for he who now is named Prophet was in those days given the name of Seer
Sa  Then Saul said to his servant You have said well come let us go So they went to the town where the man of God was
Sa  And when they were on the way up to the town they saw some young girls going out to get water and said to them Is the seer here
Sa  And they said He is in fact he is before you go quickly now for he has come into the town today for the people are making an offering in the high place today
Sa  When you come into the town you will see him straight away before he goes up to the high place for the feast the people are waiting for his blessing before starting the feast and after that the guests will take part in it So go up now and you will see him
Sa  So they went up to the town and when they came inside the town Samuel came face to face with them on his way to the high place
Sa  Now the day before Saul came the word of God had come to Samuel saying
Sa  Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin and on him you are to put the holy oil making him ruler over my people Israel and he will make my people safe from the hands of the Philistines for I have seen the sorrow of my people whose cry has come up to me
Sa  And when Samuel saw Saul the Lord said to him This is the man of whom I gave you word he it is who is to have authority over my people
Sa  Then Saul came up to Samuel in the doorway of the town and said Give me directions if you will be so good to the house of the seer
Sa  Then Samuel said to Saul I am the seer go up before me to the high place and take food with me today and in the morning I will let you go after opening to you all the secrets of your heart
Sa  As for your asses which have been wandering for three days give no thought to them for they have come back And for whom are all the desired things in Israel are they not for you and your fathers family
Sa  And Saul said Am I not a man of Benjamin the smallest of all the tribes of Israel and my family the least of the families of Benjamin why then do you say these words to me
Sa  Then Samuel took Saul and his servant into the guest room and made them take the chief place among all the guests who were there about thirty persons
Sa  And Samuel said to the cook Give me that part which I gave you orders to keep by you
Sa  And the cook took up the leg with the fat tail on it and put it before Saul And Samuel said This is the part which has been kept for you take it as your part of the feast because it has been kept for you till the right time came and till the guests were present So that day Saul took food with Samuel
Sa  And when they had come down from the high place into the town where a bed was made ready for Saul he went to rest
Sa  And about dawn Samuel said to Saul on the roof Get up so that I may send you away So Saul got up and he and Samuel went out together
Sa  And on their way down to the end of the town Samuel said to Saul Give your servant orders to go on in front of us so he went on but you keep here so that I may give you the word of God
Sa  Then Samuel took the bottle of oil and put the oil on his head and gave him a kiss and said Is not the Lord with the holy oil making you ruler over Israel his people and you will have authority over the people of the Lord and you will make them safe from the hands of their attackers round about them and this will be the sign for you
Sa  When you have gone away from me today you will see two men by the restingplace of Rachels body in the land of Benjamin at Zelzah and they will say to you The asses which you went in search of have come back and now your father caring no longer for the asses is troubled about you saying What am I to do about my son
Sa  Then you are to go on from there and when you come to the oaktree of Tabor you will see three men going up to God to Bethel one having with him three young goats and another three cakes of bread and another a skin full of wine
Sa  They will say Peace be with you and will give you two cakes of bread which you are to take from them
Sa  After that you will come to Gibeah the hill of God where an armed force of the Philistines is stationed and when you come to the town you will see a band of prophets coming down from the high place with instruments of music before them and they will be acting like prophets
Sa  And the spirit of the Lord will come on you with power and you will be acting like a prophet with them and will be changed into another man
Sa  And when these signs come to you see that you take the chance which is offered you for God is with you
Sa  Then you are to go down before me to Gilgal where I will come to you for the offering of burned offerings and peaceofferings go on waiting there for seven days till I come to you and make clear to you what you have to do
Sa  And it came about that when he went away from Samuel God gave him a changed heart and all those signs took place that day
Sa  And when they came to Gibeah a band of prophets came face to face with him and the spirit of God came on him with power and he took his place among them as a prophet
Sa  Now when Sauls old friends saw him among the band of prophets the people said to one another What has come to Saul the son of Kish Is even Saul among the prophets
Sa  And one of the people of that place said in answer And who is their father So it became a common saying Is even Saul among the prophets
Sa  Then going away from the prophets he came to the house
Sa  And Sauls fathers brother said to him and his servant Where have you been And he said Searching for the asses and when we saw no sign of them we came to Samuel
Sa  Then he said And what did Samuel say to you
Sa  And Saul answering him said He gave us word that the asses had come back But he said nothing to him of Samuels words about the kingdom
Sa  Then Samuel sent for the people to come together before the Lord at Mizpah
Sa  And he said to the children of Israel The Lord the God of Israel has said I took Israel out of Egypt and made you free from the hands of the Egyptians and from all the kingdoms which kept you down
Sa  But today you are turned away from your God who himself has been your saviour from all your troubles and sorrows and you have said to him Put a king over us So now take your places before the Lord by your tribes and by your thousands
Sa  So Samuel made all the tribes of Israel come near and the tribe of Benjamin was taken
Sa  Then he made the tribe of Benjamin come near by families and the family of the Matrites was taken and from them Saul the son of Kish was taken but when they went in search of him he was nowhere to be seen
Sa  So they put another question to the Lord Is the man present here And the answer of the Lord was He is keeping himself from view among the goods
Sa  So they went quickly and made him come out and when he took his place among the people he was taller by a head than any of the people
Sa  And Samuel said to all the people Do you see the man of the Lords selection how there is no other like him among all the people And all the people with loud cries said Long life to the king
Sa  Then Samuel gave the people the laws of the kingdom writing them in a book which he put in a safe place before the Lord And Samuel sent all the people away every man to his house
Sa  And Saul went to Gibeah to his house and with him went the men of war whose hearts had been touched by God
Sa  But certain goodfornothing persons said How is this man to be our saviour And having no respect for him they gave him no offering
Sa  Then about a month after this Nahash the Ammonite came up and put his forces in position for attacking Jabeshgilead and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash Make an agreement with us and we will be your servants
Sa  And Nahash the Ammonite said to them I will make an agreement with you on this condition that all your right eyes are put out so that I may make it a cause of shame to all Israel
Sa  Then the responsible men of Jabesh said to him Give us seven days so that we may send men to every part of Israel and then if no one comes to our help we will come out to you
Sa  So they sent representatives to Sauls town Gibeah and these gave the news to the people and all the people gave themselves to weeping
Sa  Now Saul came from the field driving the oxen before him and he said Why are the people weeping And they gave him word of what the men of Jabesh had said
Sa  And at their words the spirit of God came on Saul with power and he became very angry
Sa  And he took two oxen and cutting them up sent them through all the land of Israel by the hand of runners saying If any man does not come out after Saul and Samuel this will be done to his oxen And the fear of the Lord came on the people and they came out like one man
Sa  And he had them numbered in Bezek the children of Israel were three hundred thousand and the men of Judah thirty thousand
Sa  Then he said to the representatives who had come Say to the men of Jabeshgilead Tomorrow by the time the sun is high you will be made safe And the representatives came and gave the news to the men of Jabesh and they were glad
Sa  So the men of Jabesh said Tomorrow we will come out to you and you may do to us whatever seems good to you
Sa  Now on the day after Saul put the people into three bands and in the morning watch they came to the tents of the Ammonites and they went on attacking them till the heat of the day and those who were not put to death were put to flight in every direction so that no two of them were together
Sa  And the people said to Samuel Who was it who said Is Saul to be our king give the men up so that we may put them to death
Sa  And Saul said Not a man is to be put to death today for today the Lord has made Israel safe
Sa  Then Samuel said to the people Come let us go to Gilgal and there make the kingdom strong in the hands of Saul
Sa  So all the people went to Gilgal and there in Gilgal they made Saul king before the Lord and peaceofferings were offered before the Lord and there Saul and all the men of Israel were glad with great joy
Sa  And Samuel said to all Israel You see that I have given ear to everything you said to me and have made a king over you
Sa  And now see the king is before you and I am old and greyheaded and my sons are with you I have been living before your eyes from my early days till now
Sa  Here I am give witness against me before the Lord and before the man on whom he has put the holy oil whose ox or ass have I taken to whom have I been untrue who has been crushed down by me from whose hand have I taken a price for the blinding of my eyes I will give it all back to you
Sa  And they said You have never been untrue to us or cruel to us you have taken nothing from any man
Sa  Then he said The Lord is witness against you and the man on whom he has put the holy oil is witness this day that you have seen no wrong in me And they said He is witness
Sa  And Samuel said to the people The Lord is witness who gave authority to Moses and Aaron and who took your fathers up out of the land of Egypt
Sa  Keep your places now while I take up the argument with you before the Lord and give you the story of the righteousness of the Lord which he has made clear by his acts to you and to your fathers
Sa  When Jacob and his sons had come into Egypt and were crushed by the Egyptians the prayers of your fathers came up to the Lord and the Lord sent Moses and Aaron who took your fathers out of Egypt and he put them into this place
Sa  But they were false to the Lord their God and he gave them up into the hands of Sisera captain of the army of Jabin king of Hazor and into the hands of the Philistines and into the hands of the king of Moab who made war against them
Sa  Then crying out to the Lord they said We have done evil because we have been turned away from the Lord worshipping the Baals and the Astartes but now make us safe from those who are against us and we will be your servants
Sa  So the Lord sent Jerubbaal and Barak and Jephthah and Samuel and took you out of the power of those who were fighting against you on every side and made you safe
Sa  And when you saw that Nahash the king of the Ammonites was coming against you you said to me No more of this we will have a king for our ruler when the Lord your God was your king
Sa  Here then is the king marked out by you the Lord has put a king over you
Sa  If in the fear of the Lord you are his servants hearing his voice and not going against the orders of the Lord but being true to the Lord your God you and the king ruling over you then all will be well
Sa  But if you do not give ear to the voice of the Lord but go against his orders then the hand of the Lord will be against you and against your king for your destruction as it was against your fathers
Sa  Now keep where you are and see this great thing which the Lord will do before your eyes
Sa  Is it not now the time of the grain cutting My cry will go up to the Lord and he will send thunder and rain so that you may see and be conscious of your great sin which you have done in the eyes of the Lord in desiring a king for yourselves
Sa  So Samuel made prayer to the Lord and the Lord sent thunder and rain that day and all the people were in fear of the Lord and of Samuel
Sa  And all the people said to Samuel Make prayer for us to the Lord your God so that death may not overtake us for in addition to all our sins we have done this evil in desiring a king
Sa  Then Samuel said to the people Have no fear truly you have done evil but do not be turned away from the Lord be his servants with all your heart
Sa  And do not go from the right way turning to those false gods in which there is no profit and no salvation for they are false
Sa  For the Lord will not give his people up because of the honour of his name for it was the Lords pleasure to make of you a people for himself
Sa  And as for me never will I go against the orders of the Lord by giving up my prayers for you but I will go on teaching you the good and right way
Sa  Only go in the fear of the Lord and be his true servants with all your heart keeping in mind what great things he has done for you
Sa  But if you still do evil destruction will overtake you and your king
Sa  
Sa  And Saul took for himself three thousand men of Israel of whom he kept two thousand with him in Michmash and in the mountain of Bethel and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah in the land of Benjamin the rest of the people he sent back to their tents
Sa  And Jonathan made an attack on the armed force of the Philistines stationed at Gibeah and news was given to the Philistines that the Hebrews were turned against them And Saul had a horn sounded through all the land
Sa  And all Israel had the news that Saul had made an attack on the Philistines and that Israel was bitterly hated by the Philistines And the people came together after Saul to Gilgal
Sa  And the Philistines came together to make war on Israel three thousand warcarriages and six thousand horsemen and an army of people like the sands of the sea in number they came up and took up their position in Michmash to the east of Bethaven
Sa  When the men of Israel saw the danger they were in for the people were troubled they took cover in cracks in the hillsides and in the woods and in rocks and holes and hollows
Sa  And a great number of the people had gone over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead but Saul was still in Gilgal and all the people went after him shaking in fear
Sa  And he went on waiting there for seven days the time fixed by Samuel but Samuel did not come to Gilgal and the people were starting to go away from him
Sa  Then Saul said Come here and give me the burned offering and the peaceofferings And he made a burned offering to the Lord
Sa  And when the burned offering was ended Samuel came and Saul went out to see him and to give him a blessing
Sa  And Samuel said What have you done And Saul said Because I saw that the people were going away from me and you had not come at the time which had been fixed and the Philistines had come together at Michmash
Sa  I said Now the Philistines will come down on me at Gilgal and I have made no prayer for help to the Lord and so forcing myself to do it I made a burned offering
Sa  And Samuel said to Saul You have done a foolish thing you have not kept the rules which the Lord your God gave you it was the purpose of the Lord to make your authority over Israel safe for ever
Sa  But now your authority will not go on the Lord searching for a man who is pleasing to him in every way has given him the place of ruler over his people because you have not done what the Lord gave you orders to do
Sa  Then Samuel went up from Gilgal and the rest of the people went up after Saul against the men of war and they came from Gilgal to Gibeah in the land of Benjamin and Saul took the number of the people who were with him about six hundred men
Sa  And Saul with Jonathan his son and the people who were with them was waiting in Geba in the land of Benjamin but the tents of the Philistines were in Michmash
Sa  And three bands of men came out from the Philistines to make an attack one band went by the road which goes to Ophrah into the land of Shual
Sa  And another went in the direction of Bethhoron and another went by the hill looking down on the valley of Zeboiim in the direction of the waste land
Sa  Now there was no ironworker in all the land of Israel for the Philistines said For fear the Hebrews make themselves swords or spears
Sa  But all the Israelites had to go to the Philistines to get their ploughs and blades and axes and hooks made sharp
Sa  For they had instruments for putting an edge on their ploughs and blades and forks and axes and for putting iron points on their oxdriving rods
Sa  So on the day of the fight at Michmash not a sword or a spear was to be seen in the hands of any of the people with Saul and Jonathan only Saul and his son Jonathan had them
Sa  And the armed force of the Philistines went out to the narrow way of Michmash
Sa  Now one day Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who was with him looking after his arms Come let us go over to the Philistine force over there But he said nothing to his father
Sa  And Saul was still waiting in the farthest part of Geba under the fruittree in Migron there were about six hundred men with him
Sa  And Ahijah the son of Ahitub brother of Ichabod the son of Phinehas the son of Eli the priest of the Lord in Shiloh who had the ephod And the people had no idea that Jonathan had gone
Sa  Now between the narrow roads over the mountains by which Jonathan was making his way to the Philistines forces there was a sharp overhanging rock on one side and a sharp rock on the other side one was named Bozez and the other Seneh
Sa  The one rock went up on the north in front of Michmash and the other on the south in front of Geba
Sa  And Jonathan said to his young servant who had his arms Come let us go over to the armies of these men who have no circumcision it may be that the Lord will give us help for there is no limit to his power the Lord is able to give salvation by a great army or by a small band
Sa  And his servant said to him Do whatever is in your mind see I am with you in every impulse of your heart
Sa  Then Jonathan said Now we will go over to these men and let them see us
Sa  If they say to us Keep quiet where you are till we come to you then we will keep our places and not go up to them
Sa  But if they say Come up to us then we will go up for the Lord has given them into our hands and this will be the sign to us
Sa  And they let the Philistine force see the two of them and the Philistines said Look the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have taken cover
Sa  And the armed men of the force gave Jonathan and his servant their answer saying Come up here to us and we will let you see something Then Jonathan said to his servant Come up after me for the Lord has given them up into the hands of Israel
Sa  And Jonathan went up gripping with his hands and his feet his servant going up after him and the Philistines gave way before Jonathan when he made an attack on them and his servant put them to death after him
Sa  And at their first attack Jonathan and his servant put to the sword about twenty men all inside the space of half an acre of land
Sa  And there was great fear in the tents and in the field and among all the men of the armed force and the attackers were shaking with fear even the earth was moved with a great shaking and there was a fear as from God
Sa  And the watchmen of Saul looking out from Geba in the land of Benjamin saw all the army flowing away and running here and there
Sa  Then Saul said to the people who were with him Let everyone be numbered and let us see who has gone from us And when they had been numbered it was seen that Jonathan and his servant were not there
Sa  And Saul said to Ahijah Let the ephod come here For he went before Israel with the ephod at that time
Sa  Now while Saul was talking to the priest the noise in the tents of the Philistines became louder and louder and Saul said to the priest Take back your hand
Sa  And Saul and all the people with him came together and went forward to the fight and every mans sword was turned against the man at his side and there was a very great noise
Sa  Then the Hebrews who had been with the Philistines for some time and had gone up with them to their tents turning round were joined to those who were with Saul and Jonathan
Sa  And all the men of Israel who had taken cover in the hillcountry of Ephraim hearing that the Philistines had been put to flight went after them attacking them
Sa  So the Lord made Israel safe that day and the fight went over to Bethaven
Sa  And all the people were with Saul about twenty thousand men and the fight was general through all the hillcountry of Ephraim but Saul made a great error that day by putting the people under an oath saying Let that man be cursed who takes food before evening comes and I have given punishment to those who are against me So the people had not a taste of food
Sa  And there was honey on the face of the field and all the people came to the honey the bees having gone from it
Sa  But not a man put his hand to his mouth for fear of the curse
Sa  But Jonathan having no knowledge of the oath his father had put on the people stretching out the rod which was in his hand put the end of it in the honey and put it to his mouth then his eyes were made bright
Sa  Then one of the people said to him Your father put the people under an oath saying Let that man be cursed who takes any food this day And the people were feeble needing food
Sa  Then Jonathan said My father has made trouble come on the land now see how bright my eyes have become because I have taken a little of this honey
Sa  How much more if the people had freely taken their food from the goods of those who were fighting against them would there not have been much greater destruction among the Philistines
Sa  That day they overcame the Philistines from Michmash to Aijalon and the people were feeble from need of food
Sa  And rushing at the goods taken in the fight the people took oxen and sheep and young oxen and put them to death there on the earth and had a meal taking the flesh with the blood in it
Sa  Then it was said to Saul See the people are sinning against the Lord taking the blood with the flesh And he said to those who gave him the news Now let a great stone be rolled to me here
Sa  And Saul said Go about among the people and say to them Let every man come here to me with his ox and his sheep and put them to death here and take his meal do no sin against the Lord by taking the blood with the flesh So all the people took their oxen with them that night and put them to death there
Sa  And Saul put up an altar to the Lord this was the first altar which he put up to the Lord
Sa  And Saul said Let us go down after the Philistines by night attacking them till the morning till there is not a man of them living And they said Do whatever seems right to you Then the priest said Let us come near to God
Sa  And Saul desiring directions from God said Am I to go down after the Philistines will you give them up into the hands of Israel But he gave him no answer that day
Sa  And Saul said Come near all you chiefs of the people and let us get word from God and see in whom is this sin today
Sa  For by the living Lord the saviour of Israel even if the sinner is Jonathan my son death will certainly be his fate But not a man among all the people gave him any answer
Sa  Then he said to all Israel You be on one side and I with Jonathan my son will be on the other side And the people said to Saul Do whatever seems good to you
Sa  Then Saul said to the Lord the God of Israel Why have you not given me an answer today If the sin is in me or in Jonathan my son O Lord God of Israel give Urim and if it is in your people Israel give Thummim And by the decision of the Lord Saul and Jonathan were marked out and the people went free
Sa  And Saul said Give your decision between my son Jonathan and me And Jonathan was taken
Sa  Then Saul said to Jonathan Give me an account of what you have done And Jonathan gave him the story and said Certainly I took a little honey on the end of my rod and now death is to be my fate
Sa  And Saul said May Gods punishment be on me if death is not your fate Jonathan
Sa  And the people said to Saul Is death to come to Jonathan the worker of this great salvation for Israel Let it not be so by the living Lord not one hair of his head is to be touched for he has been working with God today So the people kept Jonathan from death
Sa  Then Saul turning back went after the Philistines no longer and the Philistines went back to their place
Sa  Now when Saul had taken his place as ruler of Israel he made war on those who were against him on every side Moab and the Ammonites and Edom and the kings of Zobah and the Philistines and whichever way he went he overcame them
Sa  And he did great things and overcame the Amalekites and made Israel safe from the hands of their attackers
Sa  Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan and Ishvi and Malchishua and these are the names of his daughters the older was named Merab and the younger Michal
Sa  The name of Sauls wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz the captain of his army was Abner the son of Ner brother of Sauls father
Sa  Kish the father of Saul and Ner the father of Abner were sons of Abiel
Sa  All through the life of Saul there was bitter war against the Philistines and whenever Saul saw any strong man or any good fighting man he kept him near himself
Sa  And Samuel said to Saul The Lord sent me to put the holy oil on you and to make you king over his people over Israel so give ear now to the words of the Lord
Sa  The Lord of armies says I will give punishment to Amalek for what he did to Israel fighting against him on the way when Israel came out of Egypt
Sa  Go now and put Amalek to the sword putting to the curse all they have without mercy put to death every man and woman every child and baby at the breast every ox and sheep camel and ass
Sa  And Saul sent for the people and had them numbered in Telaim two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of Judah
Sa  And Saul came to the town of Amalek and took up his position in the valley secretly
Sa  And Saul said to the Kenites Go away take yourselves out from among the Amalekites or destruction will overtake you with them for you were kind to the children of Israel when they came out of Egypt So the Kenites went away from among the Amalekites
Sa  And Saul made an attack on the Amalekites from Havilah on the road to Shur which is before Egypt
Sa  He took Agag king of the Amalekites prisoner and put all the people to the sword without mercy
Sa  But Saul and the people did not put Agag to death and they kept the best of the sheep and the oxen and the fat beasts and the lambs and whatever was good not desiring to put them to the curse but everything which was bad and of no use they put to the curse
Sa  Then the Lord said to Samuel
Sa  It is no longer my pleasure for Saul to be king for he is turned back from going in my ways and has not done my orders And Samuel was very sad crying to the Lord in prayer all night
Sa  And early in the morning he got up and went to Saul and word was given to Samuel that Saul had come to Carmel and put up a pillar and had gone from there down to Gilgal
Sa  And Samuel came to Saul and Saul said to him May the blessing of the Lord be with you I have done what was ordered by the Lord
Sa  And Samuel said What then is this sound of the crying of sheep and the noise of oxen which comes to my ears
Sa  And Saul said They have taken them from the Amalekites for the people have kept the best of the sheep and of the oxen as an offering to the Lord your God all the rest we have given up to destruction
Sa  Then Samuel said to Saul Say no more Let me give you word of what the Lord has said to me this night And he said to him Say on
Sa  And Samuel said Though you may seem little to yourself are you not head of the tribes of Israel for the Lord with the holy oil made you king over Israel
Sa  And the Lord sent you on a journey and said Go and put to the curse those sinners the Amalekites fighting against them till every one is dead
Sa  Why then did you not do the orders of the Lord but by violently taking their goods did evil in the eyes of the Lord
Sa  And Saul said Truly I have done the orders of the Lord and have gone the way the Lord sent me I have taken Agag the king of Amalek and have given the Amalekites up to destruction
Sa  But the people took some of their goods sheep and oxen the chief of the things which were put to the curse to make an offering of them to the Lord your God in Gilgal
Sa  And Samuel said Has the Lord as much delight in offerings and burned offerings as in the doing of his orders Truly to do his pleasure is better than to make offerings and to give ear to him than the fat of sheep
Sa  For to go against his orders is like the sin of those who make use of secret arts and pride is like giving worship to images Because you have put away from you the word of the Lord he has put you from your place as king
Sa  And Saul said to Samuel Great is my sin for I have gone against the orders of the Lord and against your words because fearing the people I did what they said
Sa  So now let my sin have forgiveness and go back with me to give worship to the Lord
Sa  And Samuel said to Saul I will not go back with you for you have put away from you the word of the Lord and the Lord has put you from your place as king over Israel
Sa  And when Samuel was turning round to go away Saul took the skirt of his robe in his hand and the cloth came away
Sa  And Samuel said to him The Lord has taken away the kingdom of Israel from you this day by force and has given it to a neighbour of yours who is better than you
Sa  And further the Glory of Israel will not say what is false and his purpose may not be changed for he is not a man whose purpose may be changed
Sa  Then he said Great is my sin but still give me honour now before the heads of my people and before Israel and come back with me so that I may give worship to the Lord your God
Sa  So Samuel went back after Saul and Saul gave worship to the Lord
Sa  Then Samuel said Make Agag the king of the Amalekites come here to me And Agag came to him shaking with fear And Agag said Truly the pain of death is past
Sa  And Samuel said As your sword has made women without children so now your mother will be without children among women And Agag was cut up by Samuel bone from bone before the Lord in Gilgal
Sa  Then Samuel went to Ramah and Saul went up to his house in Gibeah in the land of Saul
Sa  And Samuel never saw Saul again till the day of his death but Samuel was sorrowing for Saul and it was no longer the Lords pleasure for Saul to be king over Israel
Sa  And the Lord said to Samuel How long will you go on sorrowing for Saul seeing that I have put him from his place as king over Israel Take oil in your vessel and go I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite for I have got a king for myself among his sons
Sa  And Samuel said How is it possible for me to go If Saul gets news of it he will put me to death And the Lord said Take a young cow with you and say I have come to make an offering to the Lord
Sa  And send for Jesse to be present at the offering and I will make clear to you what you are to do and you are to put the holy oil on him whose name I give you
Sa  And Samuel did as the Lord said and came to Bethlehem And the responsible men of the town came out to him in fear and said Do you come in peace
Sa  And he said In peace I have come to make an offering to the Lord make yourselves clean and come with me to make the offering And he made Jesse and his sons clean and sent for them to be present at the offering
Sa  Now when they came looking at Eliab he said Clearly the man of the Lords selection is before him
Sa  But the Lord said to Samuel Do not take note of his face or how tall he is because I will not have him for the Lords view is not mans man takes note of the outer form but the Lord sees the heart
Sa  Then Jesse sent for Abinadab and made him come before Samuel And he said The Lord has not taken this one
Sa  Then Jesse made Shammah come before him And he said The Lord has not taken this one
Sa  And Jesse made his seven sons come before Samuel And Samuel said to Jesse The Lord has not taken any of these
Sa  Then Samuel said to Jesse Are all your children here And he said There is still the youngest and he is looking after the sheep And Samuel said to Jesse Send and make him come here for we will not take our seats till he is here
Sa  So he sent and made him come in Now he had red hair and beautiful eyes and pleasing looks And the Lord said Come put the oil on him for this is he
Sa  Then Samuel took the bottle of oil and put the oil on him there among his brothers and from that day the spirit of the Lord came on David with power So Samuel went back to Ramah
Sa  Now the spirit of the Lord had gone from Saul and an evil spirit from the Lord was troubling him
Sa  And Sauls servants said to him See now an evil spirit from God is troubling you
Sa  Now give orders to your servants who are here before you to go in search of a man who is an expert player on a corded instrument and it will be that when the evil spirit from God is on you he will make music for you on his instrument and you will get well
Sa  And Saul said to his servants Then get me a man who is an expert player and make him come to me
Sa  Then one of the servants in answer said I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is expert at playing and a strong man and a man of war and he is wise in his words and pleasing in looks and the Lord is with him
Sa  So Saul sent his servants to Jesse and said Send me your son David who is with the sheep
Sa  And Jesse took five cakes of bread and a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them to Saul by David
Sa  And David came to Saul waiting before him and he became very dear to Saul who made him his servant giving him the care of his arms
Sa  And Saul sent to Jesse saying Let David be with me for he is pleasing to me
Sa  And whenever the evil spirit from God came on Saul David took his instrument and made music so new life came to Saul and he got well and the evil spirit went away from him
Sa  Now the Philistines got their armies together for war and came together at Socoh in the land of Judah and took up their position between Socoh and Azekah in Ephesdammim
Sa  And Saul and the men of Israel came together and took up their position in the valley of Elah and put their forces in order against the Philistines
Sa  The Philistines were stationed on the mountain on one side and Israel on the mountain on the other side and there was a valley between them
Sa  And a fighter came out from the tents of the Philistines named Goliath of Gath he was more than six cubits tall
Sa  And he had a headdress of brass on his head and he was dressed in a coat of metal the weight of which was five thousand shekels of brass
Sa  His legs were covered with plates of brass and hanging on his back was a javelin of brass
Sa  The stem of his spear was as long as a clothworkers rod and its head was made of six hundred shekels weight of iron and one went before him with his bodycover
Sa  He took up his position and in a loud voice said to the armies of Israel Why have you come out to make war Am I not a Philistine and you servants of Saul Send out a man for yourselves and let him come down to me
Sa  If he is able to have a fight with me and overcome me then we will be your servants but if I am able to overcome him then you will be our servants and do work for us
Sa  And the Philistine said I have put to shame the armies of Israel this day give me a man so that we may have a fight together
Sa  And Saul and all Israel hearing those words of the Philistine were troubled and full of fear
Sa  Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah named Jesse who had eight sons and he was an old man in Sauls day and far on in years
Sa  And the three oldest sons of Jesse had gone with Saul to the fight the names of the three who went to the fight were Eliab the oldest and Abinadab the second and Shammah the third
Sa  And David was the youngest and the three oldest were with Sauls army
Sa  Now David went to and from Saul looking after his fathers sheep at Bethlehem
Sa  And the Philistine came near every morning and evening for forty days
Sa  And Jesse said to his son David Take now for your brothers an ephah of this dry grain and these ten cakes of bread and go quickly with them to the tents to your brothers
Sa  And take these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand and see how your brothers are and come back with a sign to say how they are
Sa  Now Saul and they and all the men of Israel were in the valley of Elah fighting with the Philistines
Sa  And David got up early in the morning and giving the sheep into the care of a keeper took the things and went as Jesse had said and he came to the lines where the carts were when the army was going out to the fight giving their warcry
Sa  And Israel and the Philistines had put their forces in position army against army
Sa  And David gave his parcels into the hands of the keeper of the army stores and went running to the army and came to his brothers to get knowledge about them
Sa  And while he was talking to them the fighter the Philistine of Gath Goliath by name came out from the Philistines lines and said the same words in Davids hearing
Sa  And all the men of Israel when they saw him went in flight overcome with fear
Sa  And the men of Israel said Have you seen this man Clearly he has come out to put shame on Israel and it is certain that if any man overcomes him the king will give that man great wealth and will give him his daughter and make his fathers family free in Israel
Sa  And David said to the men near him What will be done to the man who overcomes this Philistine and takes away the shame from Israel for who is this Philistine a man without circumcision that he has put shame on the armies of the living God
Sa  And the people gave him this answer So it will be done to the man who overcomes him
Sa  And Eliab his oldest brother hearing what David said to the men was moved to wrath against David and said Why have you come here Into whose care have you given that little flock of sheep in the waste land I have knowledge of your pride and the evil of your heart you have come down to see the fight
Sa  And David said What have I done now was it not only a word
Sa  And turning away from him to one of the other men he said the same words and the people gave him the same answer
Sa  And hearing what David said they gave Saul word of it and he sent for him
Sa  And David said to Saul Let no mans heart become feeble because of him I your servant will go out and have a fight with this Philistine
Sa  And Saul said to David You are not able to go out against this Philistine and have a fight with him for you are only a boy and he has been a man of war from his earliest days
Sa  And David said to Saul Your servant has been keeper of his fathers sheep and if a lion or a bear came and took a lamb from the flock
Sa  I went out after him and overcame him and took it out of his mouth and if turning on me he came at me I took him by the hair and overcame him and put him to death
Sa  Your servant has overcome lion and bear and the fate of this Philistine who is without circumcision will be like theirs seeing that he has put shame on the armies of the living God
Sa  And David said The Lord who kept me safe from the grip of the lion and the bear will be my saviour from the hands of this Philistine And Saul said to David Go and may the Lord be with you
Sa  Then Saul gave David his clothing of war and put a headdress of brass on his head and had him clothed with a coat of metal
Sa  And David took Sauls sword and put the band round him over the metal coat and was unable to go forward for he was not used to them Then David said to Saul It is not possible for me to go out with these for I am not used to them So David took them off
Sa  Then he took his stick in his hand and got five smooth stones from the bed of the stream and put them in a bag such as is used by sheepkeepers and in his hand was a leather band used for sending stones and so he went in the direction of the Philistine
Sa  And the Philistine came nearer to David and the man who had his bodycover went before him
Sa  And when the Philistine taking note saw David he had a poor opinion of him for he was only a boy redhaired and goodlooking
Sa  And the Philistine said to David Am I a dog that you come out to me with sticks And the Philistine put curses on David by all his gods
Sa  And the Philistine said to David Come here to me and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field
Sa  Then David said to the Philistine You come to me with a sword and a spear and a javelin but I come to you in the name of the Lord of armies the God of the armies of Israel on which you have put shame
Sa  This day the Lord will give you up into my hands and I will overcome you and take your head off you and I will give the bodies of the Philistine army to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth today so that all the earth may see that Israel has a God
Sa  And all these people who are here today may see that the Lord does not give salvation by sword and spear for the fight is the Lords and he will give you up into our hands
Sa  Now when the Philistine made a move and came near to David David quickly went at a run in the direction of the army meeting the Philistine face to face
Sa  And David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone and sent it from his leather band straight at the Philistine and the stone went deep into his brow and he went down to the earth falling on his face
Sa  So David overcame the Philistine with his leather band and a stone wounding the Philistine and causing his death but David had no sword in his hand
Sa  So running up to the Philistine and putting his foot on him David took his sword out of its cover and put him to death cutting off his head with it And when the Philistines saw that their fighter was dead they went in flight
Sa  And the men of Israel and of Judah got up and gave a cry and went after the Philistines as far as Gath and the town doors of Ekron And the wounded of the Philistines were falling down by the road from Shaaraim all the way to Gath and Ekron
Sa  Then the children of Israel came back from going after the Philistines and took their goods from the tents
Sa  And David took the head of the Philistine to Jerusalem but the metal wardress and the arms he put in his tent
Sa  And when Saul saw David going out against the Philistine he said to Abner the captain of the army Abner whose son is this young man And Abner said On your life O king I have no idea
Sa  And the king said Make search and see whose son this young man is
Sa  And when David was coming back after the destruction of the Philistine Abner took him to Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand
Sa  And Saul said to him Young man whose son are you And David in answer said I am the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem
Sa  Now after Davids talk with Saul was ended the soul of Jonathan was joined with the soul of David and David became as dear to him as his very life
Sa  And that day Saul took David and would not let him go back to his fathers house
Sa  Then Jonathan and David made an agreement together because of Jonathans love for David
Sa  And Jonathan took off the robe he had on and gave it to David with all his military dress even to his sword and his bow and the band round his body
Sa  And David went wherever Saul sent him and did wisely and Saul put him at the head of his men of war and this was pleasing to all the people as well as to Sauls servants
Sa  Now on their way when David came back after the destruction of the Philistine the women came out of all the towns of Israel with songs and dances meeting David with melody and joy and instruments of music
Sa  And the women answering one another in their song said Saul has put to death his thousands and David his tens of thousands
Sa  And Saul was very angry and this saying was unpleasing to him and he said They have given David credit for tens of thousands and to me for only thousands what more is there for him but the kingdom
Sa  And from that day Saul was looking with envy on David
Sa  Now on the day after an evil spirit from God came on Saul with great force and he was acting like a prophet among the men of his house while David was making music for him as he did day by day and Saul had his spear in his hand
Sa  And Saul balancing the spear in his hand said I will give David a blow pinning him to the wall And David got away from him twice
Sa  And Saul went in fear of David because the Lord was with David and had gone away from Saul
Sa  So Saul sent him away and made him a captain over a thousand and he went about his business before the people
Sa  And in all his undertakings David did wisely and the Lord was with him
Sa  And when Saul saw how wisely he did he was in fear of him
Sa  But David was loved by all Israel and Judah for he went out and came in before them
Sa  And Saul said to David Here is my oldest daughter Merab whom I will give you for your wife only be strong for me fighting in the Lords wars For Saul said Let it not be through me that his fate comes to him but through the Philistines
Sa  And David said to Saul Who am I and what is my fathers family in Israel that I am to be soninlaw to the king
Sa  But when the time came to give Merab Sauls daughter to David she was given to Adriel of Meholath
Sa  And Sauls daughter Michal was in love with David and Saul had word of it and was pleased
Sa  And Saul said I will give her to him so that she may be a cause of danger to him and so that the hands of the Philistines may be against him So Saul said to David Today you are to become my soninlaw for the second time
Sa  And Saul gave his servants orders saying Have talk with David secretly and say to him See how the king has delight in you and how you are loved by all his servants then be the kings soninlaw
Sa  And Sauls servants said these things to David And David said Does it seem to you a small thing to be the kings soninlaw seeing that I am a poor man of no great name
Sa  And the servants of Saul gave him an account of what David had said
Sa  And Saul said Then say to David The king has no desire for any brideprice but only for the private parts of a hundred Philistines so that the king may get the better of his haters But it was in Sauls mind that David might come to his end by the hands of the Philistines
Sa  And when his servants said these words to David he was well pleased to be the soninlaw of the king And the days were still not past
Sa  So David and his men got up and went and put to death two hundred of the Philistines and David took their private parts and gave the full number of them to the king so that he might be the kings soninlaw And Saul gave him his daughter Michal for his wife
Sa  And it was clear to Saul that the Lord was with David and he was loved by all Israel
Sa  And Sauls fear of David became all the greater and he went on hating him day by day
Sa  Then the rulers of the Philistines went out to war and whenever they went out David did more wisely than all the other servants of Saul so that his name became greatly honoured
Sa  And Saul gave orders to his son Jonathan and to all his servants to put David to death But Sauls son Jonathan had great delight in David
Sa  And Jonathan said to David Saul my father is purposing your death so now take care in the morning and keep yourself safe in a secret place
Sa  And I will go out and take my place by my fathers side in the field near where you are and I will get into talk with my father about you and when I see how things are I will give you word
Sa  And Jonathan gave his father Saul a good account of David and said to him Let not the king do wrong against his servant against David because he has done you no wrong and all his acts have had a good outcome for you
Sa  For he put his life in danger and overcame the Philistine and the Lord gave all Israel salvation you saw it and were glad why then are you sinning against him who has done no wrong desiring the death of David without cause
Sa  And Saul gave ear to the voice of Jonathan and said with an oath By the living Lord he is not to be put to death
Sa  Then Jonathan sent for David and gave him word of all these things And Jonathan took David to Saul who kept him by his side as in the past
Sa  And there was war again and David went out fighting the Philistines causing great destruction among them and they went in flight before him
Sa  And an evil spirit from the Lord came on Saul when he was seated in his house with his spear in his hand and David made music for him
Sa  And Saul would have sent his spear through him pinning him to the wall but he got away and the spear went into the wall and that night David went in flight and got away
Sa  Then in that night Saul sent men to Davids house to keep watch on him so as to put him to death in the morning and Davids wife Michal said to him If you do not go away to a safe place tonight you will be put to death in the morning
Sa  So Michal let David down through the window and he went in flight and got away
Sa  Then Michal took the image and put it in the bed with a cushion of goats hair at its head and she put clothing over it
Sa  And when Saul sent men to take David she said He is ill
Sa  And Saul sent his men to see David saying Do not come back without him take him in his bed so that I may put him to death
Sa  And when the men came in there was the image in the bed with the cushion of goats hair at its head
Sa  And Saul said to Michal why have you been false to me letting my hater go and get safely away And in answer Michal said to Saul He said to me Let me go or I will put you to death
Sa  So David went in flight and got away and came to Ramah to Samuel and gave him an account of all Saul had done to him And he and Samuel went and were living in Naioth
Sa  And word was given to Saul that David was at Naioth in Ramah
Sa  And Saul sent men to take David and when they saw the band of prophets at work with Samuel in his place at their head the spirit of God came on Sauls men and they became like prophets
Sa  And Saul having news of this sent other men who in the same way became like prophets And a third time Saul sent men and they like the others became like prophets
Sa  Then he himself went to Ramah and came to the great waterspring in Secu and questioning the people he said Where are Samuel and David And one said They are at Naioth in Ramah
Sa  And he went on from there to Naioth in Ramah and the spirit of God came on him and he went on acting like a prophet till he came to Naioth in Ramah
Sa  And he took off his clothing acting like a prophet before Samuel and falling down he was stretched out without his clothing all that day and all that night This is the reason for the saying Is even Saul among the prophets
Sa  And David went in flight from Naioth in Ramah and came to Jonathan and said What have I done What is my crime and my sin against your father that he is attempting to take my life
Sa  And he said to him Far be the thought you will not be put to death see my father does nothing great or small without giving me word of it would he keep this secret from me It is not so
Sa  But David took his oath again and said Your father sees that I am dear to you so he says to himself Let Jonathan have no idea of this for it will be a grief to him but as the Lord is living and as your soul is living there is only a step between me and death
Sa  Then Jonathan said to David Whatever your desire is I will do it for you
Sa  And David said to Jonathan Tomorrow is the new moon and I will not be seated with the king at his table but let me go to a safe place in the country till the evening
Sa  And if your father takes note of the fact that I am away say David made a request to me for himself that he might go to Bethlehem to his town for it is the time when his family make their offering year by year
Sa  If he says It is well your servant will be at peace but if he is angry then it will be clear to you that he has an evil purpose in mind against me
Sa  So then be kind to your servant for you have been united with your servant in an agreement made before the Lord but if there is any wrongdoing in me put me to death yourself why take me to your father
Sa  And Jonathan said Do not have such a thought for if I saw that my father was designing evil against you would I not give you word of it
Sa  Then David said to Jonathan Who will give me word if your father gives you a rough answer
Sa  And Jonathan said to David Come let us go out into the country And the two of them went out together into the open country
Sa  And Jonathan said to David May the Lord the God of Israel be witness when I have had a chance of talking to my father about this time tomorrow if his feelings to David are good will I not send and give you the news
Sa  May the Lords punishment be on Jonathan if it is my fathers pleasure to do you evil and I do not give you word of it and send you away so that you may go in peace and may the Lord be with you as he has been with my father
Sa  And may you while I am still living O may you be kind to me as the Lord is kind and keep me from death
Sa  And let not your mercy ever be cut off from my family even when the Lord has sent destruction on all Davids haters cutting them off from the face of the earth
Sa  And if it comes about that the name of Jonathan is cut off from the family of David the Lord will make David responsible
Sa  And Jonathan again took an oath to David because of his love for him for David was as dear to him as his very soul
Sa  Then Jonathan said to him Tomorrow is the new moon and it will be seen that you are not present for there will be no one in your seat
Sa  And on the third day it will be specially noted and you will go to the place where you took cover when the other business was in hand waiting by the hill over there
Sa  And on the third day I will send arrows from my bow against its side as if at a mark
Sa  And I will send my boy to have a look for the arrow And if I say to him See the arrow is on this side of you take it up then you may come for there is peace for you and no evil by the living Lord
Sa  But if I say to the boy See the arrow has gone past you then go on your way for the Lord has sent you away
Sa  As for what you and I were talking of the Lord is between you and me for ever
Sa  So David went to a secret place in the country and when the new moon came the king took his place at the feast
Sa  And the king took his seat as at other times by the wall and Jonathan was in front and Abner was seated by Sauls side but there was no one in Davids seat
Sa  But Saul said nothing that day for his thought was Something has taken place making him unclean it is clear that he is not clean
Sa  And on the day after the new moon that is the second day there was still no one in Davids seat and Saul said to his son Jonathan Why has the son of Jesse not come to the feast yesterday or today
Sa  And answering Saul Jonathan said He made a request to me that he might go to Bethlehem
Sa  Saying Our family is making an offering in the town and my brothers have given me orders to be there so now if I have grace in your eyes let me go away and see my brothers This is why he has not come to the kings table
Sa  Then Saul was moved to wrath against Jonathan and he said to him You son of an evil and uncontrolled woman have I not seen how you have given your love to the son of Jesse to your shame and the shame of your mother
Sa  For while the son of Jesse is living on the earth your position is unsafe and your kingdom is in danger So make him come here to me for it is certainly right for him to be put to death
Sa  And Jonathan answering his father Saul said to him Why is he to be put to death What has he done
Sa  And Saul pointing his spear at him made an attempt to give him a wound from which it was clear to Jonathan that his fathers purpose was to put David to death
Sa  So Jonathan got up from the table burning with wrath and took no part in the feast the second day of the month being full of grief for David because his father had put shame on him
Sa  Now in the morning Jonathan went out into the fields at the time he had said to David and he had a little boy with him
Sa  And he said to the boy Go and get the arrow I let loose from my bow And while the boy was running he sent an arrow past him
Sa  And when the boy came to the place where the arrow was Jonathan crying out after the boy said Has it not gone past you
Sa  And Jonathan went on crying out after the boy Be quick do not keep waiting about go quickly And Jonathans boy got the arrow and came back to his master
Sa  But the boy had no idea what was going on only Jonathan and David had knowledge of it
Sa  And Jonathan gave his bow and arrows to the boy and said to him Take these and go back to the town
Sa  And when the boy had gone David came from his secret place by the hill and falling to the earth went down on his face three times and they gave one another a kiss weeping together till Davids grief was the greater
Sa  And Jonathan said to David Go in peace for we two have taken an oath in the name of the Lord saying The Lord will be between me and you and between my seed and your seed for ever Then David went away and Jonathan went into the town
Sa  Then David came to Nob to Ahimelech the priest and Ahimelech was full of fear at meeting David and said to him Why are you by yourself having no man with you
Sa  And David said to Ahimelech the priest The king has given me orders and has said to me Say nothing to anyone about the business on which I am sending you and the orders I have given you and a certain place has been fixed to which the young men are to go
Sa  So now if you have here five cakes of bread give them into my hand or whatever you have
Sa  And the priest answering David said I have no common bread here but there is holy bread if only the young men have kept themselves from women
Sa  And David in answer said to the priest Certainly women have been kept from us and as has been done before when I have gone out the arms of the young men were made holy even though it was a common journey how much more today will their arms be made holy
Sa  So the priest gave him the holy bread there was no other only the holy bread which had been taken from before the Lord so that new bread might be put in its place on the day when it was taken away
Sa  Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day kept back before the Lord his name was Doeg an Edomite the strongest of Sauls runners
Sa  And David said to Ahimelech Have you no sword or spear with you here for I have come without my sword and other arms because the kings business had to be done quickly
Sa  And the priest said The sword of Goliath the Philistine whom you put to death in the valley of Elah is here folded in a cloth at the back of the ephod take that if you will for there is no other sword here And David said there is no other sword like that give it to me
Sa  Then David got up and went in flight that day for fear of Saul and went to Achish the king of Gath
Sa  And the servants of Achish said to him Is not this David the king of the land did they not make songs about him in their dances saying Saul has put to death thousands and David tens of thousands
Sa  And David took these words to heart fearing Achish the king of Gath
Sa  So changing his behaviour before them he made it seem as if he was off his head hammering on the doors of the town and letting the water from his mouth go down his chin
Sa  Then Achish said to his servants Look the man is clearly off his head why have you let him come before me
Sa  Are there not enough unbalanced men about me that you have let this person come and do such tricks before me is such a man to come into my house
Sa  So David went away from there and took cover in a strong place at Adullam and his brothers and all his fathers people hearing of it went down to him there
Sa  And everyone who was in trouble and everyone who was in debt and everyone who was bitter in soul came together to him and he became captain over them about four hundred men were joined to him
Sa  And from there David went to Mizpeh in the land of Moab and he said to the king of Moab Let my father and mother come and make their livingplace with you till it is clear to me what God will do for me
Sa  And he took them to the king of Moab and they went on living with him while David was in his safe place
Sa  And the prophet Gad said to David Do not go on living in this place but go into the land of Judah Then David went away and came to the woodland of Hereth
Sa  And news was given to Saul that David had been seen and the men who were with him now Saul was in Gibeah seated under the tree in the high place with his spear in his hand and all his servants were in their places before him
Sa  Then Saul said to his servants who were there about him Give ear now you Benjamites will the son of Jesse give to every one of you fields and vinegardens will he make you all captains of hundreds and captains of thousands
Sa  That all of you have made designs against me and not one of you gave me word when my son made an agreement with the son of Jesse and not one of you has pity for me or has made my eyes open to the fact that my servant has been moved by my son against me as at this day
Sa  Then Doeg the Edomite who was by the side of the servants of Saul in answer said I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub
Sa  And he got directions from the Lord for him and gave him food and put in his hand the sword of Goliath the Philistine
Sa  Then the king sent for Ahimelech the priest the son of Ahitub and for all the men of his fathers family who were priests in Nob and they all came to the king
Sa  And Saul said Give ear now O son of Ahitub And answering he said Here I am my lord
Sa  And Saul said to him Why have you made designs against me with the son of Jesse giving him food and a sword and getting directions from the Lord for him and helping him to take up arms against me and to be on the watch to make a secret attack on me as he is doing now
Sa  Then Ahimelech answering said to the king Who among all your servants is so true to you as David who is the kings soninlaw and is a captain of your armed men and has a place of honour in your house
Sa  Is this the first time I have got directions from God for him Far be the thought let the king make no such statement against his servant or my fathers family for your servant has no knowledge great or small of this thing
Sa  And the king said You will certainly be put to death Ahimelech you and all your fathers family
Sa  Then the king said to the runners who were waiting near him Put the priests of the Lord to death because they are on Davids side and having knowledge of his flight did not give me word of it But the kings servants would not put out their hands to make an attack on the Lords priests
Sa  Then the king said to Doeg You are to put the priests to death And Doeg the Edomite turning on the priests and attacking them put to death that day eightyfive men who took up the ephod
Sa  And Nob the town of the priests he put to the sword all the men and women children and babies at the breast and oxen and asses and sheep
Sa  And Abiathar one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub got away and went in flight after David
Sa  And gave him the news of how Saul had put to death the Lords priests
Sa  And David said to Abiathar I was certain that day when Doeg the Edomite was there that he would take the news to Saul I am responsible for the lives of all your fathers family
Sa  Keep here with me and have no fear for he who has designs on my life has designs on yours but with me you will be safe
Sa  And they sent word to David saying The Philistines are fighting against Keilah and taking the grain from the grainfloors
Sa  So David questioning the Lord said Am I to go and make an attack on these Philistines And the Lord said to David Go and make an attack on the Philistines so that Keilah may be kept from falling into their hands
Sa  And Davids men said to him Even here in Judah we are full of fear how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines
Sa  Then David put the question to the Lord again and the Lord answering said Up go down to Keilah for I will give the Philistines into your hands
Sa  So David and his men went to Keilah and had a fight with the Philistines and took away their cattle and put them to the sword with great destruction So David was the saviour of the people of Keilah
Sa  Now when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech went in flight to David he came down to Keilah with the ephod in his hand
Sa  And news was given to Saul that David had come to Keilah And Saul said Now God has given him into my hands for by going into a walled town with locked doors he has let himself be shut in
Sa  And Saul sent for all the people to come to the fight and go down to Keilah to make an attack on David and his men
Sa  And it was clear to David that Saul had evil designs against him and he said to Abiathar the priest Come here with the ephod
Sa  Then David said O Lord the God of Israel news has been given to your servant that it is Sauls purpose to come to Keilah and send destruction on the town because of me
Sa  And now is it true as they have said to me that Saul is coming O Lord the God of Israel give ear to your servant and say if these things are so And the Lord said He is coming down
Sa  Then David said Will the men of Keilah give me and my men up to Saul and the Lord said They will give you up
Sa  Then David and his men about six hundred of them went out of Keilah and got away wherever they were able to go And Saul hearing that David had got away from Keilah did not go there
Sa  And David kept in the waste land in safe places waiting in the hillcountry in the waste land of Ziph And Saul was searching for him every day but God did not give him up into his hands
Sa  And David was full of fear in the knowledge that Saul had come out to take his life and David was in the waste land of Ziph in Horesh
Sa  And Sauls son Jonathan went to David in Horesh and made his hands strong in God
Sa  And said to him Have no fear for Saul my father will not get you into his power and you will be king of Israel and I will be by your side and my father Saul is certain of this
Sa  And the two of them made an agreement before the Lord and David went on living in Horesh and Jonathan went back to his house
Sa  Then the Ziphites came up to Gibeah to see Saul and said Is not David living secretly among us in the strong places in Horesh in the hill of Hachilah to the south of the waste land
Sa  So now O king have your souls desire and come down and we for our part will give him up into the kings hands
Sa  And Saul said The Lords blessing will be yours for you have had pity on me
Sa  Go now and take more steps and see where he is living for they say that he is expert in deceit
Sa  So take care to get knowledge of all the secret places where he is taking cover and be certain to come back to me and I will go with you and without doubt if he is anywhere in the land I will get him among all the families of Judah
Sa  And they went back and came to Ziph before Saul but David and his men were in the waste land of Maon in the dry land south of the waste land
Sa  And Saul and his men went in search of him And David had word of it so he came down to the rock in the waste land of Maon And Saul hearing of this went after David into the waste land of Maon
Sa  And Saul and his men went on one side of the mountain and David and his men went on the other and Davids purpose was to get away as quickly as possible for fear of Saul for Saul and his men were making a circle round David and his men in order to take them
Sa  But a man came to Saul saying Be quick and come for the Philistines have made an attack on the land
Sa  So turning back from going after David Saul went against the Philistines so that place was named Selahammahlekoth
Sa  And from there David went up and took cover in the safe place of Engedi
Sa  Now when Saul came back from fighting the Philistines news was given him that David was in the waste land of Engedi
Sa  Then Saul took three thousand of the best men out of all Israel and went in search of David and his men on the rocks of the mountain goats
Sa  And on the way he came to a place where sheep were kept where there was a hollow in the rock and Saul went in for a private purpose Now David and his men were in the deepest part of the hollow
Sa  And Davids men said to him Now is the time when the Lord says to you I will give up your hater into your hands to do with him whatever seems good to you Then David getting up took the skirt of Sauls robe in his hand cutting off the end of it without his knowledge
Sa  And later David was full of regret for cutting off Sauls skirt
Sa  And David said to his men Before the Lord never let it be said that my hand was lifted up against my lord the man of the Lords selection for the Lords holy oil has been put on him
Sa  So with these words David kept his servants back and did not let them make an attack on Saul And Saul got up and went on his way
Sa  And after that David came out of the hollow rock and crying after Saul said My lord the king And when Saul gave a look back David went down on his face and gave him honour
Sa  And David said to Saul Why do you give any attention to those who say that it is my desire to do you wrong
Sa  Look you have seen today how the Lord gave you up into my hands even now in the hollow of the rocks and some would have had me put you to death but I had pity on you for I said Never will my hand be lifted up against my lord who has been marked with the holy oil
Sa  And see my father see the skirt of your robe in my hand for the fact that I took off the skirt of your robe and did not put you to death is witness that I have no evil purpose and I have done you no wrong though you are waiting for my life to take it
Sa  May the Lord be judge between me and you and may the Lord give me my rights against you but my hand will never be lifted up against you
Sa  There is an old saying From the evildoer comes evil but my hand will never be lifted up against you
Sa  After whom has the king of Israel come out for whom are you searching for a dead dog an insect
Sa  So let the Lord be judge and give a decision between me and you and see and give support to my cause and keep me from falling into your hands
Sa  Now when David had said these words to Saul Saul said Is this your voice David my son And Saul was overcome with weeping
Sa  And he said to David You are right and I am wrong for you have given me back good but I have given you evil
Sa  And you have made clear to me how good you have been to me today because when the Lord gave me up into your hands you did not put me to death
Sa  If a man comes across his hater will he let him get away safe so may you be rewarded by the Lord for what you have done for me today
Sa  And now I am certain that you will be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be made strong under your authority
Sa  So give me your oath by the Lord that you will not put an end to my seed after me or let my name be cut off from my fathers family
Sa  And David gave Saul his oath And Saul went back to his house but David and his men went up to their safe place
Sa  And death came to Samuel and all Israel came together weeping for him and put his body in its restingplace in his house at Ramah Then David went down to the waste land of Maon
Sa  Now there was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel he was a great man and had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats and he was cutting the wool of his sheep in Carmel
Sa  Now this man was named Nabal and his wifes name was Abigail she was a woman of good sense and pleasing looks but the man was cruel and evil in his ways he was of the family of Caleb
Sa  And David had word in the waste land that Nabal was cutting the wool of his sheep
Sa  And David sent ten young men and said to them Go up to Carmel and go to Nabal and say kind words to him in my name
Sa  And say this to my brother May all be well for you peace be to you and your house and all you have
Sa  I have had word that you have woolcutters now the keepers of your sheep have been with us and we have done them no evil and taken nothing of theirs while they were in Carmel
Sa  If your young men are questioned they will say the same thing So now let my young men have grace in your eyes for we are come at a good time please give anything you may have by you to your servants and to your son David
Sa  And when Davids young men came they said all this to Nabal in Davids name and said nothing more
Sa  And Nabal gave them his answer and said Who is David who is the son of Jesse there are a number of servants in these days running away from their masters
Sa  Am I to take my bread and my wine and the meat I have got ready for my woolcutters and give it to men coming from I have no idea where
Sa  So Davids young men turning away went back and gave him an account of everything he had said
Sa  And David said to his men Put on your swords every one of you And every man put on his sword and David did the same and about four hundred men went up with David and two hundred kept watch over their goods
Sa  But one of the young men said to Nabals wife Abigail David sent men from the waste land to say kind words to our master and he gave them a rough answer
Sa  But these men have been very good to us they did us no wrong and nothing of ours was touched while we were with them in the fields
Sa  But day and night they were like a wall round us while we were with them looking after the sheep
Sa  So now give thought to what you are going to do for evil is in store for our master and all his house for he is such a goodfornothing person that it is not possible to say anything to him
Sa  Then Abigail quickly took two hundred cakes of bread and two skins full of wine and five sheep ready for cooking and five measures of dry grain and a hundred parcels of dry grapes and two hundred cakes of figs and put them on asses
Sa  And she said to her young men Go on in front of me and I will come after you But she said nothing to her husband Nabal
Sa  Now while she was going down under cover of the mountain on her ass David and his men came down against her and suddenly she came face to face with them
Sa  Now David had said What was the use of my taking care of this mans goods in the waste land so that there was no loss of anything which was his he has only given me back evil for good
Sa  May Gods punishment be on David if when morning comes there is so much as one male of his people still living
Sa  And when Abigail saw David she quickly got off her ass falling down on her face before him
Sa  And falling at his feet she said May the wrong be on me my lord on me let your servant say a word to you and give ear to the words of your servant
Sa  Let my lord give no attention to Nabal that goodfornothing for as his name is so is he a man without sense but I your servant did not see the young men whom my lord sent
Sa  So now my lord by the living God and by your living soul seeing that the Lord has kept you from the crime of blood and from taking into your hands the punishment for your wrongs may all your haters and those who would do evil to my lord be like Nabal
Sa  And let this offering which your servant gives to my lord be given to the young men who are with my lord
Sa  And may the sin of your servant have forgiveness for the Lord will certainly make your family strong because my lord is fighting in the Lords war and no evil will be seen in you all your days
Sa  And though a man has taken up arms against you putting your life in danger still the soul of my lord will be kept safe among the band of the living with the Lord your God and the souls of those who are against you he will send violently away from him like stones from a bag
Sa  And when the Lord has done for my lord all those good things which he has said he will do for you and has made you a ruler over Israel
Sa  Then you will have no cause for grief and my lords heart will not be troubled because you have taken life without cause and have yourself given punishment for your wrongs and when the Lord has been good to you then give a thought to your servant
Sa  And David said to Abigail May the Lord the God of Israel be praised who sent you to me today
Sa  A blessing on your good sense and on you who have kept me today from the crime of blood and from taking into my hands the punishment for my wrongs
Sa  For truly by the living Lord the God of Israel who has kept me from doing you evil if you had not been so quick in coming to me and meeting me by dawn there would not have been in Nabals house so much as one male living
Sa  Then David took from her hands her offering and he said to her Go back to your house in peace see I have given ear to your voice and taken your offering with respect
Sa  And Abigail went back to Nabal and he was feasting in his house like a king and Nabals heart was full of joy for he had taken much wine so she said nothing to him till dawn came
Sa  And in the morning when the effect of the wine was gone Nabals wife gave him an account of all these things and all the heart went out of him and he became like stone
Sa  And about ten days after the Lord sent disease on Nabal and death came to him
Sa  And David hearing that Nabal was dead said May the Lord be praised who has taken up my cause against Nabal for the shame which he put on me and has kept back his servant from evil and has sent on Nabals head the reward of his evildoing And David sent word to Abigail desiring to take her as his wife
Sa  And when Davids servants came to Carmel to Abigail they said to her David has sent us to you to take you to him as his wife
Sa  And she got up and going down on her face to the earth said See I am ready to be a servantgirl washing the feet of the servants of my lord
Sa  Then Abigail got up quickly and went on her ass with five of her young women after the men whom David had sent and she became Davids wife
Sa  And David had taken Ahinoam of Jezreel to be his wife these two were his wives
Sa  Now Saul had given his daughter Michal Davids wife to Palti the son of Laish of Gallim
Sa  And the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah and said Is not David waiting secretly near us in the hill of Hachilah before the waste land
Sa  Then Saul went down to the waste land of Ziph taking with him three thousand of the best men of Israel to make search for David in the waste land of Ziph
Sa  And Saul put up his tents on the hill of Hachilah which is in front of the waste land on the road But David was in the waste land and he saw that Saul was coming after him
Sa  And so David sent out watchers and got word from them that Saul was certainly coming
Sa  And David got up and came to the place where Sauls tents were and David had a view of the place where Saul was sleeping with Abner the son of Ner the captain of his army and Saul was sleeping inside the ring of carts and the tents of the people were all round him
Sa  Then David said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah brother of Joab Who will go down with me to the tents of Saul And Abishai said I will go down with you
Sa  So David and Abishai came down to the army by night and Saul was sleeping inside the ring of carts with his spear planted in the earth by his head and Abner and the people were sleeping round him
Sa  Then Abishai said to David God has given up your hater into your hands today now let me give him one blow through to the earth with his spear and there will be no need to give him a second
Sa  And David said to Abishai Do not put him to death for who without sin may put out his hand against the man on whom the Lord has put the holy oil
Sa  And David said By the living Lord the Lord will send destruction on him the natural day of his death will come or he will go into the fight and come to his end
Sa  Never will my hand be stretched out against the man marked with the holy oil but take the spear which is by his head and the vessel of water and let us go
Sa  So David took the spear and the vessel of water from Sauls head and they got away without any man seeing them or being conscious of their coming or awaking for they were all sleeping because a deep sleep from the Lord had come on them
Sa  Then David went over to the other side and took his place on the top of a mountain some distance away with a great space between them
Sa  And crying out to the people and to Abner the son of Ner David said Have you no answer to give Abner Then Abner said Who is that crying out to the king
Sa  And David said to Abner Are you not a man of war is there any other like you in Israel why then have you not kept watch over your lord the king for one of the people came in to put the king your lord to death
Sa  What you have done is not good By the living Lord death is the right fate for you because you have not kept watch over your lord the man on whom the Lord has put the holy oil Now see where is the kings spear and the vessel of water which was by his head
Sa  And Saul conscious that the voice was Davids said Is that your voice David my son And David said It is my voice O my lord king
Sa  And he said Why does my lord go armed against his servant what have I done or what evil is there in me
Sa  Let my lord the king give ear now to the words of his servant If it is the Lord who is moving you against me let him take an offering but if it is the children of men may they be cursed before the Lord for driving me out today and keeping me from my place in the heritage of the Lord saying Go be the servant of other gods
Sa  Then do not let my blood be drained out on the earth away from the face of the Lord for the king of Israel has come out to take my life like one going after birds in the mountains
Sa  Then Saul said I have done wrong come back to me David my son I will do you no more wrong because my life was dear to you today truly I have been foolish and my error is very great
Sa  Then David said Here is the kings spear let one of the young men come over and get it
Sa  And the Lord will give to every man the reward of his righteousness and his faith because the Lord gave you into my hands today and I would not put out my hand against the man who has been marked with the holy oil
Sa  And so as your life was dear to me today may my life be dear to the Lord and may he make me free from all my troubles
Sa  Then Saul said to David May a blessing be on you David my son you will do great things and without doubt you will overcome Then David went on his way and Saul went back to his place
Sa  And David said to himself Some day death will come to me by the hand of Saul the only thing for me to do is to get away into the land of the Philistines then Saul will give up hope of taking me in any part of the land of Israel and so I may be able to get away from him
Sa  So David and the six hundred men who were with him went over to Achish the son of Maoch king of Gath
Sa  And David and his men were living with Achish at Gath every man had his family with him and David had his two wives Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel who had been the wife of Nabal
Sa  And Saul hearing that David had gone to Gath went after him no longer
Sa  Then David said to Achish If now I have grace in your eyes let me have a place in one of the smaller towns of your land to be my livingplace for it is not right for your servant to be living with you in the kings town
Sa  So Achish straight away gave him Ziklag and for that reason Ziklag has been the property of the kings of Judah to this day
Sa  And David was living in the land of the Philistines for the space of a year and four months
Sa  And David and his men went up and made attacks on the Geshurites and the Girzites and the Amalekites for these were the people who were living in the land from Telam on the way to Shur as far as Egypt
Sa  And David again and again made attacks on the land till not a man or a woman was still living and he took away the sheep and the oxen and the asses and the camels and the clothing and he came back to Achish
Sa  And every time Achish said Where have you been fighting today David said Against the South of Judah and the South of the Jerahmeelites and the South of the Kenites
Sa  Not one living man or woman did David ever take back with him to Gath fearing that they might give an account of what had taken place and say This is what David did and so has he been doing all the time while he has been living in the land of the Philistines
Sa  And Achish had belief in what David said saying He has made himself hated by all his people Israel and so he will be my servant for ever
Sa  Now in those days the Philistines got their forces together to make war on Israel And Achish said to David Certainly you and your men are to go out with me to the fight
Sa  And David said to Achish You will see now what your servant will do And Achish said to David Then I will make you keeper of my head for ever
Sa  Now Samuel was dead and all Israel after weeping for him had put his body in its last restingplace in Ramah his town And Saul had put away from the land all those who had control of spirits and who made use of secret arts
Sa  And the Philistines came together and put their forces in position in Shunem and Saul got all Israel together and they took up their positions in Gilboa
Sa  And when Saul saw the Philistine army he was troubled and his heart was moved with fear
Sa  And when Saul went for directions to the Lord the Lord gave him no answer by a dream or by the Urim or by the prophets
Sa  Then Saul said to his servants Get me a woman who has control of a spirit so that I may go to her and get directions And his servants said to him There is such a woman at Endor
Sa  So Saul putting on other clothing so that he might not be seen to be the king took two men with him and went to the woman by night and he said Now with the help of the spirit which you have make the person whose name I will give you come up
Sa  And the woman said to him But you have knowledge of what Saul has done how he has put away out of the land those who have control of spirits and the users of secret arts why would you by a trick put me in danger of death
Sa  And Saul made an oath to her by the Lord saying By the living Lord no punishment will come to you for this
Sa  Then the woman said Who am I to let you see And he said Make Samuel come up for me
Sa  And the woman saw that it was Saul and she gave a loud cry and said to Saul Why have you made use of deceit for you are Saul
Sa  And the king said to her Have no fear what do you see And the woman said to Saul I see a god coming up out of the earth
Sa  And he said to her What is his form And she said It is an old man coming up covered with a robe And Saul saw that it was Samuel and with his face bent down to the earth he gave him honour
Sa  And Samuel said to Saul Why have you made me come up troubling my rest And Saul in answer said I am in great danger for the Philistines are making war on me and God has gone away from me and will no longer give me any answer by the prophets or by dreams so I have sent for you to make clear to me what I am to do
Sa  And Samuel said Why do you put your questions to me seeing that God has gone away from you and is on the side of him who is against you
Sa  And the Lord himself has done what I said the Lord has taken the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbour David
Sa  Because you did not do what the Lord said and did not give effect to his burning wrath against Amalek So the Lord has done this thing to you today
Sa  And more than this the Lord will give Israel up with you into the hands of the Philistines and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me and the Lord will give up the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines
Sa  Then Saul went down flat on the earth and was full of fear because of Samuels words and there was no strength in him for he had taken no food all that day or all that night
Sa  And the woman came to Saul and saw that he was in great trouble and said to him See now your servant has given ear to your words and I have put my life in danger by doing what you said
Sa  So now give ear to the voice of your servant and let me give you a little bread and take some food to give you strength when you go on your way
Sa  But he would not saying I have no desire for food But his servants together with the woman made him take food and he gave way to them So he got up from the earth and took his seat on the bed
Sa  And the woman had in the house a young cow made fat for food and she put it to death straight away and she took meal and got it mixed and made unleavened bread
Sa  And she put it before Saul and his servants and they had a meal Then they got up and went away the same night
Sa  Now the Philistines got all their army together at Aphek and the Israelites put their forces in position by the fountain in Jezreel
Sa  And the lords of the Philistines went on with their hundreds and their thousands and David and his men came after with Achish
Sa  Then the rulers of the Philistines said What are these Hebrews doing here And Achish said to the rulers of the Philistines Is this not David the servant of Saul the king of Israel who has been with me for a year or two and I have never seen any wrong in him from the time when he came to me till now
Sa  But the rulers of the Philistines were angry with him and said to him Make the man go back to the place you have given him do not let him go down with us to the fight or he may be turned against us and be false to us for how will this man make peace with his lord will it not be with the heads of these men
Sa  Is this not David who was named in their songs when in the dance they said to one another Saul has put to death thousands and David tens of thousands
Sa  Then Achish sent for David and said to him By the living Lord you are upright and everything you have done with me in the army has been pleasing to me I have seen no evil in you from the day when you came to me till now but still the lords are not pleased with you
Sa  So now go back and go in peace so that you do not make the lords of the Philistines angry
Sa  And David said to Achish But what have I done what have you seen in your servant while I have been with you till this day that I may not go and take up arms against those who are now making war on my lord the king
Sa  And Achish in answer said It is true that in my eyes you are good like an angel of God but still the rulers of the Philistines have said He is not to go up with us to the fight
Sa  So get up early in the morning with the servants of your lord who are with you and go to the place I have given you and have no evil design in your heart for you are good in my eyes but when there is light enough in the morning go away
Sa  So David and his men got up early in the morning to go back to the land of the Philistines And the Philistines went up to Jezreel
Sa  Now when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day the Amalekites had made an attack on the South and on Ziklag and had overcome Ziklag and put it on fire
Sa  And had made the women and all who were there small and great prisoners they had not put any of them to death but had taken them all away
Sa  And when David and his men came to the town they saw that it had been burned down and their wives and their sons and daughters had been made prisoners
Sa  Then David and the people who were with him gave themselves up to weeping till they were able to go on weeping no longer
Sa  And Davids two wives Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the wife of Nabal of Carmel had been made prisoners
Sa  And David was greatly troubled for the people were talking of stoning him because their hearts were bitter every man sorrowing for his sons and his daughters but David made himself strong in the Lord his God
Sa  And David said to Abiathar the priest the son of Ahimelech Come here to me with the ephod And Abiathar took the ephod to David
Sa  Then David questioning the Lord said Am I to go after this band will I be able to overtake them And in answer he said Go after them for you will certainly overtake them and get back everything
Sa  So David went and his six hundred men went with him and they came to the stream Besor
Sa  And David with four hundred men went on but two hundred of them were overcome with weariness and not able to go across the stream
Sa  And in the fields they saw an Egyptian whom they took to David and they gave him bread and he had a meal and they gave him water for drink
Sa  And they gave him part of a cake of figs and some dry grapes and after the food his spirit came back to him for he had had no food or drink for three days and nights
Sa  And David said to him Whose man are you and where do you come from And he said I am a young man of Egypt servant to an Amalekite and my master went on without me because three days back I became ill
Sa  We made an attack on the south part of the country of the Cherethites and on the land which is Judahs and on the south of Caleb and we put Ziklag on fire
Sa  And David said to him Will you take me down to this band And he said If you give me your oath that you will not put me to death or give me up to my master I will take you to them
Sa  And when he had taken him down they saw them all seated about on all sides feasting and drinking among all the mass of goods which they had taken from the land of the Philistines and the land of Judah
Sa  And David went on fighting them from evening till the evening of the day after and not one of them got away but only four hundred young men who went in flight on camels
Sa  And David got back everything the Amalekites had taken and he got back his two wives
Sa  There was no loss of anything small or great sons or daughters or goods or anything which they had taken away David got it all back
Sa  And they took all the flocks and herds and driving them in front of him said These are Davids
Sa  And David came to the two hundred men who because of weariness had not gone with him but were waiting at the stream Besor and they went out meeting David and the people who were with him and when they came near them they said How are you
Sa  Then the bad and goodfornothing men among those who went with David said Because they did not go with us we will give them nothing of the goods which we have got back but only to every man his wife and children so that he may take them and go
Sa  Then David said You are not to do this my brothers after what the Lord has given us who has kept us safe and given up the band which came against us into our hands
Sa  Who is going to give any attention to you in this question for an equal part will be given to him who went to the fight and to him who was waiting by the goods they are all to have the same
Sa  And so he made it a rule and an order for Israel from that day till now
Sa  And when David came to Ziklag he sent some of the goods to the responsible men of Judah and to his friends saying Here is an offering for you from the goods of those who were fighting against the Lord
Sa  He sent to those who were in Bethel and in Ramah of the South and in Jattir
Sa  And to those in Arara and Eshtemoa
Sa  and Carmel and in the towns of the Jerahmeelites and in the towns of the Kenites
Sa  And to those who were in Hormah and in Borashan and in Athach
Sa  And in Hebron and to all the places where David and his men had been living
Sa  Now the Philistines were fighting against Israel and the men of Israel went in flight before the Philistines falling down wounded in Mount Gilboa
Sa  And the Philistines overtook Saul and his sons and they put to death Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchishua the sons of Saul
Sa  And the fight was going badly for Saul and the archers came across him and he was wounded by the archers
Sa  Then Saul said to the servant who had the care of his arms Take out your sword and put it through me before these men without circumcision come and make sport of me But his servant full of fear would not do so Then Saul took out his sword and falling on it put an end to himself
Sa  And when his servant saw that Saul was dead he did the same and was united with him in death
Sa  So death overtook Saul and his three sons and his servant on the same day
Sa  And when the men of Israel across the valley and on the other side of Jordan saw that the army of Israel was in flight and that Saul and his sons were dead they came out of their towns and went in flight and the Philistines came and took them for themselves
Sa  Now on the day after when the Philistines came to take their goods from the dead they saw Saul and his three sons dead on the earth in Mount Gilboa
Sa  And cutting off his head and taking away his wardress they sent word into the land of the Philistines round about to take the news to their gods and to the people
Sa  His wardress they put in the house of Astarte and his body was fixed on the wall of Bethshan
Sa  And when the people of Jabeshgilead had news of what the Philistines had done to Saul
Sa  All the fighting men got up and travelling all night took Sauls body and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan and they came to Jabesh and had them burned there
Sa  And their bones they put in the earth under a tree in Jabesh and for seven days they took no food
Sa  Now after the death of Saul when David having come back from the destruction of the Amalekites had been in Ziklag for two days
Sa  On the third day a man came from Sauls tents with his clothing out of order and earth on his head and when he came to David he went down on the earth and gave him honour
Sa  And David said to him Where have you come from And he said I have come in flight from the tents of Israel
Sa  And David said to him How did things go Give me the news And in answer he said The people have gone in flight from the fight and a great number of them are dead and Saul and his son Jonathan are dead
Sa  And David said to the young man who gave him the news Why are you certain that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead
Sa  And the young man said I came by chance to Mount Gilboa and I saw Saul supporting himself on his spear and the warcarriages and horsemen overtook him
Sa  And looking back he saw me and gave a cry to me And answering him I said Here am I
Sa  And he said to me Who are you And I said I am an Amalekite
Sa  Then he said to me Come here to my side and put me to death for the pain of death has me in its grip but my life is still strong in me
Sa  So I put my foot on him and gave him his deathblow because I was certain that he would not go on living after his fall and I took the crown from his head and the band from his arm and I have them here for my lord
Sa  Then David gave way to bitter grief and so did all the men who were with him
Sa  And till evening they gave themselves to sorrow and weeping and took no food weeping for Saul and for Jonathan his son and for the people of the Lord and for the men of Israel because they had come to their end by the sword
Sa  And David said to the young man who had given him the news Where do you come from And he said I am the son of a man from a strange land I am an Amalekite
Sa  And David said to him Had you no fear of stretching out your hand to put to death the one marked with the holy oil
Sa  And David sent for one of his young men and said Go near and put an end to him And he put him to death
Sa  And David said to him May your blood be on your head for your mouth has given witness against you saying I have put to death the man marked with the holy oil
Sa  Then David made this song of grief for Saul and Jonathan his son
Sa  It is recorded in the book of Jashar for teaching to the sons of Judah and he said
Sa  The glory O Israel is dead on your high places How have the great ones been made low
Sa  Give no news of it in Gath let it not be said in the streets of Ashkelon or the daughters of the Philistines will be glad the daughters of men without circumcision will be uplifted in joy
Sa  O mountains of Gilboa let there be no dew or rain on you you fields of death for there the arms of the strong have been shamed the arms of Saul as if he had not been marked with the holy oil
Sa  From the blood of the dead from the fat of the strong the bow of Jonathan was not turned back the sword of Saul did not come back unused
Sa  Saul and Jonathan were loved and pleasing in their lives and in their death they were not parted they went more quickly than eagles they were stronger than lions
Sa  O daughters of Israel have sorrow for Saul by whom you were delicately clothed in robes of red with ornaments of gold on your dresses
Sa  How have the great ones been made low in the fight Jonathan is dead on your high places
Sa  I am full of grief for you my brother Jonathan very dear have you been to me your love for me was a wonder greater than the love of women
Sa  How have the great ones been made low and the arms of war broken
Sa  Now after this David questioning the Lord said Am I to go up into any of the towns of Judah And the Lord said to him Go up And David said Where am I to go And he said To Hebron
Sa  So David went there taking with him his two wives Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the wife of Nabal of Carmel
Sa  And David took all his men with him every man with his family and they were living in the towns round Hebron
Sa  And the men of Judah came there and with the holy oil made David king over the people of Judah And word came to David that it was the men of Jabeshgilead who put Sauls body in its last restingplace
Sa  And David sent to the men of Jabeshgilead and said to them May the Lord give you his blessing because you have done this kind act to Saul your lord and have put his body to rest
Sa  May the Lord be good and true to you and I myself will see that your kind act is rewarded because you have done this thing
Sa  Then let your hands be strong and have no fear though Saul your lord is dead the people of Judah have made me their king
Sa  Now Abner the son of Ner captain of Sauls army had taken Sauls son Ishbosheth over to Mahanaim
Sa  And made him king over Gilead and the Asherites and over Jezreel and Ephraim and Benjamin that is over all Israel
Sa  Sauls son Ishbosheth was forty years old when he became king over Israel and he was ruler for two years But Judah was on the side of David
Sa  And the time when David was king in Hebron over the people of Judah was seven years and six months
Sa  And Abner the son of Ner with the servants of Sauls son Ishbosheth went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon
Sa  And Joab the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David went out and came face to face with them by the pool of Gibeon and they took up their position facing one another on opposite sides of the pool
Sa  And Abner said to Joab Let the young men give a test of their strength before us And Joab said Let them do so
Sa  So they got up and went over by number twelve for Benjamin and Ishbosheth and twelve of the servants of David
Sa  And every one got the other by the head driving his sword into the others side so they all went down together and that place was named the Field of Sides and it is in Gibeon
Sa  And there was hard fighting that day and Abner and the men of Israel gave way before the servants of David
Sa  There were three sons of Zeruiah there Joab and Abishai and Asahel and Asahel was as quickfooted as a roe of the fields
Sa  Asahel went running after Abner not turning to the right or to the left
Sa  Then Abner looking back said Is it you Asahel And he said It is I
Sa  And Abner said Then go to the right or to the left and put your hands on one of the fightingmen and take his arms But Asahel would not be turned away from going after Abner
Sa  Then again Abner said to Asahel Go to one side do not keep on coming after me why will you make me put an end to you for then I will be shamed before your brother Joab
Sa  But still he did not go to one side so Abner gave him a back blow in the stomach with his spear so that the spear came out at his back and he went down on the earth wounded to death and all those who came to the place where Asahel went down dead came to a stop
Sa  But Joab and Abishai went after Abner and the sun went down when they came to the hill of Ammah which is to the east of the road through the waste land of Geba
Sa  And the men of Benjamin came together after Abner in one band and took their places on the top of a hill
Sa  Then crying out to Joab Abner said Are fighting and destruction to go on for ever do you not see that the end will only be bitter how long will it be before you send the people back and make them give up attacking their countrymen
Sa  And Joab said By the living God if you had not given the word the people would have gone on attacking their countrymen till the morning
Sa  So Joab had a horn sounded and all the people came to a stop and gave up going after Israel and fighting them
Sa  And all that night Abner and his men went through the Arabah they went over Jordan and through all Bithron and came to Mahanaim
Sa  And Joab came back from fighting Abner and when he had got all his men together it was seen that nineteen of Davids men in addition to Asahel were not with them
Sa  But Davids men had put to death three hundred and sixty of the men of Benjamin and of Abners men
Sa  And they took Asahels body and put it in the last restingplace of his father in Bethlehem And Joab and his men travelling all night came to Hebron at dawn
Sa  Now there was a long war between Sauls people and Davids people and David became stronger and stronger but those on Sauls side became more and more feeble
Sa  While David was in Hebron he became the father of sons the oldest was Amnon son of Ahinoam of Jezreel
Sa  And the second Chileab whose mother was Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite and the third Absalom son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur
Sa  And the fourth Adonijah the son of Haggith and the fifth Shephatiah the son of Abital
Sa  And the sixth Ithream whose mother was Davids wife Eglah These were the sons of David whose birth took place in Hebron
Sa  Now while there was war between Sauls people and Davids people Abner was making himself strong among the supporters of Saul
Sa  Now Saul had among his wives a woman named Rizpah the daughter of Aiah and Ishbosheth said to Abner Why have you taken my fathers wife
Sa  And Abner was very angry at the words of Ishbosheth and he said Am I a dogs head of Judah I am this day doing all in my power for the cause of your father Saul and for his brothers and his friends and have not given you up into the hands of David and now you say I have done wrong with a woman
Sa  May Gods punishment be on Abner if I do not for David as the Lord in his oath has said
Sa  And if I do not take away the kingdom from the family of Saul and make David ruler over Israel and Judah from Dan as far as Beersheba
Sa  And so great was Ishbosheths fear of Abner that he was not able to say a word in answer
Sa  And Abner sent men to David at Hebron saying Make an agreement with me and I will give you my support in getting all Israel on your side
Sa  And he said It is well I will make an agreement with you but on one condition which is that when you come before me Sauls daughter Michal is to come with you till she comes you will not see my face
Sa  And David sent men to Sauls son Ishbosheth saying Give me back Michal my wife whom I made mine for the price of the private parts of a hundred Philistines
Sa  So Ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband Paltiel the son of Laish
Sa  And her husband went with her as far as Bahurim weeping while he went Then Abner said to him Go back And he went back
Sa  Then Abner had a talk with the chief men of Israel saying In the past it was your desire to make David your king so now do it
Sa  For the Lord has said of David By the hand of my servant David I will make my people Israel safe from the Philistines and from all who are against them
Sa  And Abner said the same things to Benjamin and he went to David in Hebron to make clear to him what seemed good to Israel and to all the people of Benjamin
Sa  So Abner with twenty men came to Hebron to David And David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him
Sa  And Abner said to David Now I will go and make all Israel come to my lord the king so that they may make an agreement with you and your kingdom may be as wide as your hearts desire Then David sent Abner away and he went in peace
Sa  Now the servants of David and Joab had been out attacking a band of armed men and they came back with a great store of goods taken in the fight but Abner was no longer in Hebron with David for he had sent him away and he had gone in peace
Sa  When Joab and his men came news was given them that Abner the son of Ner had come to the king who had let him go away again in peace
Sa  Then Joab came to the king and said What have you done when Abner came to you why did you send him away and let him go
Sa  Is it not clear to you that Abner the son of Ner came with deceit to get knowledge of your going out and your coming in and of all you are doing
Sa  And when Joab had come out from David he sent men after Abner and they overtook him at the waterspring of Sirah and made him come back with them but David had no knowledge of it
Sa  And when Abner was back in Hebron Joab took him on one side by the doorway of the town to have a word with him quietly and there he gave him a wound in the stomach causing his death in payment for the death of his brother Asahel
Sa  And when David had word of it he said May I and my kingdom be clear for ever in the eyes of the Lord from the blood of Abner the son of Ner
Sa  May it come on the head of Joab and all his fathers family among the men of Joabs family may there ever be some who are diseased or lepers or who do the work of women or are put to the sword or are wasted from need of food
Sa  So Joab and Abishai his brother put Abner to death because he had put to death their brother Asahel in the fight at Gibeon
Sa  And David said to Joab and all the people who were with him Go in grief and put haircloth about you in sorrow for Abner And King David went after the dead body
Sa  And they put Abners body to rest in Hebron and the king and all the people were weeping loudly by the restingplace of Abners body
Sa  And the king made a song of grief for Abner and said Was the death of Abner to be like the death of a foolish man
Sa  Your hands were free your feet were not chained like the downfall of a man before evil men so was your fall And the weeping of the people over him went on again
Sa  And the people came to make David take food while it was still day but David with an oath said May Gods punishment be on me if I take a taste of bread or any other thing till the sun has gone down
Sa  And all the people took note of it and were pleased like everything the king did it was pleasing to the people
Sa  So it was clear to Israel and to all the people on that day that the king was not responsible for the death of Abner the son of Ner
Sa  And the king said to his servants Do you not see that a chief and a great man has come to his end today in Israel
Sa  While I though I am crowned king have little strength and these men the sons of Zeruiah are out of my control may the Lord give to the evildoer the reward of his evildoing
Sa  And when Sauls son Ishbosheth had news that Abner was dead in Hebron his hands became feeble and all the Israelites were troubled
Sa  And Sauls son had two men captains of bands one named Baanah and the other Rechab sons of Rimmon the Beerothite of the tribe of Benjamin for Beeroth was at one time taken to be part of Benjamin
Sa  But the people of Beeroth had gone in flight to Gittaim where they have been living to this day
Sa  Now Jonathan Sauls son had a son whose feet were damaged He was five years old when news of the death of Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel and the woman who took care of him took him up and went in flight and while she was getting him away as quickly as she was able he had a fall and his feet were damaged His name was Mephibosheth
Sa  And Rechab and Baanah the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite went out and came to the house of Ishbosheth in the heat of the day when he was resting in the middle of the day Now the woman who kept the door was cleaning grain and sleep overcame her
Sa  And Rechab and his brother Baanah got in without being seen
Sa  And when they came into the house Ishbosheth was stretched on his bed in his bedroom and they made an attack on him and put him to death and cutting off his head they took it with them and went by the road through the Arabah all night
Sa  And they took the head of Ishbosheth to David in Hebron and said to the king Here is the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul your hater who would have taken your life the Lord has taken payment for the wrongs of my lord the king from Saul and his seed today
Sa  And David made answer to Rechab and his brother Baanah the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite and said to them By the living Lord who has kept me safe from all my trouble
Sa  When one came to me with the news of Sauls death in the belief that it would be good news I took him and put him to death in Ziklag which was the reward I gave him for his news
Sa  How much more when evil men have put an upright person to death in his house sleeping on his bed will I take payment from you for his blood and have you cut off from the earth
Sa  And David gave orders to his young men and they put them to death cutting off their hands and their feet and hanging them up by the side of the pool in Hebron But they took the head of Ishbosheth and put it in its last restingplace with Abners body in Hebron
Sa  Then all the tribes of Israel came to David in Hebron and said Truly we are your bone and your flesh
Sa  In the past when Saul was king over us it was you who went at the head of Israel when they went out or came in and the Lord said to you You are to be the keeper of my people Israel and their ruler
Sa  So all the responsible men of Israel came to the king at Hebron and King David made an agreement with them in Hebron before the Lord and they put the holy oil on David and made him king over Israel
Sa  David was thirty years old when he became king and he was king for forty years
Sa  Ruling over Judah in Hebron for seven years and six months and in Jerusalem over all Israel and Judah for thirtythree years
Sa  And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites the people of the land and they said to David You will not come in here but the blind and the feeblefooted will keep you out for they said David will not be able to come in here
Sa  But David took the strong place of Zion which is the town of David
Sa  And that day David said Whoever makes an attack on the Jebusites let him go up by the waterpipe and put to death all the blind and feeblefooted who are hated by David And this is why they say The blind and feeblefooted may not come into the house
Sa  So David took the strong tower for his livingplace naming it the town of David And David took in hand the building of the town all round starting from the Millo
Sa  And David became greater and greater for the Lord the God of armies was with him
Sa  And Hiram king of Tyre sent men to David with cedartrees and woodworkers and stoneworkers and they made David a house
Sa  And David saw that the Lord had made his position safe as king over Israel and that he had made his kingdom great because of his people Israel
Sa  And David took more women and wives in Jerusalem after he had come from Hebron and he had more sons and daughters
Sa  These are the names of those whose birth took place in Jerusalem Shammua and Shobab and Nathan and Solomon
Sa  And Ibhar and Elishua and Nepheg and Japhia
Sa  And Elishama and Eliada and Eliphelet
Sa  And when the Philistines had news that David had been made king over Israel they all went up in search of David and David hearing of it went down to the strong place
Sa  And when the Philistines came they went in every direction in the valley of Rephaim
Sa  And David desiring directions from the Lord said Am I to go up against the Philistines will you give them up into my hands And the Lord said Go up for I will certainly give up the Philistines into your hands
Sa  And David went to Baalperazim and overcame them there and he said The Lord has let the forces fighting against me be broken before me as a wall is broken by rushing waters So that place was named Baalperazim
Sa  And the Philistines when they went in flight did not take their images with them and David and his men took them away
Sa  And the Philistines came up again and went in every direction in the valley of Rephaim
Sa  And when David went for directions to the Lord he said You are not to go up against them in front but make a circle round them from the back and come on them opposite the spicetrees
Sa  Then at the sound of footsteps in the tops of the trees go forward quickly for the Lord has gone out before you to overcome the army of the Philistines
Sa  And David did as the Lord had said and he overcame the Philistines attacking them from Gibeon to near Gezer
Sa  And David got together all the fightingmen of Israel to the number of thirty thousand
Sa  And David and all the people who were with him went to Baal of Judah to get the ark of God over which the holy name is named the name of the Lord of armies whose place is between the winged ones
Sa  And they put the ark of God on a new cart and took it out of the house of Abinadab which was on the hill and Uzzah and Ahio the sons of Abinadab were the drivers of the cart
Sa  And Uzzah went by the side of the ark while Ahio went before it
Sa  And David and all the men of Israel made melody before the Lord with all their power with songs and with corded instruments and instruments of brass
Sa  And when they came to Nacons grainfloor Uzzah put his hand on the ark of God to keep it safe in its place for the oxen were out of control
Sa  And the wrath of the Lord burning against Uzzah sent destruction on him because he had put his hand on the ark and death came to him there by the ark of God
Sa  And David was angry because of the Lords outburst of wrath against Uzzah and he gave that place the name Perezuzzah which is its name to this day
Sa  And such was Davids fear of the Lord that day that he said How may I let the ark of God come to me
Sa  So David did not let the ark of the Lord come back to him to the town of David but had it turned away and put into the house of Obededom the Gittite
Sa  And the ark of the Lord was in the house of Obededom the Gittite for three months and the Lord sent a blessing on Obededom and all his family
Sa  And they said to King David The blessing of the Lord is on the family of Obededom and on all he has because of the ark of God And David went and took the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the town of David with joy
Sa  And when those who were lifting the ark of the Lord had gone six steps he made an offering of an ox and a fat young beast
Sa  And David clothed in a linen ephod was dancing before the Lord with all his strength
Sa  So David and all the men of Israel took up the ark of the Lord with cries of joy and sounding of horns
Sa  And when the ark of the Lord came into the town of David Michal Sauls daughter looking out of the window saw King David dancing and jumping before the Lord and to her mind he seemed foolish
Sa  And they took in the ark of the Lord and put it in its place inside the tent which David had put up for it and David made burned offerings and peaceofferings to the Lord
Sa  And after David had made the burned offerings and the peaceofferings he gave the people a blessing in the name of the Lord of armies
Sa  And he gave to every man and woman among all the people among all the masses of Israel a cake of bread and a measure of wine and a cake of dry grapes Then all the people went away every man to his house
Sa  Then David came back to give a blessing to his family And Michal Sauls daughter came out to him and said How full of glory was the king of Israel today who let himself be seen uncovered by his servantgirls like a foolish person uncovering himself without shame
Sa  And David said to Michal I was dancing before the Lord who put me over your father and all his sons to make me a ruler over the people of the Lord over his people Israel and I will go on playing before the Lord
Sa  And I will do even worse than this and make myself even lower in your eyes but the servantgirls of whom you were talking will give me honour
Sa  And Michal Sauls daughter had no child till the day of her death
Sa  Now when the king was living in his house and the Lord had given him rest from war on every side
Sa  The king said to Nathan the prophet See now I am living in a house of cedar but the ark of God is housed inside the curtains of a tent
Sa  And Nathan said to the king Go and do whatever is in your heart for the Lord is with you
Sa  Now that night the word of the Lord came to Nathan saying
Sa  Go and say to my servant David The Lord says Are you to be the builder of a house a livingplace for me
Sa  For from the day when I took the children of Israel up out of Egypt till this day I have had no house but have gone from place to place in a tent
Sa  In all the places where I went with all the children of Israel did I ever say to any of the judges of Israel to whom I gave the care of my people Israel Why have you not made me a house of cedar
Sa  Then say these words to my servant David The Lord of armies says I took you from the fields from keeping the sheep so that you might be a ruler over my people over my people Israel
Sa  And I have been with you wherever you went cutting off before you all those who were against you and I will make your name great like the name of the greatest ones of the earth
Sa  And I will make a restingplace for my people Israel planting them there so that they may be living in the place which is theirs and never again be moved and never again will they be troubled by evil men as they were at the first
Sa  From the time when I put judges over my people Israel and I will give you peace from all who are against you And the Lord says to you that he will make you the head of a line of kings
Sa  And when the time comes for you to go to rest with your fathers I will put in your place your seed after you the offspring of your body and I will make his kingdom strong
Sa  He will be the builder of a house for my name and I will make the seat of his authority certain for ever
Sa  I will be to him a father and he will be to me a son if he does wrong I will give him punishment with the rod of men and with the blows of the children of men
Sa  But my mercy will not be taken away from him as I took it from him who was before you
Sa  And your family and your kingdom will keep their place before me for ever the seat of your authority will never be overturned
Sa  So Nathan gave David an account of all these words and this vision
Sa  Then David the king went in and took his seat before the Lord and said Who am I O Lord God and what is my family that you have been my guide till now
Sa  And this was only a small thing to you O Lord God but your words have even been about the faroff future of your servants family O Lord God
Sa  What more may David say to you for you have knowledge of your servant O Lord God
Sa  Because of your word and from your heart you have done all this great work and let your servant see it
Sa  Truly you are great O Lord God there is no one like you and no other God but you as is clear from everything which has come to our ears
Sa  And what other nation in the earth like your people Israel did a god go out to take for himself to be his people and to make a name for himself and to do great and strange things for them driving out a nation and its gods from before his people
Sa  But you took and made strong for yourself your people Israel to be your people for ever and you Lord became their God
Sa  And now O Lord God may the word which you have said about your servant and about his family be made certain for ever and may you do as you have said
Sa  And let your name be made great for ever and let men say The Lord of armies is God over Israel and let the family of David your servant be made strong before you
Sa  For you O Lord of armies the God of Israel have clearly said to your servant I will make you the head of a family of kings and so it has come into your servants heart to make this prayer to you
Sa  And now O Lord God you are God and your words are true and you have said you will give your servant this good thing
Sa  So may it be your pleasure to give your blessing to the family of your servant so that it may go on for ever before you for you O Lord God have said it and may your blessing be on your servants family line for ever
Sa  And it came about after this that David made an attack on the Philistines and overcame them and David took the authority of the mothertown from the hands of the Philistines
Sa  And he overcame the Moabites and he had them measured with a line when they were stretched out on the earth marking out two lines for death and one full line for life So the Moabites became servants to David and gave him offerings
Sa  And David overcame Hadadezer the son of Rehob king of Zobah when he went to make his power seen by the River
Sa  And David took from him one thousand seven hundred horsemen and twenty thousand footmen and David had the legmuscles of the horses cut only keeping enough of them for a hundred warcarriages
Sa  And when the Aramaeans of Damascus came to the help of Hadadezer king of Zobah David put to the sword twentytwo thousand of the Aramaeans
Sa  And David put armed forces in Aram of Damascus and the Aramaeans became servants to David and gave him offerings And the Lord made David overcome wherever he went
Sa  And David took their gold bodycovers from the servants of Hadadezer and took them to Jerusalem
Sa  And from Tebah and Berothai towns of Hadadezer King David took a great store of brass
Sa  And when Tou king of Hamath had news that David had overcome all the army of Hadadezer
Sa  He sent his son Hadoram to David with words of peace and blessing because he had overcome Hadadezer in the fight for Hadadezer had wars with Tou and Hadoram took with him vessels of silver and gold and brass
Sa  These King David made holy to the Lord together with the silver and gold which he had taken from the nations he had overcome
Sa  The nations of Edom and Moab and the children of Ammon and the Philistines and the Amalekites and the goods he had taken from Hadadezer the son of Rehob king of Zobah
Sa  And David got great honour for himself when he came back by the destruction of Edom in the valley of Salt to the number of eighteen thousand men
Sa  And he put armed forces in Edom all through Edom he had armed forces stationed and all the Edomites became servants to David And the Lord made David overcome wherever he went
Sa  And David was king over all Israel judging and giving right decisions for all his people
Sa  And Joab the son of Zeruiah was chief of the army and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was keeper of the records
Sa  And Zadok and Abiathar the son of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub were priests and Seraiah was the scribe
Sa  And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites and Davids sons were priests
Sa  And David said Is there still anyone of Sauls family living so that I may be a friend to him because of Jonathan
Sa  Now there was of Sauls people a servant named Ziba and they sent him to David and the king said to him Are you Ziba And he said I am
Sa  And the king said Is there anyone of Sauls family still living to whom I may be a friend in Gods name And Ziba said There is a son of Jonathan whose feet are damaged
Sa  And the king said to him Where is he And Ziba said to the king He is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel in Lodebar
Sa  Then King David sent and had him taken from Lodebar from the house of Machir the son of Ammiel
Sa  And Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan came to David and falling down on his face gave him honour And David said Mephibosheth And answering he said Your servant is here
Sa  And David said to him Have no fear for truly I will be good to you because of your father Jonathan and I will give back to you all the land which was Sauls and you will have a place at my table at all times
Sa  And he went down on his face before the king and said What is your servant for you to take note of a dead dog such as I am
Sa  Then the king sent for Ziba Sauls servant and said to him All the property of Saul and of his family I have given to your masters son
Sa  And you and your sons and your servants are to take care of the land for him and get in the fruit of it so that your masters son may have food but Mephibosheth your masters son will have a place at my table at all times Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants
Sa  Then Ziba said to the king Every order which you have given to your servant will be done As for Mephibosheth he had a place at Davids table like one of the kings sons
Sa  And Mephibosheth had a young son named Mica And all the people living in the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth
Sa  So Mephibosheth went on living in Jerusalem for he took all his meals at the kings table and he had not the use of his feet
Sa  Now after this death came to the king of the children of Ammon and Hanun his son became king in his place
Sa  And David said I will be a friend to Hanun the son of Nahash as his father was a friend to me So David sent his servants to give him words of comfort on account of his father And Davids servants came into the land of the children of Ammon
Sa  But the chiefs of the children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord Does it seem to you that David is honouring your father by sending comforters to you has he not sent his servants to go through the town and make secret observation of it and overcome it
Sa  So Hanun took Davids servants and after cutting off half the hair on their chins and cutting off the skirts of their robes up to the middle he sent them away
Sa  When David had news of it he sent men out with the purpose of meeting them on their way for the men were greatly shamed and the king said Go to Jericho till your hair is long again and then come back
Sa  And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves hated by David they sent to the Aramaeans of Bethrehob and Zobah and got for payment twenty thousand footmen and they got from the king of Maacah a thousand men and from Tob twelve thousand
Sa  And hearing of this David sent Joab and all the army and the best fightingmen
Sa  And the children of Ammon came out and put their forces in position at the way into the town and the Aramaeans of Zobah and of Rehob with the men of Tob and Maacah were by themselves in the field
Sa  Now when Joab saw that their forces were in position against him in front and at his back he took the best of the men of Israel and put them in line against the Aramaeans
Sa  And the rest of the people he put in position against the children of Ammon with Abishai his brother at their head
Sa  And he said If the Aramaeans are stronger and get the better of me then you are to come to my help but if the children of Ammon get the better of you I will come to your help
Sa  Take heart and let us be strong for our people and for the towns of our God and may the Lord do what seems good to him
Sa  Then Joab and the people with him went forward to the fight against the Aramaeans and they went in flight before him
Sa  And when the children of Ammon saw the flight of the Aramaeans they themselves went in flight from Abishai and came into the town So Joab went back from fighting the children of Ammon and came to Jerusalem
Sa  And when the Aramaeans saw that Israel had overcome them they got themselves together
Sa  And Hadadezer sent for the Aramaeans who were on the other side of the River and they came to Helam with Shobach the captain of Hadadezers army at their head
Sa  And word of this was given to David and he got all Israel together and went over Jordan and came to Helam And the Aramaeans put their forces in position against David and made an attack on him
Sa  And the Aramaeans went in flight before Israel and David put to the sword the men of seven hundred Aramaean warcarriages and forty thousand footmen and Shobach the captain of the army was wounded and came to his death there
Sa  And when all the kings who were servants of Hadadezer saw that they were overcome by Israel they made peace with Israel and became their servants So the Aramaeans in fear gave no more help to the children of Ammon
Sa  Now in the spring at the time when kings go out to war David sent Joab and his servants and all Israel with him and they made waste the land of the children of Ammon and took up their position before Rabbah shutting it in But David was still at Jerusalem
Sa  Now one evening David got up from his bed and while he was walking on the roof of the kings house he saw from there a woman bathing and the woman was very beautiful
Sa  And David sent to get knowledge who the woman was And one said Is this not Bathsheba the daughter of Eliam and wife of Uriah the Hittite
Sa  And David sent and took her and she came to him and he took her to his bed for she had been made clean then she went back to her house
Sa  And the woman became with child and she sent word to David that she was with child
Sa  And David sent to Joab saying Send Uriah the Hittite to me And Joab sent Uriah to David
Sa  And when Uriah came to him David put questions to him about how Joab and the people were and how the war was going
Sa  And David said to Uriah Go down to your house and let your feet be washed And Uriah went away from the kings house and an offering from the king was sent after him
Sa  But Uriah took his rest at the door of the kings house with all the servants of his lord and did not go down to his house
Sa  And when word was given to David that Uriah had not gone down to his house David said to Uriah Have you not come from a journey why did you not go down to your house
Sa  And Uriah said to David Israel and Judah with the ark are living in tents and my lord Joab and the other servants of my lord are sleeping in the open field and am I to go to my house and take food and drink and go to bed with my wife By the living Lord and by the life of your soul I will not do such a thing
Sa  And David said to Uriah Be here today and after that I will let you go So Uriah was in Jerusalem that day and the day after
Sa  And when David sent for him he took meat and drink with him and David made him the worse for drink and when evening came he went to rest on his bed with the servants of his lord but he did not go down to his house
Sa  Now in the morning David gave Uriah a letter to take to Joab
Sa  And in the letter he said Take care to put Uriah in the very front of the line where the fighting is most violent and go back from him so that he may be overcome and put to death
Sa  So while Joab was watching the town he put Uriah in the place where it was clear to him the best fighters were
Sa  And the men of the town went out and had a fight with Joab and a number of Davids men came to their death in the fight and with them Uriah the Hittite
Sa  Then Joab sent David news of everything which had taken place in the war
Sa  And he gave orders to the man who took the news saying After you have given the king all the news about the war
Sa  If the king is angry and says Why did you go so near the town for the fight was it not certain that their archers would be on the wall
Sa  Who put Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal to death did not a woman send a great stone down on him from the wall putting him to death at Thebez why did you go so near the wall Then say to him Your servant Uriah the Hittite is among the dead
Sa  So the man went and came to David and gave him all the news which Joab had sent him to give then David was angry with Joab and said Why did you go so near the town for the fight was it not certain that their archers would be on the wall who put Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal to death did not a woman send a great stone down on him from the wall putting him to death at Thebez why did you go so near the wall
Sa  And the man said to David Truly the men got the better of us and came out against us into the open country but we sent them back to the very doors of the town
Sa  And the archers sent their arrows at your servants from the wall and some of the kings servants are dead and among them is your servant Uriah the Hittite
Sa  Then David said to the man Go and say to Joab Do not let this be a grief to you for one man may come to his death by the sword like another put up an even stronger fight against the town and take it and do you put heart into him
Sa  And when the wife of Uriah had news that her husband was dead she gave herself up to weeping for him
Sa  And when the days of weeping were past David sent for her and took her into his house and she became his wife and gave him a son But the Lord was not pleased with the thing David had done
Sa  And the Lord sent Nathan to David And Nathan came to him and said There were two men in the same town one a man of great wealth and the other a poor man
Sa  The man of wealth had great numbers of flocks and herds
Sa  But the poor man had only one little shelamb which he had got and taken care of from its birth it had been with him like one of his children his meat was its food and from his cup it took its drink resting in his arms and it was like a daughter to him
Sa  Now a traveller came to the house of the man of wealth but he would not take anything from his flock or his herd to make a meal for the traveller who had come to him but he took the poor mans lamb and made it ready for the man who had come
Sa  And David was full of wrath against that man and he said to Nathan By the living Lord death is the right punishment for the man who has done this
Sa  And he will have to give back four times the value of the lamb because he has done this and because he had no pity
Sa  And Nathan said to David You are that man The Lord God of Israel says I made you king over Israel putting holy oil on you and I kept you safe from the hands of Saul
Sa  I gave you your masters daughter and your masters wives for yourself and I gave you the daughters of Israel and Judah and if that had not been enough I would have given you such and such things
Sa  Why then have you had no respect for the word of the Lord doing what is evil in his eyes You have put Uriah the Hittite to death with the sword and have taken his wife to be your wife you have put him to death with the sword of the children of Ammon
Sa  So now the sword will never be turned away from your family because you have had no respect for me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife
Sa  The Lord says From those of your family I will send evil against you and before your very eyes I will take your wives and give them to your neighbour and he will take your wives to his bed by the light of this sun
Sa  You did it secretly but I will do this thing before all Israel and in the light of the sun
Sa  And David said to Nathan Great is my sin against the Lord And Nathan said to David The Lord has put away your sin death will not come on you
Sa  But still because you have had no respect for the Lord death will certainly overtake the child who has newly come to birth
Sa  Then Nathan went back to his house And the hand of the Lord was on Davids son the child of Uriahs wife and it became very ill
Sa  So David made prayer to God for the child and he took no food day after day and went in and stretching himself out on the earth was there all night
Sa  And the chief men of his house got up and went to his side to make him get up from the earth but he would not and he would not take food with them
Sa  And then on the seventh day the childs death took place And Davids servants were in fear of giving him the news of the childs death for they said Truly while the child was still living he gave no attention when we said anything to him what will he do to himself if we give him word that the child is dead
Sa  But when David saw that his servants were talking together quietly he was certain that the child was dead and he said to his servants Is the child dead and they said He is
Sa  Then David got up from the earth and after washing and rubbing himself with oil and changing his clothing he went into the house of the Lord and gave worship then he went back to his house and at his order they put food before him and he had a meal
Sa  Then his servants said to him Why have you been acting in this way you were weeping and going without food while the child was still living but when the child was dead you got up and had a meal
Sa  And he said While the child was still living I went without food and gave myself up to weeping for I said Who is able to say that the Lord will not have mercy on me and give the child life
Sa  But now that the child is dead there is no reason for me to go without food am I able to make him come back to life I will go to him but he will never come back to me
Sa  And David gave comfort to his wife Bathsheba and he went in to her and had connection with her and she had a son to whom she gave the name Solomon And he was dear to the Lord
Sa  And he sent word by Nathan the prophet who gave him the name Jedidiah by the word of the Lord
Sa  Now Joab was fighting against Rabbah in the land of the children of Ammon and he took the watertown
Sa  And Joab sent men to David saying I have made war against Rabbah and have taken the watertown
Sa  So now get the rest of the people together and put them in position against the town and take it for if I take it it will be named after my name
Sa  Then David got all the people together and went to Rabbah and made war on it and took it
Sa  And he took the crown of Milcom from his head the weight of it was a talent of gold and in it were stones of great price and it was put on Davids head And he took a great store of goods from the town
Sa  And he took the people out of the town and put them to work with woodcutting instruments and iron graincrushers and iron axes and at brickmaking this he did to all the towns of the children of Ammon Then David and all the people went back to Jerusalem
Sa  Now after this it came about that Absalom Davids son had a beautiful sister whose name was Tamar and Davids son Amnon was in love with her
Sa  And he was so deeply in love that he became ill because of his sister Tamar for she was a virgin and so it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her
Sa  But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab the son of Shimeah Davids brother and Jonadab was a very wise man
Sa  And he said to him O son of the king why are you getting thinner day by day will you not say what your trouble is And Amnon said to him I am in love with Tamar my brother Absaloms sister
Sa  Then Jonadab said to him Go to your bed and let it seem that you are ill and when your father comes to see you say to him Let my sister Tamar come and give me bread and get the food ready before my eyes so that I may see it and take it from her hand
Sa  So Amnon went to bed and made himself seem ill and when the king came to see him Amnon said to the king Please let my sister Tamar come and make me one or two cakes before my eyes so that I may take food from her hand
Sa  Then David sent to the house for Tamar and said Go now to your brother Amnons house and get a meal for him
Sa  So Tamar went to her brother Amnons house and he was in bed And she took paste and made cakes before his eyes cooking them over the fire
Sa  And she took the cookingpot and put the cakes before him but he would not take them And Amnon said Let everyone go away from me So they all went out
Sa  Then Amnon said to Tamar Take the food and come into my bedroom so that I may take it from your hand So Tamar took the cakes she had made and went with them into her brother Amnons bedroom
Sa  And when she took them to give them to him he put his arms round her and said Come to bed my sister
Sa  And answering him she said O my brother do not put shame on me it is not right for such a thing to be done in Israel do not this evil thing
Sa  What will become of me in my shame and as for you you will be looked down on with disgust by all Israel Now then go and make your request to the king for he will not keep me from you
Sa  But he would not give attention to what she said but being stronger than she he took her by force and had connection with her
Sa  Then Amnon was full of hate for her hating her with a hate greater than his earlier love for her And he said to her Get up and be gone
Sa  And she said to him Not so my brother for this great wrong in sending me away is worse than what you did to me before But he gave no attention to her
Sa  Then he gave a cry to the servant who was waiting on him and said Put this woman out and let the door be locked after her
Sa  Now she had on a long robe such as in past times the kings virgin daughters were dressed in Then the servant put her out locking the door after her
Sa  And Tamar in her grief put dust on her head and she put her hand on her head and went away crying loudly
Sa  And her brother Absalom said to her Has your brother Amnon been with you but now let there be an end to your crying my sister he is your brother do not take this thing to heart So Tamar went on living uncomforted in her brothers house
Sa  But when King David had news of all these things he was very angry but he did not make trouble for Amnon his son for he was dear to David being his oldest son
Sa  But Absalom said nothing to his brother Amnon good or bad for he was full of hate for him because he had taken his sister Tamar by force
Sa  Now after two full years Absalom had men cutting the wool of his sheep in Baalhazor which is near Ephraim and he sent for all the kings sons to come to his feast
Sa  And Absalom came to the king and said See now your servant is cutting the wool of his sheep will the king and his servants be pleased to come
Sa  And the king said to Absalom No my son let us not all go or the number will be overgreat for you And he made his request again but he would not go but he gave him his blessing
Sa  Then Absalom said If you will not go then let my brother Amnon go with us And the king said to him Is there any reason for him to go with you
Sa  But Absalom went on requesting him till he let Amnon and all the kings sons go with him And Absalom made a great feast like a feast for a king
Sa  Now Absalom had given orders to his servants saying Now take note when Amnons heart is glad with wine and when I say to you Make an attack on Amnon then put him to death without fear have I not given you orders be strong and without fear
Sa  So Absaloms servants did to Amnon as Absalom had given them orders Then all the kings sons got up and every man got on his beast and went in flight
Sa  Now while they were on their way news was given to David that Absalom had put to death all the sons of the king and that not one of them was still living
Sa  Then the king got up in great grief stretching himself out on the earth and all his servants were by his side with their clothing parted
Sa  And Jonadab the son of Shimeah Davids brother said Let not my lord have the idea that all the sons of the king have been put to death for only Amnon is dead this has been purposed by Absalom from the day when he took his sister Tamar by force
Sa  So now let not my lord the king take this thing to heart with the idea that all the kings sons are dead for only Amnon is dead
Sa  But Absalom went in flight And the young man who kept the watch lifting up his eyes saw that a great band of people was coming down the slope by the way of the Horons and the watchman came and gave word to the king saying I saw men coming down by the way of the Horons from the hillside
Sa  And Jonadab said to the king See the kings sons are coming as your servant said so it is
Sa  And while he was talking the kings sons came with weeping and loud cries and the king and all his servants were weeping bitterly
Sa  So Absalom went in flight and came to Talmai the son of Ammihud the king of Geshur where he was for three years
Sa  And the king was sorrowing for his son all the time
Sa  And the heart of David was wasted with desire for Absalom for he was comforted for the death of Amnon
Sa  Now it was clear to Joab the son of Zeruiah that the kings heart was turning to Absalom
Sa  And Joab sent to Tekoa and got from there a wise woman and said to her Now make yourself seem like one given up to grief and put on the clothing of sorrow not using any sweet oil for your body but looking like one who for a long time has been weeping for the dead
Sa  And come to the king and say these words to him So Joab gave her words to say
Sa  And the woman of Tekoa came to the king and falling on her face gave him honour and said Give me help O king
Sa  And the king said to her What is your trouble And her answer was Truly I am a widow and my husband is dead
Sa  And I had two sons and the two of them had a fight in the field and there was no one to come between them and one with a blow put the other to death
Sa  And now all the family is turned against me your servant saying Give up him who was the cause of his brothers death so that we may put him to death in payment for the life of his brother whose life he took and we will put an end to the one who will get the heritage so they will put out my last burning coal and my husband will have no name or offspring on the face of the earth
Sa  And the king said to the woman Go to your house and I will give orders about this
Sa  And the woman of Tekoa said to the king My lord O king may the sin be on me and on my family and may the king and the seat of his kingdom be clear of sin
Sa  And the king said If anyone says anything to you make him come to me and he will do you no more damage
Sa  Then she said Let the king keep in mind the Lord your God so that he who gives punishment for blood may be kept back from further destruction and that no one may send death on my son And he said By the living Lord not a hair of your sons head will come to the earth
Sa  Then the woman said Will the king let his servant say one word more And he said Say on
Sa  And the woman said Why have you had such a thought about the people of God for in saying these very words the king has put himself in the wrong because he has not taken back the one whom he sent far away
Sa  For death comes to us all and we are like water drained out on the earth which it is not possible to take up again and God will not take away the life of the man whose purpose is that he who has been sent away may not be completely cut off from him
Sa  And now it is my fear of the people which has made me come to say these words to my lord the king and your servant said I will put my cause before the king and it may be that he will give effect to my request
Sa  For the king will give ear and take his servant out of the power of the man whose purpose is the destruction of me and my son together from the heritage of God
Sa  Then your servant said May the word of my lord the king give me peace for my lord the king is as the angel of God in his hearing of good and bad and may the Lord your God be with you
Sa  Then the king said to the woman Now give me an answer to the question I am going to put to you keep nothing back And the woman said Let my lord the king say on
Sa  And the king said Is not the hand of Joab with you in all this And the woman in answer said By the life of your soul my lord the king it is not possible for anyone to go to the right hand or to the left from anything said by the king your servant Joab gave me orders and put all these words in my mouth
Sa  This he did hoping that the face of this business might be changed and my lord is wise with the wisdom of the angel of God having knowledge of everything on earth
Sa  And the king said to Joab See now I will do this thing go then and Come back with the young man Absalom
Sa  Then Joab falling down on his face on the earth gave the king honour and blessing and Joab said Today it is clear to your servant that I have grace in your eyes my lord king because the king has given effect to the request of his servant
Sa  So Joab got up and went to Geshur and came back again to Jerusalem with Absalom
Sa  And the king said Let him go to his house but let him not see my face So Absalom went back to his house and did not see the face of the king
Sa  Now in all Israel there was no one so greatly to be praised for his beautiful form as Absalom from his feet to the crown of his head he was completely beautiful
Sa  And when he had his hair cut which he did at the end of every year because of the weight of his hair the weight of the hair was two hundred shekels by the kings weight
Sa  And Absalom was the father of three sons and of one daughter named Tamar who was very beautiful
Sa  For two full years Absalom was living in Jerusalem without ever seeing the face of the king
Sa  Then Absalom sent for Joab to send him to the king but he would not come to him and he sent again a second time but he would not come
Sa  So he said to his servants See Joabs field is near mine and he has barley in it go and put it on fire And Absaloms servants put the field on fire
Sa  Then Joab came to Absalom in his house and said to him Why have your servants put my field on fire
Sa  And Absaloms answer was See I sent to you saying Come here so that I may send you to the king to say Why have I come back from Geshur it would be better for me to be there still let me now see the kings face and if there is any sin in me let him put me to death
Sa  So Joab went to the king and said these words to him and when the king had sent for him Absalom came and went down on his face on the earth before the king and the king gave him a kiss
Sa  Now after this Absalom got for himself a carriage and horses and fifty runners to go before him
Sa  And Absalom got up early morning after morning and took his place at the side of the public meetingplace and when any man had a cause which had to come to the king to be judged then Absalom crying out to him said What is your town and he would say Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel
Sa  And Absalom would say to him See your cause is true and right but no man has been named by the king to give you a hearing
Sa  And more than this Absalom said If only I was made judge in the land so that every man who has any cause or question might come to me and I would give a right decision for him
Sa  And if any man came near to give him honour he took him by the hand and gave him a kiss
Sa  And this Absalom did to everyone in Israel who came to the king to have his cause judged so Absalom like a thief took away the hearts of the men of Israel
Sa  Now at the end of four years Absalom said to the king Let me go to Hebron and give effect to the oath which I made to the Lord
Sa  For while I was living in Geshur in Aram your servant made an oath saying If ever the Lord lets me come back to Jerusalem I will give him worship in Hebron
Sa  And the king said to him Go in peace So he got up and went to Hebron
Sa  But Absalom at the same time sent watchers through all the tribes of Israel to say At the sound of the horn you are to say Absalom is king in Hebron
Sa  And with Absalom at his request went two hundred men from Jerusalem who were completely unconscious of his designs
Sa  And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite one of Davids helpers from Giloh his town while he was making the offerings And the design against David became strong for more and more people were joined to Absalom
Sa  And one came to David and said The hearts of the men of Israel have gone after Absalom
Sa  And David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem Come let us go in flight or not one of us will be safe from Absalom let us go without loss of time or he will overtake us quickly and send evil on us and put the town to the sword
Sa  And the kings servants said to the king See your servants are ready to do whatever the king says is to be done
Sa  So the king went out taking with him all the people of his house but for ten of his women who were to take care of the house
Sa  And the king went out and all his servants went after him and made a stop at the Far House
Sa  And all the people went on by his side and all the Cherethites and all the Pelethites and all the men of Ittai of Gath six hundred men who came after him from Gath went on before the king
Sa  Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite Why are you coming with us go back and keep with the king for you are a man of another country you are far from the land of your birth
Sa  It was only yesterday you came to us why then am I to make you go up and down with us for I have to go where I may go back then and take your countrymen with you and may the Lords mercy and good faith be with you
Sa  And Ittai the Gittite in answer said By the living Lord and by the life of my lord the king in whatever place my lord the king may be for life or death there will your servant be
Sa  And David said to Ittai Go forward then And Ittai the Gittite went on with all his men and all the little ones he had with him
Sa  And there was great weeping in all the country when all the people went through and the king himself was waiting in the Kidron valley and all the people went by him in the direction of the olivetree on the edge of the waste land
Sa  Then Zadok came and Abiathar and with them the ark of Gods agreement and they put down the ark of God till all the people from the town had gone by
Sa  And the king said to Zadok Take the ark of God back into the town if I have grace in the eyes of the Lord he will let me come back and see it and his House again
Sa  But if he says I have no delight in you then here I am let him do to me what seems good to him
Sa  The king said further to Zadok the priest See you and Abiathar are to go back to the town in peace with your two sons Ahimaaz your son and Jonathan the son of Abiathar
Sa  See I will be waiting at the way across the river in the waste land till I get news from you
Sa  So Zadok and Abiathar took the ark of God back to Jerusalem and did not go away from there
Sa  And David went up the slopes of the Mount of Olives weeping all the way with his head covered and no shoes on his feet and all the people who were with him covering their heads went up weeping
Sa  And word came to David saying Ahithophel is among those who are joined to Absalom And David said O Lord let the wisdom of Ahithophel be made foolish
Sa  Now when David had come to the top of the slope where they gave worship to God Hushai the Archite came to him in great grief with dust on his head
Sa  David said to him If you go on with me you will be a trouble to me
Sa  But if you go back to the town and say to Absalom I will be your servant O king as in the past I have been your fathers servant so now I will be yours then you will be able to keep Ahithophels designs against me from being put into effect
Sa  And have you not there Zadok and Abiathar the priests so whatever comes to your ears from the kings house give word of it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests
Sa  See they have with them their two sons Ahimaaz Zadoks son and Jonathan the son of Abiathar by them you may send word to me of everything which comes to your ears
Sa  So Hushai Davids friend went into the town and Absalom came to Jerusalem
Sa  And when David had gone a little way past the top of the slope Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth came to him with two asses on which were two hundred cakes of bread and a hundred stems of dry grapes and a hundred summer fruits and a skin of wine
Sa  And David said to Ziba What is your reason for this And Ziba said The asses are for the use of the kings people and the bread and the fruit are food for the young men and the wine is for drink for those who are overcome by weariness in the waste land
Sa  And the king said And where is your masters son And Ziba said He is still at Jerusalem for he said Today Israel will give back to me the kingdom of my father
Sa  Then the king said to Ziba Truly everything which was Mephibosheths is yours And Ziba said I give honour to my lord may I have grace in your eyes my lord O king
Sa  And when King David came to Bahurim a man of Sauls family named Shimei the son of Gera came out from there calling curses after him
Sa  And he sent stones at David and at all the kings servants and at all the people and at all the men of war by his side on the right hand and on the left
Sa  And Shimei said with curses Be gone be gone you man of blood you goodfornothing
Sa  The Lord has sent punishment on you for all the blood of the family of Saul whose kingdom you have taken and the Lord has given the kingdom to Absalom your son now you yourself are taken in your evil because you are a man of blood
Sa  Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king Is this dead dog to go on cursing my lord the king let me go over and take off his head
Sa  And the king said What have I to do with you you sons of Zeruiah Let him go on cursing for the Lord has said Put a curse on David and who then may say Why have you done so
Sa  And David said to Abishai and to all his servants You see how my son the offspring of my body has made designs against my life how much more then may this Benjamite do so Let him be and let him go on cursing for the Lord has given him orders
Sa  It may be that the Lord will take note of my wrongs and give me back good in answer to his cursing of me today
Sa  So David and his men went on their way and Shimei went by the hillside parallel with them cursing and sending stones and dust at him
Sa  And the king and his people came tired to Jordan and took their rest there
Sa  And Absalom and the men of Israel came to Jerusalem and Ahithophel was with him
Sa  Then Hushai the Archite Davids friend came to Absalom and said Long life to the king long life to the king
Sa  And Absalom said Is this your love for your friend why did you not go with your friend
Sa  And Hushai said to Absalom Not so I am for that man whom the Lord and this people and all the men of Israel have taken as king and I will take my place with him
Sa  And more than this where is my place as a servant is it not before his son as I have been your fathers servant so will I be yours
Sa  Then Absalom said to Ahithophel Give your opinion now what are we to do
Sa  And Ahithophel said to Absalom Go in to your fathers women who are here looking after his house then all Israel will have the news that you are hated by your father and the hands of your supporters will be strong
Sa  So they put up the tent for Absalom on the top of the house and Absalom went in to his fathers women before the eyes of all Israel
Sa  In those days the opinions of Ahithophel were valued as highly as if through him a man might get direction from God so were they valued by David as much as by Absalom
Sa  Then Ahithophel said to Absalom Let me take out twelve thousand men and this very night I will go after David
Sa  And I will come up with him when he is tired and feeble and make him full of fear and all the people with him will go in flight and I will make an attack on the king only
Sa  And I will make all the people come back to you as a bride comes back to her husband it is the life of only one man you are going after so all the people will be at peace
Sa  And the saying was pleasing to Absalom and to the responsible men of Israel
Sa  Then Absalom said Now send for Hushai the Archite and let us give ear to what he has to say
Sa  And when Hushai came Absalom said to him This is what Ahithophel has said are we to do as he says if not what is your suggestion
Sa  And Hushai said to Absalom Ahithophels idea is not a good one at this time
Sa  Hushai said further You have knowledge of your father and his men that they are men of war and that their feelings are bitter like those of a bear in the field whose young ones have been taken from her and your father is a man of war and will not take his nights rest with the people
Sa  But he will certainly have taken cover now in some hole or secret place and if some of our people at the first attack are overcome then any hearing of it will say There is destruction among the people who are on Absaloms side
Sa  Then even the strongest whose heart is like the heart of a lion will become like water for all Israel is conscious that your father is a man of war and those who are with him are strong and without fear
Sa  But my suggestion is that all Israel from Dan as far as Beersheba comes together to you a great army like the sands of the sea in number and that you yourself go out among them
Sa  Then we will come on him in some place wherever he may be falling on him as the dew comes on the earth and of him and all the men who are with him not one will get away with his life
Sa  And if he has gone into some town then let all Israel take strong cords to that town and we will have it pulled into the valley till not one small stone is to be seen there
Sa  Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said Hushais suggestion is better than that of Ahithophel For it was the purpose of the Lord to make the wise designs of Ahithophel without effect so that the Lord might send evil on Absalom
Sa  Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar the priests This is the suggestion made by Ahithophel to Absalom and the responsible men of Israel and this is what I said to them
Sa  So now send the news quickly to David and say Do not take your nights rest by the way across the river to the waste land but be certain to go over or the king and all the people with him will come to destruction
Sa  Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were waiting by Enrogel and a servantgirl went from time to time and gave them news and they went with the news to King David for it was not wise for them to let themselves be seen coming into the town
Sa  But a boy saw them and gave word of it to Absalom so the two of them went away quickly and came to the house of a man in Bahurim who had a waterhole in his garden and they went down into it
Sa  And a woman put a cover over the hole and put crushed grain on top of it and no one had any knowledge of it
Sa  And Absaloms servants came to the woman at the house and said Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan And the woman said to them They have gone from here to the stream And after searching for them and seeing nothing of them they went back to Jerusalem
Sa  Then after the servants had gone away they came up out of the waterhole and went to give King David the news and they said Get up and go quickly over the water for such and such are Ahithophels designs against you
Sa  So David and all the people who were with him went up over Jordan when dawn came every one of them had gone over Jordan
Sa  Now when Ahithophel saw that his suggestion was not acted on he got his ass ready and went back to his house to the town where he came from and having put his house in order he put himself to death by hanging so he came to his end and was put in the restingplace of his father
Sa  And David came to Mahanaim And Absalom with all the men of Israel went over Jordan
Sa  And Absalom put Amasa at the head of the army in place of Joab Now Amasa was the son of a man named Ithra the Ishmaelite who had been the lover of Abigail the daughter of Jesse sister of Zeruiah Joabs mother
Sa  And Israel and Absalom put up their tents in the land of Gilead
Sa  Now when David had come to Mahanaim Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah the Ammonite and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim
Sa  Came with beds and basins and pots and grain and meal and all sorts of dry foods
Sa  And honey and butter and sheep and milkcheeses for David and his people for they said This people is in the waste land needing food and drink and rest
Sa  And David had the people who were with him numbered and he put over them captains of thousands and captains of hundreds
Sa  And David sent the people out a third of them under the orders of Joab and a third under the orders of Abishai son of Zeruiah Joabs brother and a third under Ittai the Gittite And the king said to the people And I myself will certainly go out with you
Sa  But the people said It is better for you not to go out for if we are put to flight they will not give a thought to us and if death overtakes half of us it will be nothing to them but you are of more value than ten thousand of us so it is better for you to be ready to come to our help from this town
Sa  And the king said to them I will do whatever seems best to you So the king took his place by the door of the town and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands
Sa  And the king gave orders to Joab and Abishai and Ittai saying Because of me be gentle to the young man Absalom And this order about Absalom was given in the hearing of all the people
Sa  So the people went out into the field against Israel and the fight took place in the woods of Ephraim
Sa  And the people of Israel were overcome there by the servants of David and there was a great destruction that day and twenty thousand men were put to the sword
Sa  And the fighting went on over all the face of the country and the woods were responsible for more deaths than the sword
Sa  And Absalom came across some of Davids men And Absalom was seated on his mule and the mule went under the thick branches of a great tree and his head became fixed in the tree and he was lifted up between earth and heaven and the beast under him went on
Sa  And a certain man saw it and said to Joab I saw Absalom hanging in a tree
Sa  And Joab said to the man who had given him the news If you saw this why did you not put your sword through him and I would have given you ten bits of silver and a band for your robe
Sa  And the man said to Joab Even if you gave me a thousand bits of silver I would not put out my hand against the kings son for in our hearing the king gave orders to you and Abishai and Ittai saying Take care that the young man Absalom is not touched
Sa  And if I had falsely put him to death and nothing may be kept secret from the king you would have had nothing to do with me
Sa  Then Joab said I would have made it safe for you And he took three spears in his hand and put them through Absaloms heart while he was still living in the branches of the tree
Sa  And ten young men servants of Joab came round Absalom and put an end to him
Sa  And Joab had the horn sounded and the people came back from going after Israel for Joab kept them back
Sa  And they took Absaloms body and put it into a great hole in the wood and put a great mass of stones over it and every man of Israel went in flight to his tent
Sa  Now Absalom before his death had put up for himself a pillar in the kings valley naming it after himself for he said I have no son to keep my name in memory and to this day it is named Absaloms pillar
Sa  Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said Let me go and give the king news of how the Lord has done right in his cause against those who took up arms against him
Sa  And Joab said You will take no news today another day you may give him the news but you will take no news today because the kings son is dead
Sa  Then Joab said to the Cushite Go and give the king word of what you have seen And the Cushite making a sign of respect to Joab went off running
Sa  Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said to Joab again Whatever may come of it let me go after the Cushite And Joab said Why have you a desire to go my son seeing that you will get no reward for your news
Sa  Whatever may come of it he said I will go Then he said to him Go So Ahimaaz went running by the lowland road and overtook the Cushite
Sa  Now David was seated between the two town doors and the watchman went up to the roof of the doorways on the wall and lifting up his eyes saw a man running by himself
Sa  And the watchman gave news of it to the king And the king said If he is coming by himself then he has news And the man was travelling quickly and came near
Sa  Then the watchman saw another man running and crying out in the direction of the door he said Here is another man running by himself And the king said He like the other comes with news
Sa  And the watchman said It seems to me that the running of the first is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok And the king said He is a good man and his news will be good
Sa  And Ahimaaz crying out to the king said It is well And falling down before the king with his face to the earth he said May the Lord your God be praised who has given up the men who took up arms against my lord the king
Sa  And the king said Is it well with the young man Absalom And Ahimaaz said in answer When Joab sent me your servant I saw a great outcry going on but I had no knowledge of what it was
Sa  And the king said Get back and take your place here So turning to one side he took his place there
Sa  And then the Cushite came and said I have news for my lord the king today the Lord has done right in your cause against all those who took up arms against you
Sa  And the king said to the Cushite Is the young man Absalom safe And the Cushite said in answer May all the kings haters and those who do evil against the king be as that young man is
Sa  Then the king was much moved and went up into the room over the door weeping and saying O my son Absalom my son my son Absalom if only my life might have been given for yours O Absalom my son my son
Sa  And word was given to Joab that the king was weeping and sorrowing for Absalom
Sa  And the salvation of that day was changed to sorrow for all the people for it was said to the people The king is in bitter grief for his son
Sa  And the people made their way back to the town quietly and secretly as those who are shamed go secretly when they go in flight from the war
Sa  But the king covering his face gave a great cry O my son Absalom O Absalom my son my son
Sa  And Joab came into the house to the king and said Today you have put to shame the faces of all your servants who even now have kept you and your sons and your daughters and your wives and all your women safe from death
Sa  For your haters it seems are dear to you and your friends are hated For you have made it clear that captains and servants are nothing to you and now I see that if Absalom was living and we had all been dead today it would have been right in your eyes
Sa  So get up now and go out and say some kind words to your servants for by the Lord I give you my oath that if you do not go out not one of them will keep with you tonight and that will be worse for you than all the evil which has overtaken you from your earliest years
Sa  Then the king got up and took his seat near the towndoor And word was given to all the people that the king was in the public place and all the people came before the king Now all the men of Israel had gone back in flight to their tents
Sa  And through all the tribes of Israel the people were having arguments saying The king made us safe from the hands of those who were against us and made us free from the hands of the Philistines and now he has gone in flight from the land because of Absalom
Sa  And Absalom whom we made a ruler over us is dead in the fight So now why do you say nothing about getting the king back And word of what all Israel was saying came to the king
Sa  And King David sent word to Zadok and Abiathar the priests Say to the responsible men of Judah Why are you the last to take steps to get the king back to his house
Sa  You are my brothers my bone and my flesh why are you the last to get the king back again
Sa  And say to Amasa Are you not my bone and my flesh May Gods punishment be on me if I do not make you chief of the army before me at all times in place of Joab
Sa  And the hearts of the men of Judah were moved like one man so that they sent to the king saying Come back with all your servants
Sa  So the king came back and came as far as Jordan And Judah came to Gilgal meeting the king there to take him back with them over Jordan
Sa  And Shimei the son of Gera the Benjamite from Bahurim got up quickly and went down with the men of Judah for the purpose of meeting King David
Sa  And with him a thousand men of Benjamin and Ziba the servant of Saul with his fifteen sons and twenty servants came rushing to Jordan before the king
Sa  And kept going across the river to take the people of the kings house over and to do whatever was desired by the king And Shimei the son of Gera went down on his face in the dust before the king when he was about to go over Jordan
Sa  And said to him Let me not be judged as a sinner in your eyes O my lord and do not keep in mind the wrong I did on the day when my lord the king went out of Jerusalem or take it to heart
Sa  For your servant is conscious of his sin and so as you see I have come today the first of all the sons of Joseph for the purpose of meeting my lord the king
Sa  But Abishai the son of Zeruiah said Is not death the right fate for Shimei because he has been cursing the one marked by the holy oil
Sa  And David said What have I to do with you you sons of Zeruiah that you put yourselves against me today is it right for any man in Israel to be put to death today for I am certain today that I am king in Israel
Sa  So the king said to Shimei You will not be put to death And the king gave him his oath
Sa  And Mephibosheth the son of Sauls son came down for the purpose of meeting the king his feet had not been cared for or his hair cut or his clothing washed from the day when the king went away till the day when he came back in peace
Sa  Now when he had come from Jerusalem to see the king the king said to him Why did you not come with me Mephibosheth
Sa  And he said in answer Because of the deceit of my servant my lord king for I your servant said to him You are to make ready an ass and on it I will go with the king for your servant has not the use of his feet
Sa  He has given you a false account of me but my lord the king is like the angel of God do then whatever seems good to you
Sa  For all my fathers family were only dead men before my lord the king and still you put your servant among those whose place is at the kings table What right then have I to say anything more to the king
Sa  And the king said Say nothing more about these things I say Let there be a division of the land between Ziba and you
Sa  And Mephibosheth said Let him take it all now that my lord the king has come back to his house in peace
Sa  And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim and he went on as far as Jordan with the king to take him across Jordan
Sa  Now Barzillai was a very old man as much as eighty years old and he had given the king everything he had need of while he was at Mahanaim for he was a very great man
Sa  And the king said to Barzillai Come over with me and I will take care of you in Jerusalem
Sa  And Barzillai said to the king How much of my life is still before me for me to go up to Jerusalem with the king
Sa  I am now eighty years old good and bad are the same to me have meat and drink any taste for me now am I able to take pleasure in the voices of men or women in song why then am I to be a trouble to my lord the king
Sa  Your servants desire was only to take the king over Jordan why is the king to give me such a reward
Sa  Let your servant now go back again so that when death comes to me it may be in my town and by the restingplace of my father and mother But here is your servant Chimham let him go with my lord the king and do for him what seems good to you
Sa  And the king said in answer Let Chimham go over with me and I will do for him whatever seems good to you and whatever your desire is I will do it for you
Sa  Then all the people went over Jordan and the king went over and the king gave Barzillai a kiss with his blessing and he went back to his place
Sa  So the king went over to Gilgal and Chimham went with him and all the people of Judah as well as half the people of Israel took the king on his way
Sa  Then the men of Israel came to the king and said Why have our countrymen of Judah taken you away in secret and come over Jordan with the king and all his family because all his people are Davids men
Sa  And all the men of Judah gave this answer to the men of Israel Because the king is our near relation why then are you angry about this have we taken any of the kings food or has he given us any offering
Sa  And in answer to the men of Judah the men of Israel said We have ten parts in the king and we are the first in order of birth why did you make nothing of us and were we not the first to make suggestions for getting the king back And the words of the men of Judah were more violent than the words of the men of Israel
Sa  Now by chance there was present a goodfornothing person named Sheba the son of Bichri a Benjamite and he sounding the horn said We have no part in David or any interest in the son of Jesse let every man go to his tent O Israel
Sa  So all the men of Israel turning away from David went after Sheba the son of Bichri but the men of Judah were true to their king going with him from Jordan as far as Jerusalem
Sa  And David came to his house at Jerusalem and the king took the ten women to whom he had given the care of the house and had them shut up and gave them the necessaries of life but did not go near them So they were shut up till the day of their death living as widows
Sa  Then the king said to Amasa Get all the men of Judah together and in three days be here yourself
Sa  So Amasa went to get all the men of Judah together but he took longer than the time David had given him
Sa  And David said to Abishai Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more damage than Absalom did so take some of your lords servants and go after him before he makes himself safe in the walled towns and gets away before our eyes
Sa  So there went after Abishai Joab and the Cherethites and the Pelethites and all the fightingmen they went out of Jerusalem to overtake Sheba the son of Bichri
Sa  When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon Amasa came face to face with them Now Joab had on his wardress and round him a band from which his sword was hanging in its cover and while he was walking it came out falling to the earth
Sa  And Joab said to Amasa Is it well my brother And with his right hand he took him by the hair of his chin to give him a kiss
Sa  But Amasa did not see danger from the sword which was now in Joabs left hand and Joab put it through his stomach so that his inside came out on to the earth and he did not give him another blow So Joab and his brother Abishai went on after Sheba the son of Bichri
Sa  And one of Joabs young men taking his place at Amasas side said Whoever is for Joab and for David let him go after Joab
Sa  And Amasa was stretched out in a pool of blood in the middle of the highway And when the man saw that all the people were stopping he took Amasa out of the highway and put him in a field with a cloth over him when he saw that everyone who went by came to a stop
Sa  When he had been taken off the road all the people went on after Joab in search of Sheba the son of Bichri
Sa  And Sheba went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel of Bethmaacah and all the Bichrites came together and went in after him
Sa  And Joab and his men got him shut up in Abel of Bethmaacah and put up an earthwork against the town and all Joabs men did their best to get the wall broken down
Sa  Then a wise woman got up on the wall and crying out from the town said Give ear give ear say now to Joab Come near so that I may have talk with you
Sa  And he came near and the woman said Are you Joab And he said in answer I am Then she said Give ear to your servants words And he said I am giving ear
Sa  Then she said In the old days there was a saying Let them put the question in Abel and in Dan saying Has what was ordered by men of good faith in Israel ever come to an end
Sa  Your purpose is the destruction of a mothertown in Israel why would you put an end to the heritage of the Lord
Sa  And Joab answering her said Far far be it from me to be a cause of death or destruction
Sa  Not so but a man of the hillcountry of Ephraim Sheba son of Bichri by name has taken up arms against the king against David give up this man only and I will go away from the town And the woman said to Joab His head will be dropped over the wall to you
Sa  Then the woman in her wisdom had talk with all the town And they had Shebas head cut off and sent out to Joab And he had the horn sounded and sent them all away from the town every man to his tent And Joab went back to Jerusalem to the king
Sa  Now Joab was over all the army and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was at the head of the Cherethites and the Pelethites
Sa  And Adoram was overseer of the forced work and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder
Sa  And Sheva was the scribe and Zadok and Abiathar were priests
Sa  And in addition Ira the Jairite was a priest to David
Sa  In the days of David they were short of food for three years year after year and David went before the Lord for directions And the Lord said On Saul and on his family there is blood because he put the Gibeonites to death
Sa  Then the king sent for the Gibeonites now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel but were the last of the Amorites to whom the children of Israel had given an oath but Saul in his passion for the children of Israel and Judah had made an attempt on their lives
Sa  So David said to the Gibeonites What may I do for you how am I to make up to you for your wrongs so that you may give a blessing to the heritage of the Lord
Sa  And the Gibeonites said to him It is not a question of silver and gold between us and Saul or his family and it is not in our power to put to death any man in Israel And he said Say then what am I to do for you
Sa  And they said to the king As for the man by whom we were wasted and who made designs against us to have us completely cut off from the land of Israel
Sa  Let seven men of his family be given up to us and we will put an end to them by hanging them before the Lord in Gibeon on the hill of the Lord And the king said I will give them
Sa  But the king did not give up Mephibosheth the son of Sauls son Jonathan because of the Lords oath made between David and Jonathan the son of Saul
Sa  But the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth the two sons of Saul to whom Rizpah the daughter of Aiah had given birth and the five sons of Sauls daughter Merab whose father was Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite
Sa  And he gave them up to the Gibeonites and they put them to death hanging them on the mountain before the Lord all seven came to their end together in the first days of the graincutting at the start of the cutting of the barley
Sa  And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took haircloth placing it on the rock as a bed for herself from the start of the graincutting till rain came down on them from heaven and she did not let the birds of the air come near them by day or the beasts of the field by night
Sa  And news was given to David of what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah one of Sauls wives had done
Sa  And David went and took the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from the men of Jabeshgilead who had taken them away secretly from the public place of Bethshan where the Philistines had put them hanging up the bodies there on the day when they put Saul to death in Gilboa
Sa  And he took the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from that place and they got together the bones of those who had been put to death by hanging
Sa  And they put them with the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the restingplace of Kish his father in Zela in the country of Benjamin they did all the king had given them orders to do And after that God gave ear to their prayers for the land
Sa  And the Philistines went to war again with Israel and David went down with his people and while they were at Gob they had a fight with the Philistines
Sa  And there came against David one of the offspring of the Rephaim whose spear was three hundred shekels of brass in weight and having a new sword he made an attempt to put David to death
Sa  But Abishai the son of Zeruiah came to his help and turning on the Philistine gave him his deathblow Then Davids men took an oath and said Never again are you to go out with us to the fight so that you may not put out the light of Israel
Sa  Now after this there was war with the Philistines again at Gob and Sibbecai the Hushathite put to death Saph one of the offspring of the Rephaim
Sa  And again there was war with the Philistines at Gob and Elhanan the son of Jair the Bethlehemite put to death Goliath the Gittite the stem of whose spear was like a clothworkers rod
Sa  And again there was war at Gath where there was a very tall man who had twentyfour fingers and toes six fingers on his hands and six toes on his feet he was one of the offspring of the Rephaim
Sa  And when he was purposing to put shame on Israel Jonathan the son of Shimei Davids brother put him to death
Sa  These four were of the offspring of the Rephaim in Gath and they came to their end by the hands of David and his servants
Sa  And David made a song to the Lord in these words on the day when the Lord made him free from the hands of all his haters and from the hand of Saul
Sa  And he said The Lord is my Rock my walled town and my saviour even mine
Sa  My God my Rock in him will I put my faith my breastplate and the horn of my salvation my high tower and my safe place my saviour who keeps me safe from the violent man
Sa  I will send up my cry to the Lord who is to be praised so will I be made safe from those who are against me
Sa  For the waves of death came round me and the seas of evil put me in fear
Sa  The cords of hell were round me the nets of death came on me
Sa  In my trouble my voice went up to the Lord and my cry to my God my voice came to his hearing in his holy Temple and my prayer came to his ears
Sa  Then the earth was moved with a violent shock the bases of heaven were moved and shaking because he was angry
Sa  There went up a smoke from his nose and a fire of destruction from his mouth coals were lighted by it
Sa  The heavens were bent so that he might come down and it was dark under his feet
Sa  And he went through the air seated on a stormcloud going quickly on the wings of the wind
Sa  And he made the dark his tent round him a mass of waters thick clouds of the skies
Sa  Before his shining light his dark clouds went past raining ice and coals of fire
Sa  The Lord made thunder in the heavens and the voice of the Highest was sounding out
Sa  And he sent out his arrows driving them in all directions by his flames of fire they were troubled
Sa  Then the deep beds of the sea were seen and the bases of the world were uncovered because of the Lords wrath because of the breath of his mouth
Sa  He sent from on high he took me pulling me out of great waters
Sa  He made me free from my strong hater from those who were against me because they were stronger than I
Sa  They came on me in the day of my trouble but the Lord was my support
Sa  He took me out into a wide place he was my saviour because he had delight in me
Sa  The Lord gives me the reward of my righteousness because my hands are clean before him
Sa  For I have kept the ways of the Lord I have not been turned away in sin from my God
Sa  For all his decisions were before me and I did not put away his laws from me
Sa  And I was upright before him and I kept myself from sin
Sa  Because of this the Lord has given me the reward of my righteousness because my hands are clean in his eyes
Sa  On him who has mercy you will have mercy to the upright you will be upright
Sa  He who is holy will see that you are holy but to the man whose way is not straight you will be a hard judge
Sa  For you are the saviour of those who are in trouble but your eyes are on men of pride to make them low
Sa  For you are my light O Lord and the Lord will make the dark bright for me
Sa  By your help I have made a way through the wall which was shutting me in by the help of my God I have gone over a wall
Sa  As for God his way is all good the word of the Lord is tested he is a safe cover for all those who put their faith in him
Sa  For who is God but the Lord and who is a Rock but our God
Sa  God puts a strong band about me guiding me in a straight way
Sa  He makes my feet like roes feet and puts me on high places
Sa  He makes my hands expert in war so that a bow of brass is bent by my arms
Sa  You have given me the breastplate of your salvation and your mercy has made me great
Sa  You have made my steps wide under me so that my feet make no slip
Sa  I go after my haters and overtake them not turning back till they are all overcome
Sa  I have sent destruction on them and given them wounds so that they are not able to get up they are stretched under my feet
Sa  For I have been armed by you with strength for the fight you have made low under me those who came out against me
Sa  By you their backs are turned in flight so that my haters are cut off
Sa  They were crying out but there was no one to come to their help even to the Lord but he gave them no answer
Sa  Then they were crushed as small as the dust of the earth stamped down under my feet like the waste of the streets
Sa  You have made me free from the fightings of my people you have made me the head of the nations a people of whom I had no knowledge will be my servants
Sa  Men of other countries will with false hearts put themselves under my authority from the time when my name comes to their ears they will be ruled by me
Sa  They will be wasted away they will come out of their secret places shaking with fear
Sa  The Lord is living praise be to my Rock and let the God of my salvation be honoured
Sa  It is God who sends punishment on my haters and puts peoples under my rule
Sa  He makes me free from my haters I am lifted up over those who come up against me you have made me free from the violent man
Sa  Because of this I will give you praise O Lord among the nations and will make a song of praise to your name
Sa  Great salvation does he give to his king he has mercy on the king of his selection David and on his seed for ever
Sa  Now these are the last words of David David the son of Jesse says the man who was lifted up on high the man on whom the God of Jacob put the holy oil the loved one of Israels songs says
Sa  The spirit of the Lord had voice through me his word was on my tongue
Sa  The God of Israel said the word of the Rock of Israel came to me When an upright king is ruling over men when he is ruling in the fear of God
Sa  It is as the light of the morning when the sun comes up a morning without clouds making young grass come to life from the earth
Sa  For is not my house so with God For he has made with me an eternal agreement ordered in all things and certain as for all my salvation and all my desire will he not give it increase
Sa  But the evildoers all of them will be like thorns to be pushed away because they may not be gripped in the hand
Sa  But anyone touching them has to be armed with iron and the rod of a spear and they will be burned with fire every one of them
Sa  These are the names of Davids men of war Ishbaal the Hachmonite chief of the three his axe was lifted up against eight hundred put to death at one time
Sa  After him was Eleazar the son of Dodai the Ahohite one of the three great fighters who was with David in Pasdammim when the Philistines came together there for the fight and when the men of Israel had gone in flight
Sa  He was with David and went on fighting the Philistines till his hand became tired and stiff from gripping his sword and that day the Lord gave a great salvation and the people came back after him only to take the goods of the Philistines
Sa  After him was Shammah the son of Ela the Hararite And the Philistines came together in Lehi where there was a bit of land full of seed and the people went in flight from the Philistines
Sa  But he kept his place in the middle of the bit of land and kept back their attack and overcame the Philistines and the Lord gave a great salvation
Sa  And three of the thirty went down at the start of the graincutting and they came to David at the strong place of Adullam and the band of Philistines had taken up their position in the valley of Rephaim
Sa  And at that time David had taken cover in the strong place and an armed force of the Philistines was in Bethlehem
Sa  And David moved by a strong desire said If only someone would give me a drink of water from the waterhole of Bethlehem by the doorway into the town
Sa  And the three men forcing their way through the Philistine army got water from the waterhole of Bethlehem by the doorway into the town and took it back to David but he would not take it but draining it out made an offering of it to the Lord
Sa  And he said Far be it from me O Lord to do this how may I take as my drink the lifeblood of men who have put their lives in danger So he would not take it These things did the three great men of war
Sa  And Abishai the brother of Joab the son of Zeruiah was chief of the thirty He put to death three hundred with his spear and he got for himself a name among the thirty
Sa  Was he not the noblest of the thirty so he was made their captain but he was not equal to the first three
Sa  And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada a fighting man of Kabzeel had done great acts he put to death the two sons of Ariel of Moab he went down into a hole and put a lion to death in time of snow
Sa  And he made an attack on an Egyptian a tall man and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand but he went down to him with a stick and pulling the spear out of the hands of the Egyptian put him to death with that same spear
Sa  These were the acts of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada who had a great name among the thirty men of war
Sa  He was honoured over the rest of the thirty but he was not equal to the first three And David put him over the fighting men who kept him safe
Sa  Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty and Elhanan the son of Dodai of Bethlehem
Sa  Shammah the Harodite Elika the Harodite
Sa  Helez the Paltite Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite
Sa  Abiezer the Anathothite Sibbecai the Hushathite
Sa  Zalmon the Ahohite Maharai the Netophathite
Sa  Heldai the son of Baanah the Netophathite Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin
Sa  Benaiah the Pirathonite Hiddai of the valleys of Gaash
Sa  Abiel the Arbathite Azmaveth of Bahurim
Sa  Eliahba the Shaalbonite Jashen the Gunite
Sa  Jonathan the son of Shammah the Hararite Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite
Sa  Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai the Maacathite Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite
Sa  Hezrai the Carmelite Paarai the Archite
Sa  Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah Bani the Gadite
Sa  Zelek the Ammonite Naharai the Beerothite who had the care of the arms of Joab son of Zeruiah
Sa  Ira the Ithrite Gareb the Ithrite
Sa  Uriah the Hittite thirtyseven in number
Sa  Again the wrath of the Lord was burning against Israel and moving David against them he said Go take the number of Israel and Judah
Sa  And the king said to Joab and the captains of the army who were with him Go now through all the tribes of Israel from Dan as far as Beersheba and have all the people numbered so that I may be certain of the number of the people
Sa  And Joab said to the king Whatever the number of the people may the Lord make it a hundred times as much and may the eyes of my lord the king see it but why does my lord the king take pleasure in doing this thing
Sa  But the kings order was stronger than Joab and the captains of the army And Joab and the captains of the army went out from the king to take the number of the children of Israel
Sa  And they went over Jordan and starting from Aroer from the town which is in the middle of the valley they went in the direction of the Gadites and on to Jazer
Sa  Then they came to Gilead and to the land of the Hittites under Hermon and they came to Dan and from Dan they came round to Zidon
Sa  And to the walled town of Tyre and to all the towns of the Hivites and the Canaanites and they went out to the South of Judah at Beersheba
Sa  So after going through all the land in every direction they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days
Sa  And Joab gave the king the number of all the people there were in Israel eight hundred thousand fighting men able to take up arms and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand
Sa  And after the people had been numbered Davids heart was troubled And David said to the Lord Great has been my sin in doing this but now O Lord be pleased to take away the sin of your servant for I have done very foolishly
Sa  And David got up in the morning now the word of the Lord had come to the prophet Gad Davids seer saying
Sa  Go and say to David The Lord says Three things are offered to you say which of them you will have and I will do it to you
Sa  So Gad came to David and gave him word of this and said to him Are there to be three years when there is not enough food in your land or will you go in flight from your haters for three months while they go after you or will you have three days of violent disease in your land take thought and say what answer I am to give to him who sent me
Sa  And David said to Gad This is a hard decision for me to make let us come into the hands of the Lord for great are his mercies let me not come into the hands of men
Sa  So David made selection of the disease and the time was the days of the graincutting when the disease came among the people causing the death of seventy thousand men from Dan as far as Beersheba
Sa  And when the hand of the angel was stretched out in the direction of Jerusalem for its destruction the Lord had regret for the evil and said to the angel who was sending destruction on the people It is enough do no more And the angel of the Lord was by the grainfloor of Araunah the Jebusite
Sa  And when David saw the angel who was causing the destruction of the people he said to the Lord Truly the sin is mine I have done wrong but these are only sheep what have they done let your hand be against me and against my family
Sa  And that day Gad came to David and said to him Go up and put up an altar to the Lord on the grainfloor of Araunah the Jebusite
Sa  So David went up as Gad had said and as the Lord had given orders
Sa  And Araunah looking out saw the king and his servants coming to him and Araunah went out and went down on his face to the earth before the king
Sa  And Araunah said Why has my lord the king come to his servant And David said To give you a price for your grainfloor so that I may put up an altar to the Lord and the disease may be stopped among the people
Sa  And Araunah said to David Let my lord the king take whatever seems right to him and make an offering of it see here are the oxen for the burned offering and the graincleaning instruments and the oxyokes for wood
Sa  All this does the servant of my lord the king give to the king And Araunah said May the Lord your God be pleased with your offering
Sa  And the king said to Araunah No but I will give you a price for it I will not give to the Lord my God burned offerings for which I have given nothing So David got the grainfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver
Sa  And there David put up an altar to the Lord making burned offerings and peaceofferings So the Lord gave ear to his prayer for the land and the disease came to an end in Israel
Ki  Now King David was old and far on in years and though they put covers over him his body was cold
Ki  So his servants said to him Let search be made for a young virgin for my lord the king to take care of him and be waiting on him and you may take her in your arms and so my lord the king will be warm
Ki  So after searching through all the land of Israel for a fair young girl they saw Abishag the Shunammite and took her to the king
Ki  Now she was very beautiful and she took care of the king waiting on him at all times but the king had no connection with her
Ki  Then Adonijah the son of Haggith lifting himself up in pride said I will become king and he made ready his carriages of war and his horsemen with fifty runners to go before him
Ki  Now all his life his father had never gone against him or said to him Why have you done so and he was a very goodlooking man and younger than Absalom
Ki  And he had talk with Joab the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest and they were on his side and gave him their support
Ki  But Zadok the priest and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and Nathan the prophet and Shimei and Rei and Davids men of war did not take the side of Adonijah
Ki  Then Adonijah put to death sheep and oxen and fat beasts by the stone of Zoheleth by Enrogel and he sent for all his brothers the kings sons and all the men of Judah the kings servants to come to him
Ki  But he did not send for Nathan the prophet and Benaiah and the other men of war and Solomon his brother
Ki  Then Nathan said to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon Has it not come to your ears that Adonijah the son of Haggith has made himself king without the knowledge of David our lord
Ki  So now let me make a suggestion so that you may keep your life safe and the life of your son Solomon
Ki  Come now go to King David and say to him Did you not O my lord take an oath to me your servant saying Truly Solomon your son will be king after me seated on the seat of my kingdom why then is Adonijah acting as king
Ki  And while you are still talking there with the king see I will come in after you and say that your story is true
Ki  Then Bathsheba went into the kings room now the king was very old and Abishag the Shunammite was waiting on him
Ki  And Bathsheba went down on her face on the earth before the king giving him honour And he said What is your desire
Ki  And she said to him My lord you took an oath by the Lord your God and gave your word to your servant saying Truly Solomon your son will be king after me seated on the seat of my kingdom
Ki  And now see Adonijah has made himself king without my lords knowledge
Ki  And has put to death oxen and fat beasts and sheep in great numbers and has sent for all the sons of the king and Abiathar the priest and Joab the captain of the army but he has not sent for Solomon your servant
Ki  And now my lord the king the eyes of all Israel are on you waiting for you to say who is to take the place of my lord the king after him
Ki  For as things are it will come about when my lord the king is sleeping with his fathers that I and Solomon my son will be made outlaws
Ki  And while she was still talking with the king Nathan the prophet came in
Ki  And they said to the king Here is Nathan the prophet And when he came in before the king he went down on his face on the earth
Ki  And Nathan said O my lord king have you said Adonijah is to be king after me seated on the seat of my kingdom
Ki  Because today he has gone down and has put to death oxen and fat beasts and sheep in great numbers and has sent for all the kings sons to come to him with the captains of the army and Abiathar the priest and they are feasting before him and crying Long life to King Adonijah
Ki  But me your servant and Zadok the priest and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and your servant Solomon he has not sent for
Ki  Has this thing been done by my lord the king without giving word to your servants who was to be placed on my lord the kings seat after him
Ki  Then King David in answer said Send for Bathsheba to come to me And she came in and took her place before the king
Ki  And the king took an oath and said By the living Lord who has been my saviour from all my troubles
Ki  As I took an oath to you by the Lord the God of Israel saying Certainly Solomon your son will become king after me seated on my seat in my place so will I do this day
Ki  Then Bathsheba went down on her face on the earth before the king giving him honour and said May my lord King David go on living for ever
Ki  And King David said Send for Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada And they came before the king
Ki  And the king said to them Take with you the servants of your lord and put Solomon my son on my beast yes mine and take him down to Gihon
Ki  And there let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet put the holy oil on him to make him king over Israel and sounding the horn say Long life to King Solomon
Ki  Then come up after him and he will come in and take his place on the seat of my kingdom for he is to be king in my place and I have given orders that he is to be ruler over Israel and over Judah
Ki  And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answering the king said So be it and may the Lord the God of my lord the king say so
Ki  As the Lord has been with my lord the king even so may he be with Solomon and make the seat of his authority greater than that of my lord King David
Ki  So Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and the Cherethites and the Pelethites went down and put Solomon on King Davids beast and took him to Gihon
Ki  And Zadok the priest took the vessel of oil out of the Tent and put the holy oil on Solomon And when the horn was sounded all the people said Long life to King Solomon
Ki  And all the people came up after him piping with pipes and they were glad with great joy so that the earth was shaking with the sound
Ki  And it came to the ears of Adonijah and all the guests who were with him when their meal was ended And Joab hearing the sound of the horn said What is the reason of this noise as if the town was worked up
Ki  And while the words were on his lips Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came and Adonijah said Come in for you are a man of good faith and the news which you have for us will be good
Ki  And Jonathan answering said to Adonijah Not so but our lord King David has made Solomon king
Ki  And he sent with him Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and the Cherethites and the Pelethites and they put him on the kings beast
Ki  And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet put the holy oil on him and made him king in Gihon and they came back from there with joy and the town was all worked up This is the noise which has come to your ears
Ki  And now Solomon is seated on the seat of the kingdom
Ki  And the kings servants came to our lord King David blessing him and saying May God make the name of Solomon better than your name and the seat of his authority greater than your seat and the king was bent low in worship on his bed
Ki  Then the king said May the God of Israel be praised who has given one of my seed to be king in my place this day and has let my eyes see it
Ki  And all the guests of Adonijah got up in fear and went away every man to his place
Ki  And Adonijah himself was full of fear because of Solomon and he got up and went to the altar and put his hands on its horns
Ki  And they gave Solomon word of it saying See Adonijah goes in such fear of King Solomon that he has put his hands on the horns of the altar saying Let King Solomon first give me his oath that he will not put his servant to death with the sword
Ki  And Solomon said If he is seen to be a man of good faith not a hair of him will be touched but if any wrongdoing is seen in him he is to be put to death
Ki  So King Solomon sent and they took him down from the altar And he came and gave honour to King Solomon and Solomon said to him Go to your house
Ki  Now the time of Davids death came near and he gave orders to Solomon his son saying
Ki  I am going the way of all the earth so be strong and be a man
Ki  And keep the orders of the Lord your God walking in his ways keeping his laws and his orders and his rules and his words as they are recorded in the law of Moses so that you may do well in all you do and wherever you go
Ki  So that the Lord may give effect to what he said of me If your children give attention to their ways living uprightly before me with all their heart and their soul you will never be without a man to be king in Israel
Ki  Now you have knowledge of what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me and to the two captains of the army of Israel Abner the son of Ner and Amasa the son of Jether whom he put to death taking payment for the blood of war in time of peace and making the band of my clothing and the shoes on my feet red with the blood of one put to death without cause
Ki  So be guided by your wisdom and let not his white head go down to the underworld in peace
Ki  But be good to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite and let them be guests at your table for so they came to me when I went in flight from Absalom your brother
Ki  Now you have with you Shimei the son of Gera the Benjamite of Bahurim who put a bitter curse on me on the day when I went to Mahanaim but he came down to see me at Jordan and I gave him my oath by the Lord saying I will not put you to death by the sword
Ki  But do not let him be free from punishment for you are a wise man and it will be clear to you what you have to do with him see that his white head goes down to the underworld in blood
Ki  Then David went to rest with his fathers and his body was put into the earth in the town of David
Ki  David was king over Israel for forty years for seven years he was king in Hebron and for thirtythree years in Jerusalem
Ki  And Solomon took his place on the seat of David his father and his kingdom was made safe and strong
Ki  Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon And she said Come you in peace And he said Yes in peace
Ki  Then he said I have something to say to you And she said Say on
Ki  And he said You saw how the kingdom was mine and all Israel had the idea that I would be their king but now the kingdom is turned about and has become my brothers for it was given to him by the Lord
Ki  Now I have one request to make to you and do not say No to me And she said to him Say on
Ki  Then he said Will you go to Solomon the king for he will not say No to you and put before him my request that he will give me Abishag the Shunammite for a wife
Ki  And Bathsheba said Good I will make your request to the king
Ki  So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to have talk with him on Adonijahs account And the king got up to come to her and went down low to the earth before her then he took his place on the kings seat and had a seat made ready for the kings mother and she took her place at his right hand
Ki  Then she said I have one small request to make to you do not say No to me And the king said Say on my mother for I will not say No to you
Ki  And she said Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother for a wife
Ki  Then King Solomon made answer and said to his mother Why are you requesting me to give Abishag the Shunammite to Adonijah Take the kingdom for him in addition for he is my older brother and Abiathar the priest and Joab the son of Zeruiah are on his side
Ki  Then King Solomon took an oath by the Lord saying May Gods punishment be on me if Adonijah does not give payment for these words with his life
Ki  Now by the living Lord who has given me my place on the seat of David my father and made me one of a line of kings as he gave me his word truly Adonijah will be put to death this day
Ki  And King Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and he made an attack on him and put him to death
Ki  And to Abiathar the priest the king said Go to Anathoth to your fields for death would be your right reward but I will not put you to death now because you took up the ark of the Lord God before David my father and you were with him in all his troubles
Ki  So Solomon let Abiathar be priest no longer so that he might make the word of the Lord come true which he said about the sons of Eli in Shiloh
Ki  And news of this came to Joab for Joab had been one of Adonijahs supporters though he had not been on Absaloms side Then Joab went in flight to the Tent of the Lord and put his hands on the horns of the altar
Ki  And they said to King Solomon Joab has gone in flight to the Tent of the Lord and is by the altar Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada saying Go make an attack on him
Ki  And Benaiah came to the Tent of the Lord and said to him The king says Come out And he said No but let death come to me here And Benaiah went back to the king and gave him word of the answer which Joab had given
Ki  And the king said Do as he has said and make an attack on him there and put his body into the earth so that you may take away from me and from my family the blood of one put to death by Joab without cause
Ki  And the Lord will send back his blood on his head because of the attack he made on two men more upright and better than himself putting them to the sword without my fathers knowledge even Abner the son of Ner captain of the army of Israel and Amasa the son of Jether captain of the army of Judah
Ki  So their blood will be on the head of Joab and on the head of his seed for ever but for David and his seed and his family and the seat of his kingdom there will be peace for ever from the Lord
Ki  So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and falling on him put him to death and his body was put to rest in his house in the waste land
Ki  And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the army and Zadok the priest he put in the place of Abiathar
Ki  Then the king sent for Shimei and said to him Make a house for yourself in Jerusalem and keep there and go to no other place
Ki  For be certain that on the day when you go out and go over the stream Kidron death will overtake you and your blood will be on your head
Ki  And Shimei said to the king Very well as my lord the king has said so will your servant do And for a long time Shimei went on living in Jerusalem
Ki  But after three years two of the servants of Shimei went in flight to Achish son of Maacah king of Gath And word was given to Shimei that his servants had gone to Gath
Ki  Then Shimei got up and making ready his ass he went to Gath to Achish in search of his servants and he sent and got them from Gath
Ki  And news was given to Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had come back again
Ki  Then the king sent for Shimei and said to him Did I not make you take an oath by the Lord protesting to you and saying Be certain that on the day when you go out from here wherever you go death will overtake you and you said to me Very well
Ki  Why then have you not kept the oath of the Lord and the order which I gave you
Ki  And the king said to Shimei You have knowledge of all the evil which you did to David my father and now the Lord has sent back your evil on yourself
Ki  But a blessing will be on King Solomon and the kingdom of David will keep its place before the Lord for ever
Ki  So the king gave orders to Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and he went out and falling on him put him to death And Solomons authority over the kingdom was complete
Ki  Solomon became the soninlaw of Pharaoh king of Egypt and took Pharaohs daughter as his wife keeping her in the town of David till the house he was building for himself and the house of the Lord and the wall round Jerusalem were complete
Ki  But all this time the people were making their offerings in the high places because no house had been put up to the name of the Lord till those days
Ki  And Solomon in his love for the Lord kept the laws of David his father but he made offerings and let them go up in smoke on the high places
Ki  And the king went to Gibeon to make an offering there because that was the chief high place it was Solomons way to make a thousand burned offerings on that altar
Ki  In Gibeon Solomon had a vision of the Lord in a dream by night and God said to him Say what I am to give you
Ki  And Solomon said Great was your mercy to David my father as his life before you was true and upright and his heart was true to you and you have kept for him this greatest mercy a son to take his place this day
Ki  And now O Lord my God you have made your servant king in the place of David my father and I am only a young boy with no knowledge of how to go out or come in
Ki  And your servant has round him the people of your selection a people so great that they may not be numbered and no account of them may be given
Ki  Give your servant then a wise heart for judging your people able to see what is good and what evil for who is able to be the judge of this great people
Ki  Now these words and Solomons request were pleasing to the Lord
Ki  And God said to him Because your request is for this thing and not for long life for yourself or for wealth or for the destruction of your haters but for wisdom to be a judge of causes
Ki  I have done as you said I have given you a wise and farseeing heart so that there has never been your equal in the past and never will there be any like you in the future
Ki  And with this I have given you what you made no request for wealth and honour so that no king was ever your equal
Ki  And if you go on in my ways keeping my laws and my orders as your father David did I will give you a long life
Ki  And Solomon awakening saw that it was a dream then he came to Jerusalem where he went before the ark of the agreement of the Lord offering burned offerings and peaceofferings and he made a feast for all his servants
Ki  Then two loose women of the town came and took their places before the king
Ki  And one of them said O my lord I and this woman are living in the same house and I gave birth to a child by her side in the house
Ki  And three days after the birth of my child this woman had a child we were together no otherperson was with us in the house but we two only
Ki  In the night this woman sleeping on her child was the cause of its death
Ki  And she got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while your servant was sleeping and she took it in her arms and put her dead child in my arms
Ki  And when I got up to give my child the breast I saw that it was dead but in the morning looking at it with care I saw that it was not my son
Ki  And the other woman said No but the living child is my son and the dead one yours But the first said No the dead child is your son and the living one mine So they kept on talking before the king
Ki  Then the king said One says The living child is my son and yours is the dead and the other says Not so but your son is the dead one and mine is the living
Ki  Then he said Get me a sword So they went and put a sword before the king
Ki  And the king said Let the living child be cut in two and one half given to one woman and one to the other
Ki  Then the mother of the living child came forward for her heart went out to her son and she said O my lord give her the child do not on any account put it to death But the other woman said It will not be mine or yours let it be cut in two
Ki  Then the king made answer and said Give her the child and do not put it to death she is the mother of it
Ki  And news of this decision which the king had made went through all Israel and they had fear of the king for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to give decisions
Ki  Now Solomon was king over all Israel
Ki  And these were his chief men Azariah the son of Zadok was the priest
Ki  Elihoreph and Ahijah the sons of Shisha were scribes Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder
Ki  Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was head of the army Zadok and Abiathar were priests
Ki  Azariah the son of Nathan was over those in authority in the different divisions of the country Zabud the son of Nathan was priest and the kings friend
Ki  Ahishar was controller of the kings house Adoniram the son of Abda was overseer of the forced work
Ki  And Solomon put twelve overseers over all Israel to be responsible for the stores needed for the king and those of his house every man was responsible for one month in the year
Ki  And these are their names  the son of Hur in the hill country of Ephraim
Ki   the son of Deker in Makaz and Shaalbim and Bethshemesh and Elonbethhanan
Ki   the son of Hesed in Arubboth Socoh and all the land of Hepher were under his control
Ki   the son of Abinadab in all Naphathdor his wife was Taphath the daughter of Solomon
Ki  Baana the son of Ahilud in Taanach and Megiddo and all Bethshean which is by the side of Zarethan under Jezreel from Bethshean to Abelmeholah as far as the far side of Jokmeam
Ki   the son of Geber in Ramothgilead he had the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh which are in Gilead and the country of Argob which is in Bashan sixty great towns with walls and locks of brass
Ki  Ahinadab the son of Iddo in Mahanaim
Ki  Ahimaaz in Naphtali he took Basemath the daughter of Solomon as his wife
Ki  Baana the son of Hushai in Asher and Aloth
Ki  Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah in Issachar
Ki  Shimei the son of Ela in Benjamin
Ki  Geber the son of Uri in the land of Gilead the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and Og king of Bashan and one overseer had authority over all the overseers who were in the land
Ki  Judah and Israel were as great in number as the sand by the seaside and they took their food and drink with joy in their hearts
Ki  And Solomon was ruler over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines and as far as the edge of Egypt men gave him offerings and were his servants all the days of his life
Ki  And the amount of Solomons food for one day was thirty measures of crushed grain and sixty measures of meal
Ki  Ten fat oxen and twenty oxen from the fields and a hundred sheep in addition to harts and gazelles and roes and fat fowls
Ki  For he had authority over all the country on this side of the River from Tiphsah to Gaza over all the kings on this side of the River and he had peace round him on every side
Ki  So Judah and Israel were living safely every man under his vine and his figtree from Dan as far as Beersheba all the days of Solomon
Ki  And Solomon had four thousand boxedoff spaces for horses for his carriages and twelve thousand horsemen
Ki  And those overseers every man in his month saw that food was produced for Solomon and all his guests they took care that nothing was overlooked
Ki  And they took grain and dry grass for the horses and the carriagehorses to the right place every man as he was ordered
Ki  And God gave Solomon a great store of wisdom and good sense and a mind of wide range as wide as the sand by the seaside
Ki  And Solomons wisdom was greater than the wisdom of all the people of the East and all the wisdom of Egypt
Ki  For he was wiser than all men even than Ethan the Ezrahite and Heman and Calcol and Darda the sons of Mahol and he had a great name among all the nations round about
Ki  He was the maker of three thousand wise sayings and of songs to the number of a thousand and five
Ki  He made sayings about all plants from the cedar in Lebanon to the hyssop hanging on the wall and about all beasts and birds and fishes and the small things of the earth
Ki  People came from every nation to give ear to the wisdom of Solomon from all the kings of the earth who had word of his wisdom
Ki  Now Hiram king of Tyre hearing that Solomon had been made king in place of his father sent his servants to him for Hiram had ever been a friend to David
Ki  And Solomon sent back word to Hiram saying
Ki  You have knowledge that David my father was not able to make a house for the name of the Lord his God because of the wars which were round him on every side till the Lord put all those who were against him under his feet
Ki  But now the Lord my God has given me rest on every side no one is making trouble and no evil is taking place
Ki  And so it is my purpose to make a house for the name of the Lord my God as he said to David my father Your son whom I will make king in your place will be the builder of a house for my name
Ki  So now will you have cedartrees from Lebanon cut down for me and my servants will be with your servants and I will give you payment for your servants at whatever rate you say for it is common knowledge that we have no such woodcutters among us as the men of Zidon
Ki  And these words of Solomon made Hiram glad and he said Now may the Lord be praised who has given to David a wise son to be king over this great people
Ki  Then Hiram sent to Solomon saying The words you sent have been given to me I will do all your desire in the question of cedarwood and cypresswood
Ki  My men will take them down from Lebanon to the sea where I will have them corded together to go by sea to whatever place you say and I will have them cut up there so that you may take them away as for payment it will be enough if you give me food for my people
Ki  So Hiram gave Solomon all the cedarwood and cypresswood he had need of
Ki  And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of grain as food for his people and twenty measures of clear oil this he did every year
Ki  Now the Lord had given Solomon wisdom as he had said to him and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon and they made an agreement together
Ki  Then King Solomon got together men for the forced work through all Israel thirty thousand men in number
Ki  And sent them to Lebanon in bands of ten thousand every month for a month they were working in Lebanon and for two months in their country and Adoniram was in control of them
Ki  Then he had seventy thousand for the work of transport and eighty thousand stonecutters in the mountains
Ki  In addition to the chiefs of the responsible men put by Solomon to oversee the work three thousand and three hundred in authority over the workmen
Ki  By the kings orders great stones stones of high price were cut out so that the base of the house might be made of squared stone
Ki  Solomons builders and Hirams builders did the work of cutting them and put edges on them and got the wood and the stone ready for the building of the house
Ki  In the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel came out of the land of Egypt in the fourth year that Solomon was king of Israel in the month Ziv which is the second month the building of the Lords house was started
Ki  The house which Solomon made for the Lord was sixty cubits long twenty cubits wide and thirty cubits high
Ki  The covered way before the Temple of the house was twenty cubits long as wide as the house and ten cubits wide in front of the house
Ki  And for the house he made windows with network across
Ki  And against the walls all round and against the walls of the Temple and of the inmost room he put up wings with side rooms all round
Ki  The lowest line of them being five cubits wide the middle six cubits wide and the third seven cubits for there was a space all round the outside walls of the house so that the boards supporting the rooms did not have to be fixed in the walls of the house
Ki  And the stones used in the building of the house were squared at the place where they were cut out there was no sound of hammer or axe or any iron instrument while they were building the house
Ki  The door to the lowest side rooms was in the right side of the house and they went up by twisting steps into the middle rooms and from the middle into the third
Ki  So he put up the house and made it complete roofing it with boards of cedarwood
Ki  And he put up the line of side rooms against the walls of the house fifteen cubits high resting against the house on boards of cedarwood
Ki  And the word of the Lord came to Solomon saying
Ki  About this house which you are building if you will keep my laws and give effect to my decisions and be guided by my rules I will give effect to my word which I gave to David your father
Ki  And I will be ever among the children of Israel and will not go away from my people
Ki  So Solomon made the building of the house complete
Ki  The walls of the house were covered inside with cedarwood boards from the floor to the roof of the house they were covered inside with wood and the floor was covered with boards of cypresswood
Ki  And at the back of the house a further space of twenty cubits was shut in with boards of cedarwood for the inmost room
Ki  And the house that is the Temple in front of the holy place was forty cubits long
Ki  All the inside of the house was cedarwood ornamented with designs of buds and flowers no stonework was to be seen inside
Ki  And he made ready an inmost room in the middle of the house in which to put the ark of the agreement of the Lord
Ki  And the inmost room was twenty cubits square and twenty cubits high plated over with clear gold and he made an altar of cedarwood plating it with gold
Ki  Solomon had all the inside of the house covered with gold and he put chains of gold across in front of the inmost room which itself was covered with gold
Ki  Plates of gold were put all through the house till it was covered completely and the altar in the inmost room was all covered with gold
Ki  In the inmost room he made two winged beings of olivewood ten cubits high
Ki  With outstretched wings five cubits wide the distance from the edge of one wing to the edge of the other was ten cubits
Ki  The two winged ones were ten cubits high of the same size and form
Ki  The two of them were ten cubits high
Ki  These were placed inside the inner house their outstretched wings touching the walls of the house one touching one wall and one the other while their other wings were touching in the middle
Ki  These winged ones were plated over with gold
Ki  And all the walls of the house inside and out were ornamented with forms of winged ones and palmtrees and open flowers
Ki  And the floor of the house was covered with gold inside and out
Ki  For the way into the inmost room he made doors of olivewood the arch and the door supports forming a fivesided opening
Ki  On the olivewood doors were cut designs of winged ones and palmtrees and open flowers all of them with the doors plated with gold
Ki  Then he made pillars of olivewood for the way into the Temple the pillars were square
Ki  And two folding doors of cypresswood with two leaves
Ki  These were ornamented with designs of winged ones and palmtrees and open flowers plated over with gold
Ki  And the inner space was walled with three lines of squared stones and a line of cedarwood boards
Ki  In the fourth year the base of the house was put in its place in the month Ziv
Ki  And in the eleventh year in the month Bul which is the eighth month the building of the house was complete in every detail as it had been designed So he was seven years building it
Ki  Solomon was thirteen years building a house for himself till it was complete
Ki  And he made the house of the Woods of Lebanon which was a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high resting on four lines of cedarwood pillars with cedarwood supports on the pillars
Ki  And it was covered with cedar over the fortyfive supports which were on the pillars fifteen in a line
Ki  There were three lines of windowframes window facing window in every line
Ki  And all the doors and windows had square frames with the windows facing one another in three lines
Ki  And he made a covered room of pillars fifty cubits long and thirty cubits wide and  with steps before it
Ki  Then he made a covered room for his high seat when he gave decisions this was the covered room of judging it was covered with cedarwood from floor to roof
Ki  And the house for his livingplace the other open square in the covered room was made in the same way And then he made a house like it for Pharaohs daughter whom Solomon had taken as his wife
Ki  All these buildings were made inside and out from base to crowning stone and outside to the great walled square of highly priced stone cut to different sizes with cuttinginstruments
Ki  And the base was of great masses of highly priced stone some ten cubits and some eight cubits square
Ki  Overhead were highly priced stones cut to measure and cedarwood
Ki  The great outer square all round was walled with three lines of squared stones and a line of cedarwood boards round about the open square inside the house of the Lord and the covered room of the kings house
Ki  Then King Solomon sent and got Hiram from Tyre
Ki  He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali and his father was a man of Tyre a worker in brass he was full of wisdom and knowledge and an expert worker in brass He came to King Solomon and did all his work for him
Ki  He it was who made the two brass pillars the first pillar was eighteen cubits high and a line of twelve cubits went round it and the second was the same
Ki  And he made the two crowns to be put on the tops of the pillars of brass made soft in the fire the crowns were five cubits high
Ki  There were nets of openwork for the crowns on the tops of the pillars a net of openwork for one and a net of openwork for the other
Ki  And he made ornaments of apples and two lines of apples all round over the network covering the crowns of the pillars the two crowns in the same way
Ki  The crowns on the tops of the pillars were ornamented with a design of flowers and were four cubits across
Ki  And there were crowns on the two pillars near the round part by the network and there were two hundred apples in lines round every crown
Ki  He put up the pillars at the doorway of the Temple naming the one on the right Jachin and that on the left Boaz
Ki  The tops of the pillars had a design of flowers and the work of making the pillars was complete
Ki  And he made a great metal watervessel ten cubits across from edge to edge five cubits high and thirty cubits round
Ki  And under the edge of it circling it all round for ten cubits were two lines of flower buds made together with it from liquid metal
Ki  It was supported on twelve oxen with their back parts turned to the middle of it three of them facing to the north three to the west three to the south and three to the east the vessel was resting on top of them
Ki  It was as thick as a mans open hand and was curved like the edge of a cup like the flower of a lily it would take two thousand baths
Ki  And he made ten wheeled bases of brass every one four cubits long four cubits wide and three cubits high
Ki  And the bases were made in this way their sides were square fixed in a framework
Ki  And on the square sides between the frames were lions oxen and winged ones and the same on the frame and over and under the lions and the oxen and the winged ones were steps
Ki  Every base had four wheels of brass turning on brass rods and their four angles had angleplates under them the angleplates under the base were of metal and there were ornaments at the side of every one
Ki  The mouth of it inside the angleplate was one cubit across it was round like a pillar a cubit and a half across it had designs cut on it the sides were square not round
Ki  The four wheels were under the frames and the rods on which the wheels were fixed were in the base the wheels were a cubit and a half high
Ki  The wheels were made like carriagewheels the rods on which they were fixed the parts forming their edges their rods and the middle points of them were all formed out of liquid metal
Ki  And there were four angleplates at the four angles of every base forming part of the structure of the base
Ki  And at the top of the base there was a round vessel half a cubit high
Ki  In the spaces of the flat sides and on the frames of them he made designs of winged ones lions and palmtrees with ornamented edges all round
Ki  All the ten bases were made in this way after the same design of the same size and form
Ki  And he made ten brass washingvessels everyone taking forty baths and measuring four cubits one vessel was placed on every one of the ten bases
Ki  And he put the bases by the house five on the right side and five on the left and he put the great watervessel on the right side of the house to the east facing south
Ki  And Hiram made the pots and spades and the basins So Hiram came to the end of all the work he did for King Solomon in the house of the Lord
Ki  The two pillars and the two cups of the crowns which were on the tops of the two pillars and the network covering the two cups of the crowns on the tops of the pillars
Ki  And the four hundred apples for the network two lines of apples for every network covering the two cups of the crowns on the pillars
Ki  And the ten bases with the ten washingvessels on them
Ki  And the great watervessel with the twelve oxen under it
Ki  And the pots and the spades and the basins all the vessels which Hiram made for King Solomon for the house of the Lord were of polished brass
Ki  He made them of liquid metal in the lowland of Jordan at the way across the river at Adama between Succoth and Zarethan
Ki  The weight of all these vessels was not measured because there was such a number of them it was not possible to get the weight of the brass
Ki  And Solomon had all the vessels made for use in the house of the Lord the altar of gold and the gold table on which the holy bread was placed
Ki  And the supports for the lights five on the right side and five on the left before the inmost room of clear gold and the flowers and the lights and all the instruments of gold
Ki  And the cups and the scissors and the basins and the spoons and the firetrays all of gold and the pins on which the doors were turned the doors of the inner house the most holy place and the doors of the Temple all of gold
Ki  So all the work King Solomon had done in the house of the Lord was complete Then Solomon took the holy things which David his father had given the silver and the gold and all the vessels and put them in the storehouses of the house of the Lord
Ki  Then Solomon sent for all the responsible men of Israel and all the chiefs of the tribes and the heads of families of the children of Israel to come to him in Jerusalem to take the ark of the Lords agreement up out of the town of David which is Zion
Ki  And all the men of Israel came together to King Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim the seventh month
Ki  And all the responsible men of Israel came and the priests took up the ark
Ki  They took up the ark of the Lord and the Tent of meeting and all the holy vessels which were in the Tent all these the priests and the Levites took up
Ki  And King Solomon and all the men of Israel who had come together there were with him before the ark making offerings of sheep and oxen more than might be numbered
Ki  And the priests took the ark of the agreement of the Lord and put it in its place in the inner room of the house in the most holy place under the wings of the winged ones
Ki  For their wings were outstretched over the place where the ark was covering the ark and its rods
Ki  The rods were so long that their ends were seen from the holy place in front of the inmost room but they were not seen from outside and there they are to this day
Ki  There was nothing in the ark but the two flat stones which Moses put there at Horeb where the Lord made an agreement with the children of Israel when they came out of the land of Egypt
Ki  Now when the priests had come out of the holy place the house of the Lord was full of the cloud
Ki  So that the priests were not able to keep their places to do their work because of the cloud for the house of the Lord was full of the glory of the Lord
Ki  Then Solomon said O Lord to the sun you have given the heaven for a livingplace but your livingplace was not seen by men
Ki  So I have made for you a livingplace a house in which you may be for ever present
Ki  Then turning his face about the king gave a blessing to all the men of Israel and they were all on their feet together
Ki  And he said Praise be to the Lord the God of Israel who himself gave his word to David my father and with his strong hand has made his word come true saying
Ki  From the day when I took my people Israel out of Egypt no town in all the tribes of Israel has been marked out by me for the building of a house for the restingplace of my name but I made selection of David to be king over my people Israel
Ki  Now it was in the heart of David my father to put up a house for the name of the Lord the God of Israel
Ki  But the Lord said to David my father You did well to have in your heart the desire to make a house for my name
Ki  But you yourself will not be the builder of my house but your son the offspring of your body he it is who will put up a house for my name
Ki  And the Lord has made his word come true for I have taken my father Davids place on the seat of the kingdom of Israel as the Lord gave his word and I have made a house for the name of the Lord the God of Israel
Ki  In it I have made a place for the ark in which is the agreement which the Lord made with our fathers when he took them out of the land of Egypt
Ki  Then Solomon took his place before the altar of the Lord all the men of Israel being present and stretching out his hands to heaven
Ki  Said O Lord the God of Israel there is no God like you in heaven or on the earth keeping faith and mercy unchanging for your servants while they go in your ways with all their hearts
Ki  And you have kept the word which you gave to your servant David my father with your mouth you said it and with your hand you have made it come true this day
Ki  So now O Lord the God of Israel let your word to your servant David my father come true when you said You will never be without a man to take his place on the seat of the kingdom of Israel before me if only your children give attention to their ways walking before me as you have done
Ki  So now O God of Israel it is my prayer that you will make your word come true which you said to your servant David my father
Ki  But is it truly possible that God may be housed on earth see heaven and the heaven of heavens are not wide enough to be your restingplace how much less this house which I have made
Ki  Still let your heart be turned to the prayer of your servant O Lord God and to his prayer for grace give ear to the cry and the prayer which your servant sends up to you this day
Ki  That your eyes may be open to this house night and day to this place of which you have said My name will be there hearing the prayer which your servant may make turning to this place
Ki  Give ear to the prayers of your servant and the prayers of your people Israel when they make their prayers turning to this place give ear in heaven your livingplace and hearing have mercy
Ki  If a man does wrong to his neighbour and has to take an oath and comes before your altar to take his oath in this house
Ki  Then let your ear be open in heaven and be the judge of your servants giving your decision against the wrongdoer so that punishment for his sins may come on his head and by your decision keeping from evil him who has done no wrong
Ki  When your people Israel are overcome in war because of their sin against you if they are turned to you again honouring your name making prayers to you and requesting your grace in this house
Ki  Then give ear in heaven and let the sin of your people Israel have forgiveness and take them back again into the land which you gave to their fathers
Ki  When heaven is shut up and there is no rain because of their sin against you if they make prayers with their faces turned to this place honouring your name and turning away from their sin when you send trouble on them
Ki  Then give ear in heaven so that the sin of your servants and of your people Israel may have forgiveness when you make clear to them the good way in which they are to go and send rain on your land which you have given to your people for their heritage
Ki  If there is no food in the land or if there is disease or if the fruits of the earth are damaged through heat or water locust or worm if their towns are shut in by their attackers whatever trouble whatever disease there may be
Ki  Whatever prayer or request for your grace is made by any man or by all your people Israel whatever his trouble may be whose hands are stretched out to this house
Ki  Give ear in heaven your livingplace acting in mercy and give to every man whose secret heart is open to you the reward of all his ways for you and you only have knowledge of the hearts of all the children of men
Ki  So that they may give you worship all the days of their life in the land which you gave to our fathers
Ki  And as for the man from a strange land who is not of your people Israel when he comes from a far country because of the glory of your name
Ki  For they will have news of your great name and your strong hand and your outstretched arm when he comes to make his prayer turning to this house
Ki  Give ear in heaven your livingplace and give him his desire whatever it may be so that all the peoples of the earth may have knowledge of your name worshipping you as do your people Israel and that they may see that this house which I have put up is truly named by your name
Ki  If your people go out to war against their attackers by whatever way you may send them if they make their prayer to the Lord turning their faces to this town of yours and to this house which I have made for your name
Ki  Give ear in heaven to their prayer and their cry for grace and see right done to them
Ki  If they do wrong against you for no man is without sin and you are angry with them and give them up into the power of those who are fighting against them so that they take them away as prisoners into a strange land far off or near
Ki  And if they take thought in the land where they are prisoners and are turned again to you crying out in prayer to you in that land and saying We are sinners we have done wrong we have done evil
Ki  And with all their heart and soul are turned again to you in the land of those who took them prisoners and make their prayer to you turning their eyes to this land which you gave to their fathers and to the town which you took for yourself and the house which I made for your name
Ki  Then give ear to their prayer and to their cry in heaven your livingplace and see right done to them
Ki  Answering with forgiveness the people who have done wrong against you and overlooking the evil which they have done against you let those who made them prisoners be moved with pity for them and have pity on them
Ki  For they are your people and your heritage which you took out of Egypt out of the iron fireplace
Ki  Let your eyes be open to your servants prayer for grace and to the prayer of your people Israel hearing them when their cry comes to you
Ki  For you made them separate from all the peoples of the earth to be your heritage as you said by Moses your servant when you took our fathers out of Egypt O Lord God
Ki  Then Solomon after making all these prayers and requests for grace to the Lord got up from his knees before the altar of the Lord where his hands had been stretched out in prayer to heaven
Ki  And getting on his feet he gave a blessing to all the men of Israel saying with a loud voice
Ki  Praise be to the Lord who has given rest to his people Israel as he gave them his word to do every word of all his oath which he gave by the hand of Moses his servant has come true
Ki  Now may the Lord our God be with us as he was with our fathers let him never go away from us or give us up
Ki  Turning our hearts to himself guiding us to go in all his ways to keep his orders and his laws and his decisions which he gave to our fathers
Ki  And may these my words the words of my prayer to the Lord be before the Lord our God day and night so that he may see right done to his servant and to his people Israel day by day as we have need
Ki  So that all the peoples of the earth may see that the Lord is God and there is no other
Ki  Then let your hearts be without sin before the Lord our God walking in his laws and keeping his orders as at this day
Ki  Now the king and all Israel with him were making offerings before the Lord
Ki  And Solomon gave to the Lord for peaceofferings twentytwo thousand oxen and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep So the king and all the children of Israel kept the feast of the opening of the Lords house
Ki  The same day the king made holy the middle of the open square in front of the house of the Lord offering there the burned offering and the meal offering and the fat of the peaceofferings for there was not room on the brass altar of the Lord for the burned offerings and the meal offerings and the fat of the peaceofferings
Ki  So Solomon and all Israel with him a very great meeting for the people had come together from the way into Hamath to the river of Egypt kept the feast at that time before the Lord our God for two weeks even fourteen days
Ki  And on the eighth day he sent the people away and blessing the king they went to their tents full of joy and glad in their hearts because of all the good which the Lord had done to David his servant and to Israel his people
Ki  Now when Solomon came to the end of building the house of the Lord and the kings house and all Solomons desires which he had in mind were effected
Ki  The Lord came to him again in a vision as he had done at Gibeon
Ki  And the Lord said to him Your prayers and your requests for grace have come to my ears I have made holy this house which you have made and I have put my name there for ever my eyes and my heart will be there at all times
Ki  As for you if you will go on your way before me as David your father did uprightly and with a true heart doing what I have given you orders to do keeping my laws and my decisions
Ki  Then I will make the seat of your rule over Israel certain for ever as I gave my word to David your father saying You will never be without a man to be king in Israel
Ki  But if you are turned from my ways you or your children and do not keep my orders and my laws which I have put before you but go and make yourselves servants to other gods and give them worship
Ki  Then I will have Israel cut off from the land which I have given them and this house which I have made holy for myself I will put away from before my eyes and Israel will be a public example and a word of shame among all peoples
Ki  And this house will become a mass of broken walls and everyone who goes by will be overcome with wonder at it and make whistling sounds and they will say Why has the Lord done so to this land and to this house
Ki  And their answer will be Because they were turned away from the Lord their God who took their fathers out of the land of Egypt they took for themselves other gods and gave them worship and became their servants that is why the Lord has sent all this evil on them
Ki  Now at the end of twenty years in which time Solomon had put up the two houses the house of the Lord and the kings house
Ki  Hiram king of Tyre had given Solomon cedartrees and cypresstrees and gold as much as he had need of King Solomon gave Hiram twenty towns in the land of Galilee
Ki  But when Hiram came from Tyre to see the towns which Solomon had given him he was not pleased with them
Ki  And he said What sort of towns are these which you have given me my brother So they were named the land of Cabul to this day
Ki  And Hiram sent the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold
Ki  Now this was the way of Solomons system of forced work for the building of the Lords house and of the kings house and the Millo and the wall of Jerusalem and Megiddo and Gezer 
Ki  Pharaoh king of Egypt came and took Gezer burning it down and putting to death the Canaanites living in the town and he gave it for a brideoffering to his daughter Solomons wife 
Ki   and Solomon was the builder of Gezer and Bethhoron the lower
Ki  And Baalath and Tamar in the waste land in that land
Ki  And all the storetowns and the towns which Solomon had for his warcarriages and for his horsemen and everything which it was his pleasure to put up in Jerusalem and in Lebanon and in all the land under his rule
Ki  As for the rest of the Amorites the Hittites the Perizzites the Hivites and the Jebusites who were not children of Israel
Ki  Their children who were still in the land and whom the children of Israel had not been able to put to complete destruction them did Solomon put to forced work to this day
Ki  But Solomon did not put the children of Israel to forced work they were the men of war his servants his captains and his chiefs captains of his warcarriages and of his horsemen
Ki  These were the chiefs of the overseers of Solomons work five hundred and fifty in authority over the people who did the work
Ki  At that time Solomon made Pharaohs daughter come up from the town of David to the house which he had made for her then he made the Millo
Ki  Three times in the year it was Solomons way to give burned offerings and peaceofferings on the altar he had made to the Lord causing his fireoffering to go up on the altar before the Lord
Ki  And King Solomon made a seaforce of ships in Eziongeber by Eloth on the Red Sea in the land of Edom
Ki  Hiram sent his servants who were experienced seamen in the seaforce with Solomons men
Ki  And they came to Ophir where they got four hundred and twenty talents of gold and took it back to King Solomon
Ki  Now the queen of Sheba hearing great things of Solomon came to put his wisdom to the test with hard questions
Ki  And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train with camels weighted down with spices and stores of gold and jewels and when she came to Solomon she had talk with him of everything in her mind
Ki  And Solomon gave her answers to all her questions there was no secret which the king did not make clear to her
Ki  And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon and the house which he had made
Ki  And the food at his table and all his servants seated there and those who were waiting on him in their places and their robes and his wineservants and the burned offerings which he made in the house of the Lord there was no more spirit in her
Ki  And she said to the king The account which was given to me in my country of your acts and your wisdom was true
Ki  But I had no faith in what was said about you till I came and saw for myself and now I see that it was not half the story your wisdom and your wealth are much greater than they said
Ki  Happy are your wives happy are these your servants whose place is ever before you hearing your words of wisdom
Ki  May the Lord your God be praised whose pleasure it was to put you on the seat of the kingdom of Israel because the Lords love for Israel is eternal he has made you king to be their judge in righteousness
Ki  And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold and a great store of spices and jewels never again was such a wealth of spices seen as that which the queen of Sheba gave King Solomon
Ki  And the seaforce of Hiram in addition to gold from Ophir came back with much sandalwood and jewels
Ki  And from the sandalwood the king made pillars for the house of the Lord and for the kings house and instruments of music for the makers of melody never has such sandalwood been seen to this day
Ki  And King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all her desire whatever she made request for in addition to what he gave her freely from the impulse of his heart So she went back to her country she and her servants
Ki  Now the weight of gold which came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixtysix talents
Ki  In addition to what came to him from the business of the traders and from all the kings of the Arabians and from the rulers of the country
Ki  And Solomon made two hundred bodycovers of hammered gold every one having six hundred shekels of gold in it
Ki  And he made three hundred smaller bodycovers of hammered gold with three pounds of gold in every cover and the king put them in the house of the Woods of Lebanon
Ki  Then the king made a great ivory seat plated with the best gold
Ki  There were six steps going up to it and the top of it was round at the back there were arms on the two sides of the seat and two lions by the side of the arms
Ki  And twelve lions were placed on the one side and on the other side on the six steps there was nothing like it in any kingdom
Ki  And all King Solomons drinkingvessels were of gold and all the vessels of the house of the Woods of Lebanon were of the best gold not one was of silver for no one gave a thought to silver in the days of King Solomon
Ki  For the king had Tarshishships at sea with the ships of Hiram once every three years the Tarshishships came with gold and silver and ivory and monkeys and peacocks
Ki  And King Solomon was greater than all the kings of the earth in wealth and in wisdom
Ki  And from all over the earth they came to see Solomon and to give ear to his wisdom which God had put in his heart
Ki  And everyone took with him an offering vessels of silver and vessels of gold and robes and coats of metal and spices and horses and beasts of transport regularly year by year
Ki  And Solomon got together warcarriages and horsemen he had one thousand four hundred carriages and twelve thousand horsemen whom he kept some in the carriagetowns and some with the king at Jerusalem
Ki  And the king made silver as common as stones in Jerusalem and cedars like the sycamoretrees of the lowlands in number
Ki  And Solomons horses came from Egypt and from Kue the kings traders got them at a price from Kue
Ki  A warcarriage might be got from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver and a horse for a hundred and fifty they got them at the same rate for all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram
Ki  Now a number of strange women were loved by Solomon women of the Moabites Ammonites Edomites Zidonians and Hittites
Ki  The nations of which the Lord had said to the children of Israel You are not to take wives from them and they are not to take wives from you or they will certainly make you go after their gods to these Solomon was united in love
Ki  He had seven hundred wives daughters of kings and three hundred other wives and through his wives his heart was turned away
Ki  For it came about that when Solomon was old his heart was turned away to other gods by his wives and his heart was no longer true to the Lord his God as the heart of his father David had been
Ki  For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians and Milcom the disgusting god of the Ammonites
Ki  And Solomon did evil in the eyes of the Lord not walking in the Lords ways with all his heart as David his father did
Ki  Then Solomon put up a high place for Chemosh the disgusting god of Moab in the mountain before Jerusalem and for Molech the disgusting god worshipped by the children of Ammon
Ki  And so he did for all his strange wives who made offerings with burning of perfumes to their gods
Ki  And the Lord was angry with Solomon because his heart was turned away from the Lord the God of Israel who had twice come to him in a vision
Ki  And had given him orders about this very thing that he was not to go after other gods but he did not keep the orders of the Lord
Ki  So the Lord said to Solomon Because you have done this and have not kept my agreement and my laws which I gave you I will take the kingdom away from you by force and will give it to your servant
Ki  I will not do it in your lifetime because of your father David but I will take it from your son
Ki  Still I will not take all the kingdom from him but I will give one tribe to your son because of my servant David and because of Jerusalem the town of my selection
Ki  So the Lord sent Hadad the Edomite to make trouble for Solomon he was of the kings seed in Edom
Ki  And when David had sent destruction on Edom and Joab the captain of the army had gone to put the dead into the earth and had put to death every male in Edom
Ki  For Joab and all Israel were there six months till every male in Edom had been cut off
Ki  Hadad being still a young boy went in flight to Egypt with certain Edomites servants of his father
Ki  And they went on from Midian and came to Paran and taking men from Paran with them they came to Egypt to Pharaoh king of Egypt who gave him a house and gave orders for his food and gave him land
Ki  Now Hadad was very pleasing to Pharaoh so that he gave him the sister of his wife Tahpenes the queen for his wife
Ki  And the sister of Tahpenes had a son by him Genubath whom Tahpenes took care of in Pharaohs house and Genubath was living in Pharaohs house among Pharaohs sons
Ki  Now when Hadad had news in Egypt that David had been put to rest with his fathers and that Joab the captain of the army was dead he said to Pharaoh Send me back to my country
Ki  But Pharaoh said to him What have you been short of while you have been with me that you are desiring to go back to your country And he said Nothing but even so send me back
Ki  And God sent another troublemaker Rezon the son of Eliada who had gone in flight from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah
Ki  He got some men together and made himself captain of a band of outlaws and went to Damascus and became king there
Ki  He was a trouble to Israel all through the days of Solomon And this is the damage Hadad did he was cruel to Israel while he was ruler over Edom
Ki  And there was Jeroboam the son of Nebat an Ephraimite from Zeredah a servant of Solomon whose mother was Zeruah a widow and his hand was lifted up against the king
Ki  The way in which his hand came to be lifted up against the king was this Solomon was building the Millo and making good the damaged parts of the town of his father David
Ki  And Jeroboam was an able and responsible man and Solomon saw that he was a good worker and made him overseer of all the work given to the sons of Joseph
Ki  Now at that time when Jeroboam was going out of Jerusalem the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite came across him on the road now Ahijah had put on a new robe and the two of them were by themselves in the open country
Ki  And Ahijah took his new robe in his hands parting it violently into twelve
Ki  And he said to Jeroboam Take ten of the parts for this is what the Lord has said See I will take the kingdom away from Solomon by force and will give ten tribes to you
Ki  But one tribe will be his because of my servant David and because of Jerusalem the town which out of all the tribes of Israel I have made mine
Ki  Because they are turned away from me to the worship of Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians and Chemosh the god of Moab and Milcom the god of the Ammonites they have not been walking in my ways or doing what is right in my eyes or keeping my laws and my decisions as his father David did
Ki  But I will not take the kingdom from him I will let him be king all the days of his life because of David my servant in whom I took delight because he kept my orders and my laws
Ki  But I will take the kingdom from his son and give it to you
Ki  And one tribe I will give to his son so that David my servant may have a light for ever burning before me in Jerusalem the town which I have made mine to put my name there
Ki  And you I will take and you will be king over Israel ruling over whatever is the desire of your soul
Ki  And if you give attention to the orders I give you walking in my ways and doing what is right in my eyes and keeping my laws and my orders as David my servant did then I will be with you building up for you a safe house as I did for David and I will give Israel to you
Ki  So that I may send trouble for this on the seed of David but not for ever
Ki  And Solomon was looking for a chance to put Jeroboam to death but he went in flight to Egypt to Shishak king of Egypt and was in Egypt till the death of Solomon
Ki  Now the rest of the acts of Solomon and all he did and his wisdom are they not recorded in the book of the acts of Solomon
Ki  And the time Solomon was king in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years
Ki  And Solomon went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in the town of David his father and Solomon went to rest with his fathers and Rehoboam his son became king in his place
Ki  And Rehoboam went to Shechem where all Israel had come together to make him king
Ki  And hearing of it Jeroboam the son of Nebat who was still in Egypt where he had gone in flight from Solomon and was living there came back to his town Zeredah in the hillcountry of Ephraim
Ki  And all the men of Israel came to Rehoboam and said
Ki  Your father put a hard yoke on us if you will make the conditions under which your father kept us down less cruel and the weight of the yoke he put on us less hard then we will be your servants
Ki  And he said to them Go away for three days and then come back to me again So the people went away
Ki  Then King Rehoboam took the opinion of the old men who had been with Solomon his father when he was living and said In your opinion what answer am I to give to this people
Ki  And they said to him If you will be a servant to this people today caring for them and giving them a gentle answer then they will be your servants for ever
Ki  But he gave no attention to the opinion of the old men and went to the young men of his generation who were waiting before him
Ki  And said to them What is your opinion What answer are we to give to this people who have said to me Make less the weight of the yoke which your father put on us
Ki  And the young men of his generation said to him This is the answer to give to the people who came to you saying Your father put a hard yoke on us will you make it less say to them My little finger is thicker than my fathers body
Ki  If my father put a hard yoke on you I will make it harder my father gave you punishment with whips but I will give you blows with snakes
Ki  So all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day as the king had given orders saying Come back to me the third day
Ki  And the king gave them a rough answer giving no attention to the suggestion of the old men
Ki  But giving them the answer put forward by the young men saying My father made your yoke hard but I will make it harder my father gave you punishment with whips but I will give it with snakes
Ki  So the king did not give ear to the people and this came about by the purpose of the Lord so that what he had said by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat might be effected
Ki  And when all Israel saw that the king would give no attention to them the people in answer said to the king What part have we in David what is our heritage in the son of Jesse to your tents O Israel now see to your people David So Israel went away to their tents
Ki  But Rehoboam was still king over those of the children of Israel who were living in the towns of Judah
Ki  Then King Rehoboam sent Adoniram the overseer of the forced work and he was stoned to death by all Israel And King Rehoboam went quickly and got into his carriage to go in flight to Jerusalem
Ki  So Israel was turned away from the family of David to this day
Ki  Now when all Israel had news that Jeroboam had come back they sent for him to come before the meeting of the people and made him king over Israel not one of them was joined to the family of David but only the tribe of Judah
Ki  When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem he got together all the men of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin a hundred and eighty thousand of his best fightingmen to make war against Israel and get the kingdom back for Rehoboam the son of Solomon
Ki  But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God saying
Ki  Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon king of Judah and to all the men of Judah and Benjamin and the rest of the people
Ki  The Lord has said You are not to go to war against your brothers the children of Israel go back every man to his house because this thing is my purpose So they gave ear to the word of the Lord and went back as the Lord had said
Ki  Then Jeroboam made the town of Shechem in the hillcountry of Ephraim a strong place and was living there and from there he went out and did the same to Penuel
Ki  And Jeroboam said in his heart Now the kingdom will go back to the family of David
Ki  If the people go up to make offerings in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem their heart will be turned again to their lord to Rehoboam king of Judah and they will put me to death and go back to Rehoboam king of Judah
Ki  So after taking thought the king made two oxen of gold and he said to the people You have been going up to Jerusalem long enough see these are your gods O Israel who took you out of the land of Egypt
Ki  And he put one in Bethel and the other in Dan
Ki  And this became a sin in Israel for the people went to give worship to the one at Bethel and to the other at Dan
Ki  And he made places for worship at the high places and made priests who were not Levites from among all the people
Ki  And Jeroboam gave orders for a feast in the eighth month on the fifteenth day of the month like the feast which is kept in Judah and he went up to the altar And in the same way in Bethel he gave offerings to the oxen which he had made placing in Bethel the priests of the high places he had made
Ki  He went up to the altar he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day of the eighth month the month fixed by him at his pleasure and he gave orders for a feast for the people of Israel and went up to the altar and there he made the smoke of his offerings go up
Ki  Then a man of God came from Judah by the order of the Lord to Bethel where Jeroboam was by the altar burning offerings
Ki  And by the order of the Lord he made an outcry against the altar saying O altar altar the Lord has said From the seed of David will come a child named Josiah and on you he will put to death the priests of the high places who are burning offerings on you and mens bones will be burned on you
Ki  The same day he gave them a sign saying This is the sign which the Lord has given See the altar will be broken and the burned waste on it overturned
Ki  Then the king hearing the man of God crying out against the altar at Bethel put out his hand from the altar saying Take him prisoner And his hand stretched out against him became dead and he had no power of pulling it back
Ki  And the altar was broken and the burned waste on it overturned this was the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the Lord
Ki  Then the king made answer and said to the man of God Make a prayer now for the grace of the Lord your God and for me that my hand may be made well And in answer to the prayer of the man of God the kings hand was made well again as it was before
Ki  And the king said to the man of God Come with me to my house for food and rest and I will give you a reward
Ki  But the man of God said to the king Even if you gave me half of all you have I would not go in with you and I would not take food or a drink of water in this place
Ki  For so I was ordered by the word of the Lord who said You are not to take food or a drink of water and you are not to go back the way you came
Ki  So he went another way and not by the way he came to Bethel
Ki  Now there was an old prophet living in Bethel and one of his sons came and gave him word of all the man of God had done that day in Bethel and they gave their father an account of the words he had said to the king
Ki  Then their father said to them Which way did he go Now his sons had seen which way the man of God who came from Judah had gone
Ki  So the prophet said to his sons Make ready an ass for me So they made an ass ready and he got on it
Ki  And went after the man of God and came up with him while he was seated under an oaktree And he said to him Are you the man of God who came from Judah And he said I am
Ki  Then he said to him Come back to the house with me and have a meal
Ki  But he said I may not go back with you or go into your house and I will not take food or a drink of water with you in this place
Ki  For the Lord said to me You are not to take food or water there or go back again by the way you came
Ki  Then he said to him I am a prophet like you and an angel said to me by the word of the Lord Take him back with you and give him food and water But he said false words to him
Ki  So he went back with him and had a meal in his house and a drink of water
Ki  But while they were seated at the table the word of the Lord came to the prophet who had taken him back
Ki  And crying out to the man of God who came from Judah he said The Lord says Because you have gone against the voice of the Lord and have not done as you were ordered by the Lord
Ki  But have come back and have taken food and water in this place where he said you were to take no food or water your dead body will not be put to rest with your fathers
Ki  Now after the meal he made ready the ass for him for the prophet whom he had taken back
Ki  And he went on his way but on the road a lion came rushing at him and put him to death and his dead body was stretched in the road with the ass by its side and the lion was there by the body
Ki  And some men going by saw the body stretched out in the road with the lion by its side and they came and gave news of it in the town where the old prophet was living
Ki  Then the prophet who had made him come back hearing it said It is the man of God who went against the word of the Lord that is why the Lord has given him to the lion to be wounded to death as the Lord said
Ki  And he said to his sons Make ready the ass for me And they did so
Ki  And he went and saw the dead body stretched out in the road with the ass and the lion by its side the lion had not taken the body for its food or done any damage to the ass
Ki  Then the prophet took up the body of the man of God and put it on the ass and took it back and he came to the town to put the body to rest with weeping
Ki  And he put the body in the restingplace made ready for himself weeping and sorrowing over it saying O my brother
Ki  And when he had put it to rest he said to his sons When I am dead then you are to put my body into the earth with the body of this man of God and put me by his bones so that my bones may be kept safe with his bones
Ki  For the outcry he made by the word of the Lord against the altar in Bethel and against all the houses of the high places in the towns of Samaria will certainly come about
Ki  After this Jeroboam not turning back from his evil ways still made priests for his altars from among all the people he made a priest of anyone desiring it so that there might be priests of the high places
Ki  And this became a sin in the family of Jeroboam causing it to be cut off and sent to destruction from the face of the earth
Ki  At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam became ill
Ki  And Jeroboam said to his wife Now come put on different clothing so that you may not seem to be the wife of Jeroboam and go to Shiloh see Ahijah is there the prophet who said I would be king over this people
Ki  And take with you ten cakes of bread and dry cakes and a pot of honey and go to him he will give you word of what is to become of the child
Ki  So Jeroboams wife did so and got up and went to Shiloh and came to the house of Ahijah Now Ahijah was unable to see because he was very old
Ki  And the Lord had said to Ahijah The wife of Jeroboam is coming to get news from you about her son who is ill give her such and such an answer for she will make herself seem to be another woman
Ki  Then Ahijah hearing the sound of her footsteps coming in at the door said Come in O wife of Jeroboam why do you make yourself seem like another for I am sent to you with bitter news
Ki  Go say to Jeroboam These are the words of the Lord the God of Israel Though I took you from among the people lifting you up to be a ruler over my people Israel
Ki  And took the kingdom away by force from the seed of David and gave it to you you have not been like my servant David who kept my orders and was true to me with all his heart doing only what was right in my eyes
Ki  But you have done evil more than any before you and have made for yourself other gods and images of metal moving me to wrath and turning your back on me
Ki  So I will send evil on the line of Jeroboam cutting off from his family every male child those who are shut up and those who go free in Israel the family of Jeroboam will be brushed away like a man brushing away waste till it is all gone
Ki  Those of the family of Jeroboam who come to death in the town will become food for the dogs and those on whom death comes in the open country will be food for the birds of the air for the Lord has said it
Ki  Up then go back to your house and in the hour when your feet go into the town the death of the child will take place
Ki  And all Israel will put his body to rest weeping over him because he only of the family of Jeroboam will be put into his restingplace in the earth for of all the family of Jeroboam in him only has the Lord the God of Israel seen some good
Ki  And the Lord will put up a king over Israel who will send destruction on the family of Jeroboam in that day
Ki  And even now the hand of the Lord has come down on Israel shaking it like a rivergrass in the water and uprooting Israel from this good land which he gave to their fathers he will send them this way and that on the other side of the River because they have made for themselves images moving the Lord to wrath
Ki  And he will give Israel up because of the sins which Jeroboam has done and made Israel do
Ki  Then Jeroboams wife got up and went away and came to Tirzah and when she came to the doorway of the house death came to the child
Ki  And all Israel put his body to rest weeping over him as the Lord had said by his servant Ahijah the prophet
Ki  Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam how he made war and how he became king are recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel
Ki  And Jeroboam was king for twentytwo years and was put to rest with his fathers and Nadab his son became king in his place
Ki  And Rehoboam the son of Solomon was king in Judah Rehoboam was fortyone years old when he became king and he was king for seventeen years in Jerusalem the town which the Lord had made his out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there his mothers name was Naamah an Ammonite woman
Ki  And Judah did evil in the eyes of the Lord and made him more angry than their fathers had done by their sins
Ki  For they made high places and upright stones and wood pillars on every high hill and under every green tree
Ki  And more than this there were those in the land who were used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods doing the same disgusting crimes as the nations which the Lord had sent out before the children of Israel
Ki  Now in the fifth year of King Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem
Ki  And took away all the stored wealth from the house of the Lord and from the kings house and all the gold bodycovers which Solomon had made
Ki  So in their place King Rehoboam had other bodycovers made of brass and gave them into the care of the captains of the armed men who were stationed at the door of the kings house
Ki  And whenever the king went into the house of the Lord the armed men went with him taking the bodycovers and then took them back to their room
Ki  Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam and all he did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah
Ki  And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days
Ki  And Rehoboam went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth with his fathers in the town of David his mothers name was Naamah an Ammonite woman And Abijam his son became king in his place
Ki  Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat Abijam became king over Judah
Ki  For three years he was king in Jerusalem and his mothers name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom
Ki  And he did the same sins which his father had done before him his heart was not completely true to the Lord his God like the heart of David his father
Ki  But because of David the Lord gave him a light in Jerusalem making his sons king after him so that Jerusalem might be safe
Ki  Because David did what was right in the eyes of the Lord and never in all his life went against his orders but only in the question of Uriah the Hittite
Ki  
Ki  Now the rest of the acts of Abijam and all he did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam
Ki  Then Abijam went to rest with his fathers and they put him into the earth in the town of David and Asa his son became king in his place
Ki  In the twentieth year that Jeroboam was king of Israel Asa became king over Judah
Ki  And he was king for fortyone years in Jerusalem his mothers name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom
Ki  Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord as David his father did
Ki  Those used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods he sent out of the country and he took away all the images which his fathers had made
Ki  And he would not let Maacah his mother be queen because she had made a disgusting image for Asherah and Asa had the image cut down and burned by the stream Kidron
Ki  The high places however were not taken away but still the heart of Asa was true to the Lord all his life
Ki  He took into the house of the Lord all the things which his father had made holy and those which he himself had made holy silver and gold and vessels
Ki  Now there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days
Ki  And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah building Ramah so that no one was able to go out or in to Asa king of Judah
Ki  Then Asa took all the silver and gold which was still stored in the Lords house and in the kings house and sent them in the care of his servants to Benhadad son of Tabrimmon son of Rezon king of Aram at Damascus saying
Ki  Let there be an agreement between me and you as there was between my father and your father see I have sent you an offering of silver and gold go and put an end to your agreement with Baasha king of Israel so that he may give up attacking me
Ki  So Benhadad did as King Asa said and sent the captains of his armies against the towns of Israel attacking Ijon and Dan and Abelbethmaacah and all Chinneroth as far as all the land of Naphtali
Ki  And Baasha hearing of it put a stop to the building of Ramah and was living in Tirzah
Ki  Then King Asa got all Judah together making every man come and they took away the stones and the wood with which Baasha was building Ramah and King Asa made use of them for building Geba in the land of Benjamin and Mizpah
Ki  Now the rest of the acts of Asa and his power and all he did and the towns of which he was the builder are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah But when he was old he had a disease of the feet
Ki  So Asa went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in the town of David his father and Jehoshaphat his son became king in his place
Ki  Nadab the son of Jeroboam became king over Israel in the second year that Asa was king of Judah and he was king of Israel for two years
Ki  He did evil in the eyes of the Lord copying the evil ways of his father and the sin which he did and made Israel do
Ki  And Baasha the son of Ahijah of the family of Issachar made a secret design against him attacking him at Gibbethon a town of the Philistines for Nadab and the armies of Israel were making war on Gibbethon
Ki  In the third year of the rule of Asa king of Judah Baasha put him to death and became king in his place
Ki  And straight away when he became king he sent destruction on all the offspring of Jeroboam there was not one living person of all the family of Jeroboam whom he did not put to death so the word of the Lord which he said by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite came about
Ki  Because of the sins which Jeroboam did and made Israel do moving the Lord the God of Israel to wrath
Ki  Now the rest of the acts of Nadab and all he did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel
Ki  And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days
Ki  In the third year of the rule of Asa king of Judah Baasha the son of Ahijah became king over all Israel in Tirzah and was king for twentyfour years
Ki  He did evil in the eyes of the Lord copying the evil ways of Jeroboam and the sin which he made Israel do
Ki  And the word of the Lord came to Jehu son of Hanani protesting against Baasha and saying
Ki  Because I took you up out of the dust and made you ruler over my people Israel and you have gone in the ways of Jeroboam and made my people Israel do evil moving me to wrath by their sins
Ki  Truly I will see that Baasha and all his family are completely brushed away I will make your family like the family of Jeroboam the son of Nebat
Ki  Anyone of the family of Baasha who comes to death in the town will become food for the dogs and he to whom death comes in the open country will be food for the birds of the air
Ki  Now the rest of the acts of Baasha and what he did and his power are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel
Ki  And Baasha went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth at Tirzah and Elah his son became king in his place
Ki  And the Lord sent his word against Baasha and his family by the mouth of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani because of all the evil he did in the eyes of the Lord moving him to wrath by the work of his hands because he was like the family of Jeroboam and because he put it to death
Ki  In the twentysixth year that Asa was king of Judah Elah the son of Baasha became king of Israel in Tirzah and he was king for two years
Ki  And his servant Zimri captain of half his warcarriages made secret designs against him now he was in Tirzah drinking hard in the house of Arza controller of the kings house in Tirzah
Ki  And Zimri went in and made an attack on him and put him to death in the twentyseventh year that Asa was king of Judah and made himself king in his place
Ki  And straight away when he became king and took his place on the seat of the kingdom he put to death all the family of Baasha not one male child of his relations or his friends kept his life
Ki  So Zimri put to death all the family of Baasha so that the word which the Lord said against him by the mouth of Jehu the prophet came about
Ki  Because of all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son which they did and made Israel do moving the Lord the God of Israel to wrath by their foolish acts
Ki  Now the rest of the acts of Elah and all he did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel
Ki  In the twentyseventh year of Asa king of Judah Zimri was king for seven days in Tirzah Now the people were attacking Gibbethon in the land of the Philistines
Ki  And news came to the people in the tents that Zimri had made a secret design and had put the king to death so all Israel made Omri the captain of the army king that day in the tents
Ki  Then Omri went up from Gibbethon with all the army of Israel and they made an attack on Tirzah shutting in the town on every side
Ki  And when Zimri saw that the town was taken he went into the inner room of the kings house and burning the house over his head came to his end
Ki  Because of his sin in doing evil in the eyes of the Lord in going in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin which he made Israel do
Ki  Now the rest of the acts of Zimri and the secret design he made are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel
Ki  Then there was a division among the people of Israel half the people were for making Tibni son of Ginath king and half were supporting Omri
Ki  But the supporters of Omri overcame those who were on the side of Tibni the son of Ginath and death came to Tibni and to his brother Joram at that time and Omri became king in the place of Tibni
Ki  In the thirtyfirst year of Asa king of Judah Omri became king over Israel and he was king for twelve years for six years he was ruling in Tirzah
Ki  He got the hill Samaria from Shemer for the price of two talents of silver and he made a town there building it on the hill and naming it Samaria after Shemer the owner of the hill
Ki  And Omri did evil in the eyes of the Lord even worse than all those before him
Ki  Copying all the evil ways of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and all the sins he did and made Israel do moving the Lord the God of Israel to wrath by their foolish ways
Ki  Now the rest of the acts which Omri did and his great power are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel
Ki  So Omri went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in Samaria and Ahab his son became king in his place
Ki  In the thirtyeighth year that Asa was king of Judah Ahab the son of Omri became king over Israel and Ahab was king in Samaria for twentytwo years
Ki  And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the eyes of the Lord even worse than all who went before him
Ki  And as if copying the evil ways of Jeroboam the son of Nebat was a small thing for him he took as his wife Jezebel daughter of Ethbaal king of Zidon and became a servant and worshipper of Baal
Ki  And he put up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal which he had made in Samaria
Ki  And Ahab made an image of Asherah and did more than all the kings of Israel before him to make the Lord the God of Israel angry
Ki  In his days Hiel made Jericho he put its base in position at the price of Abiram his oldest son and he put its doors in place at the price of his youngest son Segub even as the Lord had said by Joshua the son of Nun
Ki  And Elijah the Tishbite of Tishbe in Gilead said to Ahab By the living Lord the God of Israel whose servant I am there will be no dew or rain in these years but only at my word
Ki  Then the word of the Lord came to him saying
Ki  Go from here in the direction of the east and keep yourself in a secret place by the stream Cherith east of Jordan
Ki  The water of the stream will be your drink and by my orders the ravens will give you food there
Ki  So he went and did as the Lord said living by the stream Cherith east of Jordan
Ki  And the ravens took him bread in the morning and meat in the evening and the water of the stream was his drink
Ki  Now after a time the stream became dry because there was no rain in the land
Ki  Then the word of the Lord came to him saying
Ki  Up go now to Zarephath in Zidon and make your livingplace there I have given orders to a widow woman there to see that you have food
Ki  So he got up and went to Zarephath and when he came to the door of the town he saw a widow woman getting sticks together and crying out to her he said Will you give me a little water in a vessel for my drink
Ki  And when she was going to get it he said to her And get me with it a small bit of bread
Ki  Then she said By the life of the Lord your God I have nothing but a little meal in my store and a drop of oil in the bottle and now I am getting two sticks together so that I may go in and make it ready for me and my son so that we may have a meal before our death
Ki  And Elijah said to her Have no fear go and do as you have said but first make me a little cake of it and come and give it to me and then make something for yourself and your son
Ki  For this is the word of the Lord the God of Israel The store of meal will not come to an end and the bottle will never be without oil till the day when the Lord sends rain on the earth
Ki  So she went and did as Elijah said and she and he and her family had food for a long time
Ki  The store of meal did not come to an end and the bottle was never without oil as the Lord had said by the mouth of Elijah
Ki  Now after this the son of the woman of the house became ill so ill that there was no breath in him
Ki  And she said to Elijah What have I to do with you O man of God have you come to put God in mind of my sin and to put my son to death
Ki  And he said to her Give your son to me And lifting him out of her arms he took him up to his room and put him down on his bed
Ki  And crying to the Lord he said O Lord my God have you sent evil even on the widow whose guest I am by causing her sons death
Ki  And stretching herself out on the child three times he made his prayer to the Lord saying O Lord my God be pleased to let this childs life come back to him again
Ki  And the Lord gave ear to the voice of Elijah and the childs spirit came into him again and he came back to life
Ki  And Elijah took the child down from his room into the house and gave him to his mother and said to her See your son is living
Ki  Then the woman said to Elijah Now I am certain that you are a man of God and that the word of the Lord in your mouth is true
Ki  Now after a long time the word of the Lord came to Elijah in the third year saying Go and let Ahab see you so that I may send rain on the earth
Ki  So Elijah went to let Ahab see him Now there was no food to be had in Samaria
Ki  And Ahab sent for Obadiah the controller of the kings house Now Obadiah had the fear of the Lord before him greatly
Ki  For when Jezebel was cutting off the prophets of the Lord Obadiah took a hundred of them and kept them secretly in a hole in the rock fifty at a time and gave them bread and water
Ki  And Ahab said to Obadiah Come let us go through all the country to all the fountains of water and all the rivers and see if there is any grass to be had for the horses and the transport beasts so that we may be able to keep some of the beasts from destruction
Ki  So they went through all the country covering it between them Ahab went in one direction by himself and Obadiah went in another by himself
Ki  And while Obadiah was on his way he came face to face with Elijah and seeing who it was he went down on his face and said Is it you my lord Elijah
Ki  And Elijah in answer said It is I now go and say to your lord Elijah is here
Ki  And he said What sin have I done that you would give up your servant into the hand of Ahab and be the cause of my death
Ki  By the life of the Lord your God there is not a nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent in search of you and when they said He is not here he made them take an oath that they had not seen you
Ki  And now you say Go say to your lord Elijah is here
Ki  And straight away when I have gone from you the spirit of the Lord will take you away I have no idea where so that when I come and give word to Ahab and he sees you not he will put me to death though I your servant have been a worshipper of the Lord from my earliest years
Ki  Has my lord not had word of what I did when Jezebel was putting the Lords prophets to death how I kept a hundred of them in a secret hole in the rock fifty at a time and gave them bread and water
Ki  And now you say Go and say to your Lord Elijah is here and he will put me to death
Ki  And Elijah said By the life of the Lord of armies whose servant I am I will certainly let him see me today
Ki  So Obadiah went to Ahab and gave him the news and Ahab went to see Elijah
Ki  And when he saw Elijah Ahab said to him Is it you you troubler of Israel
Ki  Then he said in answer I have not been troubling Israel but you and your family because turning away from the orders of the Lord you have gone after the Baals
Ki  Now send and get Israel together before me at Mount Carmel with the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal who get their food at Jezebels table
Ki  So Ahab sent for all the children of Israel and got the prophets together at Mount Carmel
Ki  And Elijah came near to all the people and said How long will you go on balancing between two opinions if the Lord is God then give worship to him but if Baal give worship to him And the people said not a word in answer
Ki  Then Elijah said to the people I even I am the only living prophet of the Lord but Baals prophets are four hundred and fifty men
Ki  Now let them give us two oxen and let them take one for themselves and have it cut up and put it on the wood but put no fire under it I will get the other ox ready and put it on the wood and put no fire under it
Ki  And do you make prayers to your god and I will make a prayer to the Lord and it will be clear that the one who gives an answer by fire is God And all the people in answer said It is well said
Ki  Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal Take one ox for yourselves and get it ready first for there are more of you and make your prayers to your god but put no fire under
Ki  So they took the ox which was given them and made it ready crying out to Baal from morning till the middle of the day and saying O Baal give ear to us But there was no voice and no answer And they were jumping up and down before the altar they had made
Ki  And in the middle of the day Elijah made sport of them saying Give louder cries for he is a god he may be deep in thought or he may have gone away for some purpose or he may be on a journey or by chance he is sleeping and has to be made awake
Ki  So they gave loud cries cutting themselves with knives and swords as was their way till the blood came streaming out all over them
Ki  And from the middle of the day they went on with their prayers till the time of the offering but there was no voice or any answer or any who gave attention to them
Ki  Then Elijah said to all the people Come near to me and all the people came near And he put up again the altar of the Lord which had been broken down
Ki  And Elijah took twelve stones the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob to whom the Lord had said Israel will be your name
Ki  And with the stones he made an altar to the name of the Lord and he made a deep drain all round the altar great enough to take two measures of seed
Ki  And he put the wood in order and cutting up the ox put it on the wood Then he said Get four vessels full of water and put it on the burned offering and on the wood And he said Do it a second time and they did it a second time
Ki  And he said Do it a third time and they did it a third time
Ki  And the water went all round the altar till the drain was full
Ki  Then at the time of the offering Elijah the prophet came near and said O Lord the God of Abraham of Isaac and of Israel let it be seen this day that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and that I have done all these things by your order
Ki  Give me an answer O Lord give me an answer so that this people may see that you are God and that you have made their hearts come back again
Ki  Then the fire of the Lord came down burning up the offering and the wood and the stones and the dust and drinking up the water in the drain
Ki  And when the people saw it they all went down on their faces and said The Lord he is God the Lord he is God
Ki  And Elijah said to them Take the prophets of Baal let not one of them get away So they took them and Elijah made them go down to the stream Kishon and put them to death there
Ki  Then Elijah said to Ahab Up take food and drink for there is a sound of much rain
Ki  So Ahab went up to have food and drink while Elijah went up to the top of Carmel and he went down on the earth putting his face between his knees
Ki  And he said to his servant Go now and take a look in the direction of the sea And he went up and after looking said There is nothing And he said Go again seven times and he went seven times
Ki  And the seventh time he said I see a cloud coming up out of the sea as small as a mans hand Then he said Go up and say to Ahab Get your carriage ready and go down or the rain will keep you back
Ki  And after a very little time the heaven became black with clouds and wind and there was a great rain And Ahab went in his carriage to Jezreel
Ki  And the hand of the Lord was on Elijah and he made himself strong and went running before Ahab till they came to Jezreel
Ki  Ahab gave Jezebel news of all Elijah had done and how he had put all the prophets to death with the sword
Ki  Then Jezebel sent a servant to Elijah saying May the gods punishment be on me if I do not make your life like the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time
Ki  And he got up fearing for his life and went in flight and came to Beersheba in Judah parting there from his servant
Ki  While he himself went a days journey into the waste land and took a seat under a broomplant desiring for himself only death for he said It is enough now O Lord take away my life for I am no better than my fathers
Ki  And stretching himself on the earth he went to sleep under the broomplant but an angel touching him said to him Get up and have some food
Ki  And looking up he saw by his head a cake cooked on the stones and a bottle of water So he took food and drink and went to sleep again
Ki  And the angel of the Lord came again a second time and touching him said Get up and have some food or the journey will be overmuch for your strength
Ki  So he got up and took food and drink and in the strength of that food he went on for forty days and nights to Horeb the mountain of God
Ki  And there he went into a hole in the rock for the night then the word of the Lord came to him saying What are you doing here Elijah
Ki  And he said I have been burning for the honour of the Lord the God of armies for the children of Israel have not kept your agreement they have made destruction of your altars and have put your prophets to death with the sword till I even I am the only one living and now they are attempting to take away my life
Ki  Then he said Go out and take your place on the mountain before the Lord Then the Lord went by and mountains were parted by the force of a great wind and rocks were broken before the Lord but the Lord was not in the wind And after the wind there was an earthshock but the Lord was not in the earthshock
Ki  And after the earthshock a fire but the Lord was not in the fire And after the fire the sound of a soft breath
Ki  And Elijah hearing it went out covering his face with his robe and took his place in the opening of the hole And there a voice came to him saying What are you doing here Elijah
Ki  And he said I have been burning for the honour of the Lord the God of armies for the children of Israel have not kept your agreement they have had your altars broken down and have put your prophets to death with the sword till I even I am the only one living and now they are attempting to take away my life
Ki  And the Lord said to him Go back on your way through the waste land to Damascus and when you come there put the holy oil on Hazael to make him king over Aram
Ki  And on Jehu son of Nimshi making him king over Israel and on Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah to be prophet in your place
Ki  And it will come about that the man who gets away safe from the sword of Hazael Jehu will put to death and whoever gets away safe from the sword of Jehu Elisha will put to death
Ki  But I will keep safe seven thousand in Israel all those whose knees have not been bent to Baal and whose mouths have given him no kisses
Ki  So he went away from there and came across Elisha the son of Shaphat ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen he himself walking with the twelfth and Elijah went up to him and put his robe on him
Ki  And letting the oxen be where they were he came running after Elijah and said Only let me give a kiss to my father and mother and then I will come after you But he said to him Go back again for what have I done to you
Ki  And he went back and took the oxen and put them to death and cooking their flesh with the yokes of the oxen he gave the people a feast Then he got up and went after Elijah and became his servant
Ki  Now Benhadad king of Aram got all his army together and thirtytwo kings with him and horses and carriages of war he went up and made war on Samaria shutting it in
Ki  And he sent representatives into the town to Ahab king of Israel
Ki  And they said to him Benhadad says Your silver and your gold are mine and your wives and children are mine
Ki  And the king of Israel sent him an answer saying As you say my lord king I am yours with all I have
Ki  Then the representatives came back again and said These are the words of Benhadad I sent to you saying Give up to me your silver and your gold your wives and your children
Ki  But I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time to make a search through your house and the houses of your people and everything which is pleasing in your eyes they will take away in their hands
Ki  Then the king of Israel sent for all the responsible men of the land and said Now will you take note and see the evil purpose of this man he sent for my wives and my children my silver and my gold and I did not keep them back
Ki  And all the responsible men and the people said to him Do not give attention to him or do what he says
Ki  So he said to the representatives of Benhadad Say to my lord the king All the orders you sent the first time I will do but this thing I may not do And the representatives went back with this answer
Ki  Then Benhadad sent to him saying May the gods punishment be on me if there is enough of the dust of Samaria for all the people at my feet to take some in their hands
Ki  And the king of Israel said in answer Say to him The time for loud talk is not when a man is putting on his arms but when he is taking them off
Ki  Now when this answer was given to Benhadad he was drinking with the kings in the tents and he said to his men Take up your positions So they put themselves in position for attacking the town
Ki  Then a prophet came up to Ahab king of Israel and said The Lord says Have you seen all this great army See I will give it into your hands today and you will see that I am the Lord
Ki  And Ahab said By whom And he said The Lord says By the servants of the chiefs who are over the divisions of the land Then he said By whom is the fighting to be started And he made answer By you
Ki  Then he got together the servants of all the chiefs who were over the divisions of the land two hundred and thirtytwo of them and after them he got together all the people all the children of Israel seven thousand
Ki  And in the middle of the day they went out But Benhadad was drinking in the tents with the thirtytwo kings who were helping him
Ki  And the servants of the chiefs who were over the divisions of the land went forward first and when Benhadad sent out they gave him the news saying Men have come out from Samaria
Ki  And he said If they have come out for peace take them living and if they have come out for war take them living
Ki  So the servants of the chiefs of the divisions of the land went out of the town with the army coming after them
Ki  And every one of them put his man to death and the Aramaeans went in flight with Israel after them and Benhadad king of Aram got away safely on a horse with his horsemen
Ki  And the king of Israel went out and took the horses and the warcarriages and made great destruction among the Aramaeans
Ki  Then the prophet came up to the king of Israel and said to him Now make yourself strong and take care what you do or a year from now the king of Aram will come up against you again
Ki  Then the king of Arams servants said to him Their god is a god of the hills that is why they were stronger than we but if we make an attack on them in the lowlands we will certainly be stronger than they
Ki  This is what you have to do take away the kings from their positions and put captains in their places
Ki  And get together another army like the one which came to destruction horse for horse and carriage for carriage and let us make war on them in the lowlands and certainly we will be stronger than they And he gave ear to what they said and did so
Ki  So a year later Benhadad got the Aramaeans together and went up to Aphek to make war on Israel
Ki  And the children of Israel got themselves together and food was made ready and they went against them the tents of the children of Israel were like two little flocks of goats before them but all the country was full of the Aramaeans
Ki  And a man of God came up and said to the king of Israel The Lord says Because the Aramaeans have said The Lord is a god of the hills and not of the valleys I will give all this great army into your hands and you will see that I am the Lord
Ki  Now the two armies kept their positions facing one another for seven days And on the seventh day the fight was started and the children of Israel put to the sword a hundred thousand Aramaean footmen in one day
Ki  But the rest went in flight to Aphek into the town where a wall came down on the twentyseven thousand who were still living And Benhadad went in flight into the town into an inner room
Ki  Then his servants said to him It is said that the kings of Israel are full of mercy let us then put on haircloth and cords on our heads and go to the king of Israel it may be that he will give you your life
Ki  So they put on haircloth and cords on their heads and came to the king of Israel and said Your servant Benhadad says Let me now keep my life And he said Is he still living he is my brother
Ki  Now the men took it as a sign and quickly took up his words and they said Benhadad is your brother Then he said Go and get him So Benhadad came out to him and he made him get up into his carriage
Ki  And Benhadad said to him The towns my father took from your father I will give back and you may make streets for yourself in Damascus as my father did in Samaria And as for me at the price of this agreement you will let me go So he made an agreement with him and let him go
Ki  And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbour by the word of the Lord Give me a wound But the man would not
Ki  Then he said to him Because you have not given ear to the voice of the Lord straight away when you have gone from me a lion will put you to death And when he had gone straight away a lion came rushing at him and put him to death
Ki  Then he came across another man and said Give me a wound And the man gave him a blow wounding him
Ki  So the prophet went away and pulling his headband over his eyes to keep his face covered took his place by the road waiting for the king
Ki  And when the king went by crying out to him he said Your servant went out into the fight and a man came out to me with another man and said Keep this man if by any chance he gets away your life will be the price of his life or you will have to give a talent of silver in payment
Ki  But while your servant was turning this way and that he was gone Then the king of Israel said to him You are responsible you have given the decision against yourself
Ki  Then he quickly took the headband from his eyes and the king of Israel saw that he was one of the prophets
Ki  And he said to him These are the words of the Lord Because you have let go from your hands the man whom I had put to the curse your life will be taken for his life and your people for his people
Ki  Then the king of Israel went back to his house bitter and angry and came to Samaria
Ki  Now Naboth the Jezreelite had a vinegarden in Jezreel near the house of Ahab king of Samaria
Ki  And Ahab said to Naboth Give me your vinegarden so that I may have it for a garden of sweet plants for it is near my house and let me give you a better vinegarden in exchange or if it seems good to you let me give you its value in money
Ki  But Naboth said to Ahab By the Lord far be it from me to give you the heritage of my fathers
Ki  So Ahab came into his house bitter and angry because Naboth the Jezreelite had said to him I will not give you the heritage of my fathers And stretching himself on the bed with his face turned away he would take no food
Ki  But Jezebel his wife came to him and said Why is your spirit so bitter that you have no desire for food
Ki  And he said to her Because I was talking to Naboth the Jezreelite and I said to him Let me have your vinegarden for a price or if it is pleasing to you I will give you another vinegarden for it and he said I will not give you my vinegarden
Ki  Then Jezebel his wife said Are you now the ruler of Israel Get up take food and let your heart be glad I will give you the vinegarden of Naboth the Jezreelite
Ki  So she sent a letter in Ahabs name stamped with his stamp to the responsible men and the chiefs who were in authority with Naboth
Ki  And in the letter she said Let a time of public sorrow be fixed and put Naboth at the head of the people
Ki  And get two goodfornothing persons to come before him and give witness that he has been cursing God and the king Then take him out and have him stoned to death
Ki  So the responsible men and the chiefs who were in authority in his town did as Jezebel had said in the letter she sent them
Ki  They gave orders for a day of public sorrow and put Naboth at the head of the people
Ki  And the two goodfornothing persons came in and took their seats before him and gave witness against Naboth in front of the people saying Naboth has been cursing God and the king Then they took him outside the town and had him stoned to death
Ki  And they sent word to Jezebel saying Naboth has been stoned and is dead
Ki  Then Jezebel hearing that Naboth had been stoned and was dead said to Ahab Get up and take as your heritage the vinegarden of Naboth the Jezreelite which he would not give you for money for Naboth is no longer living but is dead
Ki  So Ahab hearing that Naboth was dead went down to the vinegarden of Naboth the Jezreelite to take it as his heritage
Ki  And the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite saying
Ki  Go down to Ahab king of Israel in Samaria see he is in the vinegarden of Naboth the Jezreelite where he has gone to take it as his heritage
Ki  Say to him The Lord says Have you put a man to death and taken his heritage Then say to him The Lord says In the place where dogs have been drinking the blood of Naboth there will your blood become the drink of dogs
Ki  And Ahab said to Elijah Have you come face to face with me O my hater And he said I have come to you because you have given yourself up to do evil in the eyes of the Lord
Ki  See I will send evil on you and put an end to you completely cutting off from Ahab every male child him who is shut up and him who goes free in Israel
Ki  And I will make your family like the family of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and like the family of Baasha the son of Ahijah because you have made me angry and have made Israel do evil
Ki  And of Jezebel the Lord said Jezebel will become food for dogs in the heritage of Jezreel
Ki  Any man of the family of Ahab who comes to his death in the town will become food for the dogs and he who comes to his death in the open country will be food for the birds of the air
Ki  There was no one like Ahab who gave himself up to do evil in the eyes of the Lord moved to it by Jezebel his wife
Ki  He did a very disgusting thing in going after false gods doing all the things the Amorites did whom the Lord sent out before the children of Israel
Ki  Hearing these words Ahab in great grief put haircloth on his flesh and went without food sleeping in haircloth and going about quietly
Ki  Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite saying
Ki  Do you see how Ahab has made himself low before me because he has made himself low before me I will not send the evil in his lifetime but in his sons time I will send the evil on his family
Ki  Now for three years there was no war between Aram and Israel
Ki  And it came about in the third year that Jehoshaphat king of Judah came down to the king of Israel
Ki  And the king of Israel said to his servants Do you not see that Ramothgilead is ours and we are doing nothing to get it back from the hands of the king of Aram
Ki  And he said to Jehoshaphat Will you go with me to Ramothgilead to make war And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel I am as you are my people as your people my horses as your horses
Ki  Then Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel Let us now get directions from the Lord
Ki  So the king of Israel got all the prophets together about four hundred men and said to them Am I to go to Ramothgilead to make war or not And they said Go up for the Lord will give it into the hands of the king
Ki  But Jehoshaphat said Is there no other prophet of the Lord here from whom we may get directions
Ki  And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat There is still one man by whom we may get directions from the Lord Micaiah son of Imlah but I have no love for him for he is a prophet of evil to me and not of good And Jehoshaphat said Let not the king say so
Ki  Then the king of Israel sent for one of his unsexed servants and said Go quickly and come back with Micaiah the son of Imlah
Ki  Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were seated on their seats of authority dressed in their robes by the doorway into Samaria and all the prophets were acting as prophets before them
Ki  And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made himself horns of iron and said The Lord says Pushing back the Aramaeans with these you will put an end to them completely
Ki  And all the prophets said the same thing saying Go up to Ramothgilead and it will go well for you for the Lord will give it into the hands of the king
Ki  Now the servant who had gone to get Micaiah said to him See now all the prophets with one voice are saying good things to the king so let your words be like theirs and say good things
Ki  And Micaiah said By the living Lord whatever the Lord says to me I will say
Ki  When he came to the king the king said to him Micaiah are we to go to Ramothgilead to make war or not And in answer he said Go up and it will go well for you and the Lord will give it into the hands of the king
Ki  Then the king said to him Have I not again and again put you on your oath to say nothing to me but what is true in the name of the Lord
Ki  Then he said I saw all Israel wandering on the mountains like sheep without a keeper and the Lord said These have no master let them go back every man to his house in peace
Ki  And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat Did I not say that he would not be a prophet of good but of evil
Ki  And he said Give ear now to the word of the Lord I saw the Lord seated on his seat of power with all the army of heaven in their places round him at his right hand and at his left
Ki  And the Lord said How may Ahab be tricked into going up to Ramothgilead to his death And one said one thing and one another
Ki  Then a spirit came forward and took his place before the Lord and said I will get him to do it by a trick
Ki  And the Lord said How And he said I will go out and be a spirit of deceit in the mouth of all his prophets And he said Your trick will have its effect on him go out and do so
Ki  And now see the Lord has put a spirit of deceit in the mouth of all these your prophets and the Lord has said evil against you
Ki  Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near and gave Micaiah a blow on the side of the face saying Where is the spirit of the Lord whose word is in you
Ki  And Micaiah said Truly you will see on that day when you go into an inner room to keep yourself safe
Ki  And the king of Israel said Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon the ruler of the town and to Joash the kings son
Ki  And say It is the kings order that this man is to be put in prison and given prison food till I come again in peace
Ki  And Micaiah said If you come back at all in peace the Lord has not sent his word by me
Ki  So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead
Ki  And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat I will make a change in my clothing so that I do not seem to be the king and will go into the fight but do you put on your robes So the king of Israel made a change in his dress and went into the fight
Ki  Now the king of Aram had given orders to the thirtytwo captains of his warcarriages saying Make no attack on small or great but only on the king of Israel
Ki  So when the captains of the warcarriages saw Jehoshaphat they said Truly this is the king of Israel and turning against him they came round him but Jehoshaphat gave a cry
Ki  And when the captains of the warcarriages saw that he was not the king of Israel they went back from going after him
Ki  And a certain man sent an arrow from his bow without thought of its direction and gave the king of Israel a wound where his breastplate was joined to his clothing so he said to the driver of his warcarriage Go to one side and take me away out of the army for I am badly wounded
Ki  But the fight became more violent while the day went on and the king was supported in his warcarriage facing the Aramaeans and the floor of the carriage was covered with the blood from his wound and by evening he was dead
Ki  And about sundown a cry went up from all parts of the army saying Let every man go back to his town and his country for the king is dead
Ki  And they came to Samaria and put the kings body to rest in Samaria
Ki  And the warcarriage was washed by the pool of Samaria which was the bathingplace of the loose women and the dogs were drinking his blood there as the Lord had said
Ki  Now the rest of the acts of Ahab and all he did and his ivory house and all the towns of which he was the builder are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel
Ki  So Ahab was put to rest with his fathers and Ahaziah his son became king in his place
Ki  And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa became king over Judah in the fourth year of Ahabs rule over Israel
Ki  Jehoshaphat was thirtyfive years old when he became king and he was king for twentyfive years in Jerusalem His mothers name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi
Ki  He did as Asa his father had done not turning away from it but doing what was right in the eyes of the Lord but the high places were not taken away the people went on making offerings and burning them in the high places
Ki  And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel
Ki  Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat and his great power and how he went to war are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah
Ki  He put an end to the rest of those who were used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods all those who were still in the land in the time of his father Asa
Ki  At that time there was no king in Edom
Ki  And the representative of King Jehoshaphat made a Tarshishship to go to Ophir for gold but it did not go because it was broken at Eziongeber
Ki  Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat Let my men go with yours in the ships But Jehoshaphat would not let them
Ki  Then Jehoshaphat went to rest with his fathers and his body was put into the earth in the town of David his father and Jehoram his son became king in his place
Ki  Ahaziah the son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of the rule of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah and he was king over Israel for two years
Ki  He did evil in the eyes of the Lord going in the ways of his father and his mother and in the ways of Jeroboam the son of Nebat who made Israel do evil
Ki  He was a servant and worshipper of Baal moving the Lord the God of Israel to wrath as his father had done
Ki  After the death of Ahab Moab made itself free from the authority of Israel
Ki  Now Ahaziah had a fall from the window of his room in Samaria and was ill And he sent men and said to them Put a question to Baalzebub the god of Ekron about the outcome of my disease to see if I will get well or not
Ki  But the angel of the Lord said to Elijah the Tishbite Go now and meeting the men sent by the king of Samaria say to them Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to get directions from Baalzebub the god of Ekron
Ki  Give ear then to the words of the Lord You will never again get down from the bed on to which you have gone up but death will certainly come to you Then Elijah went away
Ki  And the men he had sent came back to the king and he said to them Why have you come back
Ki  And they said to him On our way we had a meeting with a man who said Go back to the king who sent you and say to him The Lord says Is it because there is no God in Israel that you send to put a question to Baalzebub the god of Ekron For this reason you will not come down from the bed on to which you have gone up but death will certainly come to you
Ki  And he said to them What sort of a man was it who came and said these words to you
Ki  And they said in answer He was a man clothed in a coat of hair with a leather band about his body Then he said It is Elijah the Tishbite
Ki  Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty men and he went up to him where he was seated on the top of a hill and said to him O man of God the king has said Come down
Ki  And Elijah in answer said to the captain of fifty If I am a man of God may fire come down from heaven on you and on your fifty men and put an end to you Then fire came down from heaven and put an end to him and his fifty men
Ki  Then the king sent another captain of fifty with his fifty men and he said to Elijah O man of God the king says Come down quickly
Ki  And Elijah in answer said If I am a man of God may fire come down from heaven on you and on your fifty men and put an end to you And the fire of God came down from heaven and put an end to him and his fifty men
Ki  Then he sent a third captain of fifty with his fifty men and the third captain of fifty went up and falling on his knees before Elijah requesting mercy of him said O man of God let my life and the life of these your fifty servants be of value to you
Ki  For fire came down from heaven and put an end to the first two captains of fifty and their fifties but now let my life be of value in your eyes
Ki  Then the angel of the Lord said to Elijah Go down with him have no fear of him So he got up and went down with him to the king
Ki  And he said to him This is the word of the Lord Because you sent men to put a question to Baalzebub the god of Ekron for this reason you will never again get down from the bed on to which you have gone up but death will certainly come to you
Ki  So death came to him as the Lord had said by the mouth of Elijah And Jehoram became king in his place in the second year of the rule of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah because he had no son
Ki  Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel
Ki  Now when the Lord was about to take Elijah up to heaven in a great wind Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal
Ki  And Elijah said to Elisha Come no farther for the Lord has sent me to Bethel But Elisha said As the Lord is living and as your soul is living I will not be parted from you So they went down to Bethel
Ki  And at Bethel the sons of the prophets came out to Elisha and said Has it been made clear to you that the Lord is going to take away your master from over you today And he said Yes I have knowledge of it say no more
Ki  Then Elijah said to him Come no farther for the Lord has sent me to Jericho But he said As the Lord is living and as your soul is living I will not be parted from you So they went on to Jericho
Ki  And at Jericho the sons of the prophets came up to Elisha and said to him Has it been made clear to you that the Lord is going to take away your master from over you today And he said in answer Yes I have knowledge of it say no more
Ki  Then Elijah said to him Come no farther for the Lord has sent me to Jordan But he said As the Lord is living and as your soul is living I will not be parted from you So they went on together
Ki  And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went out and took their places facing them a long way off while the two of them were by the edge of Jordan
Ki  Then Elijah took off his robe and rolling it up gave the water a blow with it and the waters were parted flowing back this way and that so that they went over on dry land
Ki  And when they had come to the other side Elijah said to Elisha Say what you would have me do for you before I am taken from you And Elisha said Be pleased to let a special measure of your spirit be on me
Ki  And he said You have made a hard request still if you see me when I am taken from you you will get your desire but if not it will not be so
Ki  And while they went on their way going on talking together suddenly there were carriages and horses of fire separating them from one another and Elijah went up to heaven in a great wind
Ki  And when Elisha saw it he gave a cry My father my father the carriages of Israel and its horsemen And he saw him no longer and he was full of grief
Ki  Then he took up Elijahs robe which had been dropped from him and went back till he came to the edge of Jordan
Ki  And he took Elijahs robe which had been dropped from him and giving the water a blow with it said Where is the Lord the God of Elijah and at his blow the waters were parted this way and that and Elisha went over
Ki  And when the sons of the prophets who were facing him at Jericho saw him they said The spirit of Elijah is resting on Elisha And they came out to him and went down on the earth before him
Ki  And they said Your servants have with us here fifty strong men be pleased to let them go in search of Elijah for it may be that the spirit of the Lord has taken him up and put him down on some mountain or in some valley But he said Do not send them
Ki  But when they kept on requesting him he was shamed and said Send then So they sent fifty men but after searching for three days they came back without having seen him
Ki  And they came back to him while he was still at Jericho and he said to them Did I not say to you Go not
Ki  Now the men of the town said to Elisha You see that the position of this town is good but the water is bad causing the young of the cattle to come to birth dead
Ki  So he said Get me a new vessel and put salt in it and they took it to him
Ki  Then he went out to the spring from which the water came and put salt in it and said The Lord says Now I have made this water sweet no longer will it be deathgiving or unfertile
Ki  And the water was made sweet again to this day as Elisha said
Ki  Then from there he went up to Bethel and on his way some little boys came out from the town and made sport of him crying Go up old nohair go up old nohair
Ki  And turning back he saw them and put a curse on them in the name of the Lord And two shebears came out of the wood and put fortytwo of the children to death
Ki  From there he went to Mount Carmel and came back from there to Samaria
Ki  And Jehoram the son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of the rule of Jehoshaphat king of Judah and he was king for twelve years
Ki  He did evil in the eyes of the Lord but not like his father and his mother for he put away the stone pillar of Baal which his father had made
Ki  But still he did the same sins which Jeroboam the son of Nebat did and made Israel do he went on in them
Ki  Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheepfarmer and he gave regularly to the king of Israel the wool from a hundred thousand lambs and a hundred thousand sheep
Ki  But when Ahab was dead the king of Moab got free from the authority of the king of Israel
Ki  At that time King Jehoram went out from Samaria and got all Israel together in fighting order
Ki  And he sent to Jehoshaphat king of Judah saying The king of Moab has got free from my authority will you go with me to make war on Moab And he said I will go with you I am as you are my people as your people and my horses as your horses
Ki  And he said Which way are we to go And he said in answer By the waste land of Edom
Ki  So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom by a roundabout way for seven days and there was no water for the army or for the beasts they had with them
Ki  And the king of Israel said Here is trouble for the Lord has got these three kings together to give them into the hands of Moab
Ki  But Jehoshaphat said Is there no prophet of the Lord here through whom we may get directions from the Lord And one of the king of Israels men said in answer Elisha the son of Shaphat is here who was servant to Elijah
Ki  And Jehoshaphat said The word of the Lord is with him So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him
Ki  But Elisha said to the king of Israel What have I to do with you go to the prophets of your father and your mother And the king of Israel said No for the Lord has got these three kings together to give them up into the hands of Moab
Ki  Then Elisha said By the life of the Lord of armies whose servant I am if it was not for the respect I have for Jehoshaphat king of Judah I would not give a look at you or see you
Ki  But now get me a player of music and it will come about that while the man is playing the hand of the Lord will come on me and I will give you the word of the Lord and they got a player of music and while the man was playing the hand of the Lord was on him
Ki  And he said The Lord says I will make this valley full of waterholes
Ki  For the Lord says Though you see no wind or rain the valley will be full of water and you and your armies and your beasts will have drink
Ki  And this will be only a small thing to the Lord in addition he will give the Moabites into your hands
Ki  And you are to put every walled town to destruction cutting down every good tree and stopping up every waterspring and making all the good land rough with stones
Ki  Now in the morning about the time when the offering was made they saw water flowing from the direction of Edom till the country was full of water
Ki  Now all Moab hearing that the kings had come to make war against them got together all who were able to take up arms and went forward to the edge of the country
Ki  And early in the morning they got up when the sun was shining on the water and they saw the water facing them as red as blood
Ki  Then they said This is blood it is clear that destruction has come on the kings they have been fighting one another now come Moab let us take their goods
Ki  But when they came to the tents of Israel the Israelites came out and made a violent attack on the Moabites so that they went in flight before them and they went forward still attacking them
Ki  Pulling down the towns covering every good field with stones stopping up all the watersprings and cutting down all the good trees they went on driving Moab before them till only in Kirhareseth were there any Moabites and the fightingmen went round the town raining stones on it
Ki  And when the king of Moab saw that the fight was going against him he took with him seven hundred men armed with swords with the idea of forcing a way through to the king of Aram but they were not able to do so
Ki  Then he took his oldest son who would have been king after him offering him as a burned offering on the wall So there was great wrath against Israel and they went away from him back to their country
Ki  Now a certain woman the wife of one of the sons of the prophets came crying to Elisha and said Your servant my husband is dead and to your knowledge he was a worshipper of the Lord but now the creditor has come to take my two children as servants in payment of his debt
Ki  Then Elisha said to her What am I to do for you say now what have you in the house And she said Your servant has nothing in the house but a pot of oil
Ki  Then he said Go out to all your neighbours and get vessels a very great number of them
Ki  Then go in and shutting the door on yourself and your sons put oil into all these vessels putting on one side the full ones
Ki  So she went away and when the door was shut on her and her sons they took the vessels to her and she put oil into them
Ki  And when all the vessels were full she said to her son Get me another vessel And he said There are no more And the flow of oil was stopped
Ki  So she came to the man of God and gave him word of what she had done And he said Go and get money for the oil and make payment of your debt and let the rest be for the needs of yourself and your sons
Ki  Now there came a day when Elisha went to Shunem and there was a woman of high position living there who made him come in and have a meal with her And after that every time he went by he went into her house for a meal
Ki  And she said to her husband Now I see that this is a holy man of God who comes by day after day
Ki  So let us make a little room on the wall and put a bed there for him and a table and a seat and a light so that when he comes to us he will be able to go in there
Ki  Now one day when he had gone there he went into the little room and took his rest there
Ki  And he said to Gehazi his servant Send for this Shunammite So in answer to his voice she came before him
Ki  And he said to him Now say to her See you have taken all this trouble for us what is to be done for you will you have any request made for you to the king or the captain of the army But she said I am living among my people
Ki  So he said What then is to be done for her And Gehazi made answer Still there is this she has no son and her husband is old
Ki  Then he said Send for her And in answer to his voice she took her place at the door
Ki  And Elisha said At this time in the coming year you will have a son in your arms And she said No my lord O man of God do not say what is false to your servant
Ki  Then the woman became with child and gave birth to a son at the time named in the year after as Elisha had said to her
Ki  Now one day when the child was older he went out to his father to where the grain was being cut
Ki  And he said to his father My head my head And the father said to a servant Take him in to his mother
Ki  And he took him in to his mother and she took him on her knees and kept him there till the middle of the day when his life went from him
Ki  Then she went up and put him on the bed of the man of God shutting the door on him and went out
Ki  And she said to her husband Send me one of the servants and one of the asses so that I may go quickly to the man of God and come back again
Ki  And he said Why are you going to him today it is not a new moon or a Sabbath But she said It is well
Ki  Then she made the ass ready and said to her servant Keep driving on do not make a stop without orders from me
Ki  So she went and came to Mount Carmel to the man of God And when the man of God saw her coming in his direction he said to Gehazi his servant See there is the Shunammite
Ki  Go quickly to her and on meeting her say to her Are you well and your husband and the child are they well And she said in answer All is well
Ki  And when she came to where the man of God was on the hill she put her hands round his feet and Gehazi came near with the purpose of pushing her away but the man of God said Let her be for her soul is bitter in her and the Lord has kept it secret from me and has not given me word of it
Ki  Then she said Did I make a request to my lord for a son did I not say Do not give me false words
Ki  Then he said to Gehazi Make yourself ready and take my stick in your hand and go if you come across anyone on the way give him no blessing and if anyone gives you a blessing give him no answer And put my stick on the childs face
Ki  But the mother of the child said As the Lord is living and as your soul is living I will not go back without you So he got up and went with her
Ki  And Gehazi went on before them and put the stick on the childs face but there was no voice and no one gave attention So he went back and meeting him gave him the news saying The child is not awake
Ki  And when Elisha came into the house he saw the child dead stretched on his bed
Ki  So he went in and shutting the door on the two of them made prayer to the Lord
Ki  Then he got up on the bed stretching himself out on the child and put his mouth on the childs mouth his eyes on his eyes and his hands on his hands and the childs body became warm
Ki  Then he came back and after walking once through the house and back he went up stretching himself out on the child seven times and the childs eyes became open
Ki  And he gave orders to Gehazi and said Send for the Shunammite And she came in answer to his voice And he said Take up your son
Ki  And she came in and went down on her face to the earth at his feet then she took her son in her arms and went out
Ki  And Elisha went back to Gilgal now there was very little food in the land and the sons of the prophets were seated before him And he said to his servant Put the great pot on the fire and make soup for the sons of the prophets
Ki  And one went out into the field to get green plants and saw a vine of the field and pulling off the fruit of it till the fold of his robe was full he came back and put the fruit cut up small into the pot of soup having no idea what it was
Ki  Then they gave the men soup from the pot And while they were drinking the soup they gave a cry and said O man of God there is death in the pot and they were not able to take any more food
Ki  But he said Get some meal And he put it into the pot and said Now give it to the people so that they may have food And there was nothing bad in the pot
Ki  Now a man came from Baalshalishah with an offering of firstfruits for the man of God twenty barley cakes and garden fruit in his bag And he said Give these to the people for food
Ki  But his servant said How am I to put this before a hundred men But he said Give it to the people for food for the Lord says There will be food for them and some over
Ki  So he put it before them and they had a meal and there was more than enough as the Lord had said
Ki  Now Naaman chief of the army of the king of Aram was a man of high position with his master and greatly respected because by him the Lord had given salvation to Aram but he was a leper
Ki  Now the Aramaeans had gone out in bands and taken prisoner from Israel a little girl who became servant to Naamans wife
Ki  And she said to her masters wife If only my lord would go to the prophet in Samaria he would make him well
Ki  And someone went and said to his lord This is what the girl from the land of Israel says
Ki  So the king of Aram said Go then and I will send a letter to the king of Israel And he went taking with him ten talents of silver and six thousand shekels of gold and ten changes of clothing
Ki  And he took the letter to the king of Israel in which the king of Aram had said See I have sent my servant Naaman to you to be made well for he is a leper
Ki  But the king of Israel after reading the letter was greatly troubled and said Am I God to give death and life why does this man send a leper to me to be made well is it not clear that he is looking for a cause of war
Ki  Now Elisha the man of God hearing that the king of Israel had done this sent to the king saying Why are you troubled send the man to me so that he may see that there is a prophet in Israel
Ki  So Naaman with all his horses and his carriages came to the door of Elishas house
Ki  And Elisha sent a servant to him saying Go to Jordan and after washing seven times in its waters your flesh will be well again and you will be clean
Ki  But Naaman was angry and went away and said I had the idea that he would come out to see such an important person as I am and make prayer to the Lord his God and with a wave of his hand over the place make the leper well
Ki  Are not Abana and Pharpar rivers of Damascus better than all the waters of Israel may I not be washed in them and become clean So turning he went away in wrath
Ki  Then his servants came to him and said If the prophet had given you orders to do some great thing would you not have done it how much more then when he says to you Be washed and become clean
Ki  Then he went down seven times into the waters of Jordan as the man of God had said and his flesh became like the flesh of a little child again and he was clean
Ki  Then he went back to the man of God with all his train and taking his place before him said Now I am certain that there is no God in all the earth but only in Israel now then take an offering from me
Ki  But he said By the life of the Lord whose servant I am I will take nothing from you And he did his best to make him take it but he would not
Ki  Then Naaman said If you will not then let there be given to your servant as much earth as two beasts are able to take on their backs because from now on your servant will make no offering or burned offering to other gods but only to the Lord
Ki  But may your servant have the Lords forgiveness for this one thing when my master goes into the house of Rimmon for worship there supported on my arm and my head is bent in the house of Rimmon when his head is bent in the house of Rimmon may your servant have the Lords forgiveness for this thing
Ki  And he said to him Go in peace And he went from him some distance
Ki  But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God said Now my master has taken nothing from Naaman this Aramaean of what he would have given him by the living Lord I will go after him and get something from him
Ki  So Gehazi went after Naaman And when Naaman saw him running after him he got down from his carriage and went back to him and said Is all well
Ki  And he said All is well but my master has sent me saying Even now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hillcountry of Ephraim will you give me a talent of silver and two changes of clothing for them
Ki  And Naaman said Be good enough to take two talents And forcing him to take them he put two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of clothing and gave them to his two servants to take before him
Ki  When he came to the hill he took them from their hands and put them away in the house and he sent the men away and they went
Ki  Then he came in and took his place before his master And Elisha said to him Where have you come from Gehazi And he said Your servant went nowhere
Ki  And he said to him Did not my heart go with you when the man got down from his carriage and went back to you Is this a time for getting money and clothing and olivegardens and vinegardens and sheep and oxen and menservants and womenservants
Ki  Because of what you have done the disease of Naaman the leper will take you in its grip and your seed after you for ever And he went out from before him a leper as white as snow
Ki  Now the sons of the prophets said to Elisha There is not room enough for us in the place where we are living under your care
Ki  So let us go to Jordan and let everyone get to work cutting boards and we will make a livingplace for ourselves there And he said to them Go then
Ki  And one of them said Be pleased to go with your servants And he said I will go
Ki  So he went with them And when they came to Jordan they got to work cutting down trees
Ki  But one of them while cutting a board let the head of his axe go into the water and he gave a cry and said This is a bad business my master for it is anothers
Ki  And the man of God said Where did it go in and when he saw the place where it had gone into the water cutting a stick he put it into the water and the iron came up to the top of the water
Ki  Then he said Take it up So he put out his hand and took it
Ki  At that time the king of Aram was making war against Israel and he had a meeting with the chiefs of his army and said I will be waiting in secret in some named place
Ki  And the man of God sent to the king of Israel saying Take care to keep away from that place for the Aramaeans are waiting there in secret
Ki  So the king of Israel sent to the place where the man of God had said there was danger and kept clear of it more than once
Ki  And at this the mind of the king of Aram was greatly troubled and he sent for his servants and said to them Will you not make clear to me which of us is helping the king of Israel
Ki  And one of them said Not one of us my lord king but Elisha the prophet in Israel gives the king of Israel news of the words you say even in your bedroom
Ki  Then he said Go and see where he is so that I may send and get him And news came to him that he was in Dothan
Ki  So he sent there horses and carriages and a great army and they came by night circling the town
Ki  Now the servant of the man of God having got up early and gone out saw an army with horses and carriages of war all round the town And the servant said to him O my master what are we to do
Ki  And he said in answer Have no fear those who are with us are more than those who are with them
Ki  Then Elisha made a prayer to the Lord saying Lord let his eyes be open so that he may see And the Lord made the young mans eyes open and he saw that all the mountain was full of horses and carriages of fire round Elisha
Ki  Now when the Aramaeans came down to Elisha he made a prayer to the Lord saying Lord make this people blind And he made them blind at Elishas request
Ki  And Elisha said to them This is not the way and this is not the town come after me so that I may take you to the man you are searching for And he took them to Samaria
Ki  And when they had come into Samaria Elisha said Lord let the eyes of these men be open so that they may see And the Lord made their eyes open and they saw that they were in the middle of Samaria
Ki  And the king of Israel when he saw them said to Elisha My father am I to put them to the sword
Ki  But he said in answer You are not to put them to death have you any right to put to death those whom you have not taken prisoner with your sword and your bow put bread and water before them so that they may have food and drink and go to their master
Ki  So he made ready a great feast for them and when they had had food and drink he sent them away and they went back to their master And no more bands of Aramaeans came into the land of Israel
Ki  Now after this Benhadad king of Aram got together all his army and went up to make an attack on Samaria shutting the town in on all sides with his forces
Ki  And they became very short of food in Samaria for they kept it shut in till the price of an asss head was eighty shekels of silver and a small measure of doves droppings was five shekels of silver
Ki  And when the king of Israel was going by on the wall a woman came crying out to him and said Help my lord king
Ki  And he said If the Lord does not give you help where am I to get help for you from the grainfloor or the grapecrusher
Ki  And the king said to her What is troubling you And she said in answer This woman said to me Give your son to be our food today and we will have my son tomorrow
Ki  So boiling my son we had a meal of him and on the day after I said to her Now give your son for our food but she has put her son in a secret place
Ki  Then the king hearing what the woman said took his robes in his hands violently parting them and while he was walking on the wall the people looking saw that under his robe he had haircloth on his flesh
Ki  Then he said May Gods punishment come on me if Elisha the son of Shaphat keeps his head on his body after this day
Ki  But Elisha was in his house and the responsible men were seated there with him and before the king got there Elisha said to those who were with him Do you see how this cruel and violent man has sent to take away my life
Ki  While he was still talking to them the king came down and said This evil is from the Lord why am I to go on waiting any longer for the Lord
Ki  Then Elisha said Give ear to the word of the Lord the Lord says Tomorrow about this time a measure of good meal will be offered for the price of a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel in the marketplace of Samaria
Ki  Then the captain whose arm was supporting the king said to the man of God Even if the Lord made windows in heaven would such a thing be possible And he said Your eyes will see it but you will not have a taste of the food
Ki  Now there were four lepers seated at the doorway into the town and they said to one another Why are we waiting here for death
Ki  If we say We will go into the town there is no food in the town and we will come to our end there and if we go on waiting here death will come to us Come then let us give ourselves up to the army of Aram if they let us go on living then life will be ours and if they put us to death then death will be ours
Ki  So in the half light they got up to go to the tents of Aram but when they came to the outer line of tents there was no one there
Ki  For the Lord had made the sound of carriages and horses and the noise of a great army come to the ears of the Aramaeans so that they said to one another Truly the king of Israel has got the kings of the Hittites and of the Egyptians for a price to make an attack on us
Ki  So they got up and went in flight in the half light without their tents or their horses or their asses or any of their goods they went in flight fearing for their lives
Ki  And when those lepers came to the outer line of tents they went into one tent and had food and drink and took from it silver and gold and clothing which they put in a secret place then they came back and went into another tent from which they took more goods which they put away in a secret place
Ki  Then they said to one another We are not doing right Today is a day of good news and we say nothing if we go on waiting here till the morning punishment will come to us So let us go and give the news to those of the kings house
Ki  So they came in and crying out to the doorkeepers of the town they gave them the news saying We came to the tents of the Aramaeans and there was no one there and no voice of man only the horses and the asses in their places and the tents as they were
Ki  Then the doorkeepers crying out gave the news to those inside the kings house
Ki  Then the king got up in the night and said to his servants This is my idea of what the Aramaeans have done to us They have knowledge that we are without food and so they have gone out of their tents and are waiting secretly in the open country saying When they come out of the town we will take them living and get into the town
Ki  And one of his servants said in answer Send men and let them take five of the horses which we still have in the town if they keep their lives they will be the same as those of Israel who are still living here if they come to their death they will be the same as all those of Israel who have gone to destruction let us send and see
Ki  So they took two horsemen and the king sent them after the army of the Aramaeans saying Go and see
Ki  And they went after them as far as Jordan and all the road was covered with clothing and vessels dropped by the Aramaeans in their flight So those who were sent went back and gave the news to the king
Ki  Then the people went out and took the goods from the tents of the Aramaeans So a measure of good meal was to be had for the price of a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel as the Lord had said
Ki  And the king gave authority to that captain on whose arm he was supported to have control over the doorway into the town but he was crushed to death there under the feet of the people as the man of God had said when the king went down to him
Ki  So the words of the man of God came true which he said to the king Two measures of barley will be offered for the price of a shekel and a measure of good meal for a shekel tomorrow about this time in the marketplace of Samaria
Ki  And that captain said to the man of God Even if the Lord made windows in heaven would such a thing be possible And he said to him Your eyes will see it but you will not have a taste of the food
Ki  And such was his fate for he was crushed to death under the feet of the people in the doorway into the town
Ki  Now Elisha had said to the woman whose son he had given back to life Go now with all the people of your house and get a livingplace for yourselves wherever you are able for by the word of the Lord there will be great need of food in the land and this will go on for seven years
Ki  So the woman got up and did as the man of God said and she and the people of her house were living in the land of the Philistines for seven years
Ki  And when the seven years were ended the woman came back from the land of the Philistines and went to the king with a request for her house and her land
Ki  Now the king was talking with Gehazi the servant of the man of God saying Now give me an account of all the great things Elisha has done
Ki  And while he was giving the king the story of how Elisha had given life to the dead the woman whose son had come back to life came to the king with a request for her house and her land And Gehazi said My lord king this is the woman and this is her son whose life Elisha gave back to him
Ki  And in answer to the kings questions the woman gave him all the story So the king gave orders to one of his unsexed servants saying Give her back all her property and all the produce of her fields from the day when she went away from the land up till now
Ki  And Elisha came to Damascus and Benhadad king of Aram was ill and they said to him The man of God has come
Ki  Then the king said to Hazael Take an offering with you and go to see the man of God and get directions from the Lord by him saying Am I going to get better from my disease
Ki  So Hazael went to see him taking with him forty camels with offerings on their backs of every sort of good thing from Damascus and when he came before him he said Your son Benhadad king of Aram has sent me to you saying Will I get better from this disease
Ki  And Elisha said to him Go say to him You will certainly get better but the Lord has made it clear to me that only death is before him
Ki  And he kept his eyes fixed on him till he was shamed and the man of God was overcome with weeping
Ki  And Hazael said Why is my lord weeping Then he said in answer Because I see the evil which you will do to the children of Israel burning down their strong towns putting their young men to death with the sword smashing their little ones against the stones and cutting open the women who are with child
Ki  And Hazael said How is it possible that your servant who is only a dog will do this great thing And Elisha said The Lord has made it clear to me that you will be king over Aram
Ki  Then he went away from Elisha and came in to his master who said to him What did Elisha say to you And his answer was He said that you would certainly get well
Ki  Now on the day after Hazael took the bedcover and making it wet with water put it over Benhadads face causing his death and Hazael became king in his place
Ki  In the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah became king
Ki  He was thirtytwo years old when he became king and he was ruling in Jerusalem for eight years
Ki  He went in the ways of the kings of Israel as the family of Ahab did for the daughter of Ahab was his wife and he did evil in the eyes of the Lord
Ki  But it was not the Lords purpose to send destruction on Judah because of David his servant to whom he had given his word that he would have a light for ever
Ki  In his time Edom made themselves free from the rule of Judah and took a king for themselves
Ki  Then Joram went over to Zair with all his warcarriages  made an attack by night on the Edomites whose forces were all round him  the captains of the warcarriages and the people went in flight to their tents
Ki  So Edom made themselves free from the rule of Judah to this day And at the same time Libnah made itself free
Ki  Now the rest of the acts of Joram and all he did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah
Ki  And Joram went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth with his fathers in the town of David and Ahaziah his son became king in his place
Ki  In the twelfth year that Joram the son of Ahab was king of Israel Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah became king
Ki  Ahaziah was twentytwo years old when he became king and he was ruling in Jerusalem for one year His mothers name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel
Ki  He went in the ways of the family of Ahab and did evil in the eyes of the Lord as the family of Ahab did for he was a soninlaw of the family of Ahab
Ki  He went with Joram the son of Ahab to make war on Hazael king of Aram at Ramothgilead and Joram was wounded by the Aramaeans
Ki  So King Joram went back to Jezreel to get well from the wounds which the bowmen had given him at Ramah when he was fighting against Hazael king of Aram And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel because he was ill
Ki  And Elisha the prophet sent for one of the sons of the prophets and said to him Make yourself ready for a journey and take this bottle of oil in your hand and go to Ramothgilead
Ki  And when you get there go in search of Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi and go in and make him get up from among his brothers and take him to an inner room
Ki  Then take the bottle and put the oil on his head and say The Lord says I have put the holy oil on you to make you king over Israel Then opening the door go in flight without waiting
Ki  So the young prophet went to Ramothgilead
Ki  And when he came he saw the captains of the army seated together and he said I have something to say to you O captain And Jehu said To which of us And he said To you O captain
Ki  And he got up and went into the house then he put the holy oil on his head and said to him The Lord the God of Israel says I have made you king over the people of the Lord over Israel
Ki  You are to see that the family of Ahab your master is cut off so that I may take from Jezebel payment for the blood of my servants the prophets and for the blood of all the servants of the Lord
Ki  For the family of Ahab will come to an end every male of Ahabs family will be cut off he who is shut up and he who goes free in Israel
Ki  I will make the family of Ahab like that of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and Baasha the son of Ahijah
Ki  And Jezebel will become food for the dogs in the heritage of Jezreel and there will be no one to put her body into the earth Then opening the door he went in flight
Ki  Then Jehu came out again to the servants of his lord and one said to him Is all well why did this man who is off his head come to you And he said to them You have knowledge of the man and of his talk
Ki  And they said That is not true now give us his story Then he said This is what he said to me The Lord says I have made you king over Israel
Ki  Then straight away everyone took his robe and put it under him on the top of the steps and sounding the horn they said Jehu is king
Ki  So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi made designs against Joram Now Joram and all the army of Israel were keeping watch on Ramothgilead because of Hazael king of Aram
Ki  But King Joram had gone back to Jezreel to get well from the wounds which the Aramaeans had given him when he was fighting against Hazael king of Aram And Jehu said If this is your purpose then let no one get away and go out of the town to give news of it in Jezreel
Ki  So Jehu got into his carriage and went to Jezreel for Joram was ill in bed there and Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram
Ki  And the watchman on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehu and his band coming and said I see a band of people And Joram said Send out a horseman to them and let him say Is it peace
Ki  So a horseman went out to them and said The king says Is it peace And Jehu said What have you to do with peace come after me And the watchman gave them word saying The horseman went up to them but has not come back
Ki  Then he sent out a second horseman who came up to them and said The king says Is it peace And Jehu said in answer What have you to do with peace come after me
Ki  And the watchman gave them word saying He went up to them and has not come back again and the driving is like the driving of Jehu son of Nimshi for he is driving violently
Ki  Then Joram said Make ready So they made his carriage ready and Joram king of Israel with Ahaziah king of Judah went out in their carriages for the purpose of meeting Jehu and they came face to face with him at the field of Naboth the Jezreelite
Ki  Now when Joram saw Jehu he said Is it peace Jehu And he said in answer What peace is possible while all the land is full of the disgusting sins of your mother Jezebel and her secret arts
Ki  Then Joram turning his horses in flight said to Ahaziah Broken faith O Ahaziah
Ki  Then Jehu took his bow in his hand and with all his strength sent an arrow wounding Joram between the arms and the arrow came out at his heart and he went down on his face in his carriage
Ki  Then Jehu said to Bidkar his captain Take him up and put him in the field of Naboth the Jezreelite for is not that day in your memory when you and I together on our horses were going after Ahab his father and the Lord put this fate on him saying
Ki  I saw the blood of Naboth and of his sons yesterday and I will give you full payment in this field says the Lord So now take him and put him in this field as the Lord said
Ki  Now when Ahaziah king of Judah saw this he went in flight by the way of the garden house And Jehu came after him and said Put him to death in the same way and they gave him a deathwound in his carriage on the slope up to Gur by Ibleam and he went in flight to Megiddo where death came to him
Ki  And his servants took him in a carriage to Jerusalem and put him into the earth with his fathers in the town of David
Ki  In the eleventh year of the rule of Joram the son of Ahab Ahaziah became king over Judah
Ki  And when Jehu came to Jezreel Jezebel had news of it and painting her eyes and dressing her hair with ornaments she put her head out of the window
Ki  And when Jehu was coming into the town she said Is all well O Zimri taker of your masters life
Ki  Then looking up to the window he said Who is on my side who and two or three unsexed servants put out their heads
Ki  And he said Take her and put her out of the window So they sent her down with force and her blood went in a shower on the wall and on the horses and she was crushed under their feet
Ki  And he came in and took food and drink then he said Now see to this cursed woman and put her body into the earth for she is a kings daughter
Ki  And they went out to put her body into the earth but nothing of her was to be seen only the bones of her head and her feet and parts of her hands
Ki  So they came back and gave him word of it And he said This is what the Lord said by his servant Elijah the Tishbite saying In the heritage of Jezreel the flesh of Jezebel will become food for dogs
Ki  And the dead body of Jezebel will be like waste dropped on the face of the earth in the heritage of Jezreel so that they will not be able to say This is Jezebel
Ki  Now there were in Samaria seventy of Ahabs sons And Jehu sent letters to Samaria to the rulers of the town and to the responsible men and to those who had the care of the sons of Ahab saying
Ki  Straight away when you get this letter seeing that your masters sons are with you and that you have carriages and horses and a walled town and arms
Ki  Take the best and most upright of your masters sons and make him king in his fathers place and put up a fight for your masters family
Ki  But they were full of fear and said The two kings have gone down before him how may we keep our place
Ki  So the controller of the kings house with the ruler of the town and the responsible men and those who had the care of Ahabs sons sent to Jehu saying We are your servants and will do all your orders we will not make any man king do whatever seems best to you
Ki  Then he sent them a second letter saying If you are on my side and if you will do my orders come to me at Jezreel by this time tomorrow with the heads of your masters sons Now the kings seventy sons were with the great men of the town who had the care of them
Ki  And when the letter came to them they took the kings sons and put them to death all the seventy and put their heads in baskets and sent them to him at Jezreel
Ki  And a man came and said to him They have come with the heads of the kings sons And he said Put them down in two masses at the doorway of the town till the morning
Ki  And in the morning he went out and stopping said to all the people there You are upright men it is true that I made designs against my master and put him to death but who is responsible for the death of all these
Ki  You may be certain that nothing which the Lord has said about the family of Ahab will be without effect for the Lord has done what he said by his servant Elijah
Ki  So Jehu put to death all the rest of the seed of Ahab in Jezreel and all his relations and his near friends and his priests till there were no more of them
Ki  Then he got up and came to Samaria And he was at the meetingplace of the keepers of sheep by the way
Ki  When he came across the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah and said Who are you And they said We are the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah we are going down to see the children of the king and of the queen
Ki  And he said Take them living So they took them living and put them to death in the waterhole of Betheked of the fortytwo men he put every one to death
Ki  And when he had gone away from there he came across Jehonadab the son of Rechab and he said goodday to him and said to him Is your heart true to mine as mine is to yours And Jehonadab in answer said It is and Jehu said If it is give me your hand And he gave him his hand and he made him come up into his carriage
Ki  And he said Come with me and see how I am on fire for the Lords cause So he made him go with him in his carriage
Ki  And when he came to Samaria he put to death all those of Ahabs family who were still in Samaria till there were no more of them as the Lord had said to Elijah
Ki  Then Jehu got all the people together and said to them Ahab was Baals servant in a small way but Jehu will be his servant on a great scale
Ki  Now send for all the prophets of Baal and all his servants and all his priests to come to me let no one keep away for I have a great offering to make to Baal anyone who is not present will be put to death This Jehu did with deceit his purpose being the destruction of the servants of Baal
Ki  And Jehu said Let there be a special holy meeting for the worship of Baal So a public statement was made
Ki  And Jehu sent out through all Israel and all the servants of Baal came not one kept away And they came into the house of Baal so that it was full from end to end
Ki  And Jehu said to him who kept the robes Get out robes for all the servants of Baal So he got out robes for them
Ki  And Jehu with Jehonadab the son of Rechab went into the house of Baal and he said to the servants of Baal Make a search with care to see that no servant of the Lord is with you but only servants of Baal
Ki  Then they went in to make offerings and burned offerings Now Jehu had put eighty men outside and said to them If any man whom I give into your hands gets away the life of him who lets him go will be the price of his life
Ki  Then when the burned offering was ended straight away Jehu said to the armed men and the captains Go in and put them to death let not one come out So they put them to the sword and pulling the images to the earth they went into the holy place of the house of Baal
Ki  And they took out the image of Asherah from the house of Baal and had it burned
Ki  The altar of Baal was pulled down and the house of Baal was broken up and made an unclean place as it is to this day
Ki  So Jehu put an end to the worship of Baal in Israel
Ki  But Jehu did not keep himself from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and the evil he made Israel do the gold oxen were still in Bethel and in Dan
Ki  And the Lord said to Jehu Because you have done well in doing what is right in my eyes and effecting all my purpose for the family of Ahab your sons will be kings of Israel to the fourth generation
Ki  But Jehu did not take care to keep the law of the Lord with all his heart he did not keep himself from the sin which Jeroboam did and made Israel do
Ki  In those days the Lord was angry first with Israel and Hazael made attacks on all the land of Israel
Ki  East of Jordan in all the land of Gilead the Gadites and the Reubenites and the Manassites from Aroer by the valley of the Arnon all Gilead and Bashan
Ki  Now the rest of the acts of Jehu and all he did and his great power are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel
Ki  And Jehu went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in Samaria And Jehoahaz his son became king in his place
Ki  And the time of Jehus rule over Israel in Samaria was twentyeight years
Ki  Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead she had all the rest of the seed of the kingdom put to death
Ki  But Jehosheba the daughter of King Joram sister of Ahaziah secretly took Joash the son of Ahaziah with the woman who took care of him away from among the kings sons who were put to death and put him in the bedroom and they kept him safe from Athaliah so that he was not put to death
Ki  And for six years she kept him safe in the house of the Lord while Athaliah was ruling over the land
Ki  Then in the seventh year Jehoiada sent for the captains of hundreds of the Carians and the armed men and taking them into the house of the Lord made an agreement with them and made them take an oath in the house of the Lord and let them see the kings son
Ki  And he gave them orders saying This is what you are to do the third part of you who come in on the Sabbath and keep the watch of the kings house
Ki  
Ki  And the two divisions of you who go out on the Sabbath and keep the watch of the house of the Lord
Ki  Will make a circle round the king every man being armed and whoever comes inside your lines is to be put to death keep with the king when he goes out and when he comes in
Ki  And the captains of hundreds did as Jehoiada the priest gave them orders every one took with him his men those who came in and those who went out on the Sabbath and they came in to Jehoiada the priest
Ki  And the priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and bodycovers which had been King Davids and which were kept in the house of the Lord
Ki  Then the armed men took up their positions every man with his instruments of war in his hand from the right side of the house to the left round about the altar and the house
Ki  Then he made the kings son come out and put the crown on him and the armbands and made him king and put the holy oil on him and they all making sounds of joy with their hands said Long life to the king
Ki  Now Athaliah hearing the noise made by the people came to the people in the house of the Lord
Ki  And looking she saw the king in his regular place by the pillar and the captains and the horns near him and all the people of the land giving signs of joy and sounding the horns Then Athaliah violently parting her robes gave a cry saying Broken faith broken faith
Ki  Then Jehoiada the priest gave orders to those who were placed in authority over the army saying Take her outside the lines and let anyone who goes after her be put to death with the sword for he said Let her not be put to death in the house of the Lord
Ki  So they put their hands on her and she went to the kings house by the doorway of the horses and there she was put to death
Ki  And Jehoiada made an agreement between the Lord and the king and the people that they would be the Lords people and in the same way between the king and the people
Ki  Then all the people of the land went to the house of Baal and had it pulled down its altars and images were all broken to bits and Mattan the priest of Baal they put to death before the altars And the priest put overseers over the Lords house
Ki  Then he took the captains of hundreds and the Carians and the armed men and all the people of the land and they came down with the king from the house of the Lord through the doorway of the armed men to the kings house And he took his place on the seat of the kings
Ki  So all the people of the land were glad and the town was quiet and they had put Athaliah to death with the sword at the kings house
Ki  And Jehoash was seven years old when he became king
Ki  In the seventh year of Jehus rule Jehoash became king and he was ruling for forty years in Jerusalem his mothers name was Zibiah of Beersheba
Ki  Jehoash did what was right in the eyes of the Lord all his days because he was guided by the teaching of Jehoiada the priest
Ki  But the high places were not taken away the people went on making offerings and burning them in the high places
Ki  And Jehoash said to the priests All the money of the holy things which comes into the house of the Lord the amount fixed for every mans payment and all the money given by any man freely from the impulse of his heart
Ki  Let the priests take every man from his friends and neighbours to make good what is damaged in the house wherever it is to be seen
Ki  But in the twentythird year of King Jehoash the priests had not made good the damaged parts of the house
Ki  Then King Jehoash sent for Jehoiada the priest and the other priests and said to them Why have you not made good what is damaged in the house now take no more money from your neighbours but give it for the building up of the house
Ki  So the priests made an agreement to take no more money from the people and not to make good what was damaged in the house
Ki  But Jehoiada the priest took a chest and making a hole in the cover of it put it by the altar on the right side when one comes into the house of the Lord and the priests who kept the door put in it regularly all the money which was taken into the house of the Lord
Ki  And when they saw that there was much money in the chest the kings scribe and the high priest came and put it in bags noting the amount of all the money there was in the house of the Lord
Ki  And the money which was measured out they gave regularly to those who were responsible for overseeing the work and these gave it in payment to the woodworkers and the builders who were working on the house of the Lord
Ki  And to the wallbuilders and the stonecutters and to get wood and cut stone for building up the broken parts of the house of the Lord and for everything needed to put the house in good order
Ki  But the money was not used for making silver cups or scissors or basins or windinstruments or any vessels of gold or silver for the house of the Lord
Ki  But it was all given to the workmen who were building up the house
Ki  And they did not get any statement of accounts from the men to whom the money was given for the workmen for they made use of it with good faith
Ki  The money of the offerings for error and the sinofferings was not taken into the house of the Lord it was the priests
Ki  Then Hazael king of Aram went up against Gath and took it and his purpose was to go up to Jerusalem
Ki  Then Jehoash king of Judah took all the holy things which Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah his fathers the kings of Judah had given to the Lord together with the things he himself had given and all the gold in the Temple store and in the kings house and sent it to Hazael king of Aram and he went away from Jerusalem
Ki  Now the rest of the acts of Joash and all he did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel
Ki  And his servants made a secret design and put Joash to death at the house of Millo on the way down to Silla
Ki  And Jozacar the son of Shimeath and Jehozabad the son of Shomer his servants came to him and put him to death and they put him into the earth with his fathers in the town of David and Amaziah his son became king in his place
Ki  In the twentythird year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king of Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu became king over Israel in Samaria ruling for seventeen years
Ki  He did evil in the eyes of the Lord copying the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat which he did and made Israel do he did not keep himself from them
Ki  So the wrath of the Lord was burning against Israel and he gave them up into the power of Hazael king of Aram and into the power of Benhadad the son of Hazael again and again
Ki  Then Jehoahaz made prayer to the Lord and the Lord gave ear to him for he saw how cruelly Israel was crushed by the king of Aram
Ki  And the Lord gave Israel a saviour so that they became free from the hands of the Aramaeans and the children of Israel were living in their tents as in the past
Ki  But still they did not give up the sin of Jeroboam which he made Israel do but went on with it and there was an image of Asherah in Samaria
Ki  For out of all his army Jehoahaz had only fifty horsemen and ten carriages and ten thousand footmen the king of Aram had given them up to destruction crushing them like dust
Ki  Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz and all he did and his great power are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel
Ki  And Jehoahaz went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in Samaria and Joash his son became king in his place
Ki  In the thirtyseventh year of the rule of Joash king of Judah Joash the son of Jehoahaz became king over Israel in Samaria ruling for sixteen years
Ki  He did evil in the eyes of the Lord not turning away from the sin of Jeroboam the son of Nebat which he did and made Israel do but he went on with it
Ki  Now the rest of the acts of Joash and all he did and the force with which he went to war against Amaziah king of Judah are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel
Ki  And Joash went to rest with his fathers and Jeroboam took his place as king and Joash was put into the earth in Samaria with the kings of Israel
Ki  Now Elisha became ill with the disease which was the cause of his death and Joash king of Israel came down to him and weeping over him said My father my father the warcarriages of Israel and its horsemen
Ki  Then Elisha said to him Take bow and arrows and he took bow and arrows
Ki  And he said to the king of Israel Put your hand on the bow and he put his hand on it and Elisha put his hands on the kings hands
Ki  Then he said Let the window be open to the east and he got it open Then Elisha said Let the arrow go and he let it go And he said The Lords arrow of salvation of salvation over Aram for you will overcome the Aramaeans in Aphek and put an end to them
Ki  And he said Take the arrows and he took them And he said to the king of Israel Send them down into the earth and he did so three times and no more
Ki  Then the man of God was angry with him and said If you had done it five or six times then you would have overcome Aram completely but now you will only overcome them three times
Ki  And death came to Elisha and they put his body into the earth Now in the spring of the year armed bands of Moabites frequently came overrunning the land
Ki  And while they were putting a dead man into the earth they saw a band coming and they put the man quickly into the place where Elishas body was and the dead man on touching Elishas bones came to life again and got up on his feet
Ki  And Israel was crushed under the power of Hazael king of Aram all the days of Jehoahaz
Ki  But the Lord was kind to them and had pity on them caring for them because of his agreement with Abraham Isaac and Jacob he would not put them to destruction or send them away from before his face till now
Ki  Then Hazael king of Aram came to his end and Benhadad his son became king in his place
Ki  And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again from Benhadad the son of Hazael the towns which he had taken from Jehoahaz his father in war Three times Jehoash overcame him and got back the towns of Israel
Ki  In the second year of Joash son of Joahaz king of Israel Amaziah the son of Joash became king of Judah
Ki  He was twentyfive years old when he became king and he was ruling in Jerusalem for twentynine years his mothers name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem
Ki  He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord though not like David his father he did as Joash his father had done
Ki  But still the high places were not taken away the people went on making offerings and burning them in the high places
Ki  Now when he became strong in the kingdom straight away he put to death those servants who had taken the life of the king his father
Ki  But he did not put their children to death for the orders of the Lord recorded in the book of the law of Moses say The fathers are not to be put to death for the children or the children for their fathers but a man is to be put to death for the sin which he himself has done
Ki  He put to the sword twelve thousand men of Edom in the Valley of Salt and took Sela in war naming it Joktheel as it is to this day
Ki  Then Amaziah sent representatives to Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu king of Israel saying Come let us have a meeting face to face
Ki  And Jehoash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah saying The thorntree in Lebanon sent to the cedar in Lebanon saying Give your daughter to my son for a wife and a beast from the woodland in Lebanon went by crushing the thorn under his feet
Ki  It is true that you have overcome Edom and your heart is uplifted let that glory be enough for you and keep in your country why do you make causes of trouble putting yourself and Judah with you in danger of downfall
Ki  But Amaziah gave no attention So Jehoash king of Israel went up and he and Amaziah king of Judah came face to face at Bethshemesh which is in Judah
Ki  And Judah was overcome before Israel so that they went in flight every man to his tent
Ki  And Jehoash king of Israel made Amaziah king of Judah the son of Jehoash son of Ahaziah prisoner at Bethshemesh and came to Jerusalem and had the wall of Jerusalem pulled down from the doorway of Ephraim to the door in the angle four hundred cubits
Ki  And he took all the gold and silver and all the vessels which were in the house of the Lord and in the storehouse of the king together with those whose lives would be the price of broken faith and went back to Samaria
Ki  Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash and his power and how he went to war with Amaziah king of Judah are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel
Ki  And Jehoash went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in Samaria with the kings of Israel and Jeroboam his son became king in his place
Ki  Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah went on living for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel
Ki  And the rest of the acts of Amaziah are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah
Ki  Now they made a secret design against him in Jerusalem and he went in flight to Lachish but they sent after him to Lachish and put him to death there
Ki  And they took his body on horseback and put it into the earth with his fathers in Jerusalem the town of David
Ki  Then all the people of Judah took Azariah who was sixteen years old and made him king in place of his father Amaziah
Ki  He was the builder of Elath which he got back for Judah after the death of the king
Ki  In the fifteenth year of the rule of Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel became king in Samaria ruling for fortyone years
Ki  He did evil in the eyes of the Lord not turning away from the sin which Jeroboam the son of Nebat did and made Israel do
Ki  He got back the old limits of Israel from the way into Hamath to the sea of the Arabah as the Lord had said by his servant Jonah the son of Amittai the prophet of Gathhepher
Ki  For the Lord saw how bitter was the trouble of Israel and that everyone was cut off he who was shut up and he who went free and that Israel had no helper
Ki  And the Lord had not said that the name of Israel was to be taken away from the earth but he gave them a saviour in Jeroboam the son of Joash
Ki  Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam and all he did and his power and how he went to war with Damascus causing the wrath of the Lord to be turned away from Israel are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel
Ki  And Jeroboam went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth with the kings of Israel and Zechariah his son became king in his place
Ki  In the twentyseventh year of the rule of Jeroboam king of Israel Azariah son of Amaziah became king of Judah
Ki  He was sixteen years old when he became king and he was ruling in Jerusalem for fiftytwo years his mothers name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem
Ki  And he did what was right in the eyes of the Lord as his father Amaziah had done
Ki  But he did not take away the high places and the people still went on making offerings and burning them in the high places
Ki  And the Lord sent disease on the king and he became a leper and to the day of his death he was living separately in his private house And Jotham his son was over his house judging the people of the land
Ki  Now the rest of the acts of Azariah and all he did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah
Ki  And Azariah went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth with his fathers in the town of David and Jotham his son became king in his place
Ki  In the thirtyeighth year of Azaliah king of Judah Zechariah son of Jeroboam was king over Israel for six months
Ki  And he did evil in the eyes of the Lord as his father had done not turning away from the sin which Jeroboam the son of Nebat did and made Israel do
Ki  And Shallum the son of Jabesh made a secret design against him and attacking him in Ibleam put him to death and became king in his place
Ki  Now the rest of the acts of Zechariah are recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel
Ki  This was what the Lord had said to Jehu Your sons to the fourth generation will be kings of Israel And so it came about
Ki  Shallum the son of Jabesh became king in the thirtyninth year of Uzziah king of Judah and he was ruling in Samaria for the space of one month
Ki  Then Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah and came to Samaria and attacking Shallum son of Jabesh in Samaria put him to death and made himself king in his place
Ki  Now the rest of the acts of Shallum and the secret design which he made are recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel
Ki  Then Menahem sent destruction on Tappuah and all the people in it and its limits from Tirzah because they would not let him come in and he had all the women who were with child cut open
Ki  In the thirtyninth year of Azariah king of Judah Menahem the son of Gadi became king over Israel and was ruling in Samaria for ten years
Ki  He did evil in the eyes of the Lord he did not keep himself from the sin which Jeroboam the son of Nebat did and made Israel do
Ki  In his day Pul the king of Assyria came up against the land and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver so that he might let him keep the kingdom
Ki  And Menahem got the money from Israel from all the men of wealth fifty silver shekels from every man to give to the king of Assyria So the king of Assyria went back without stopping in the land
Ki  Now the rest of the acts of Menahem and all he did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel
Ki  And Menahem went to rest with his fathers and Pekahiah his son became king in his place
Ki  In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son of Menahem became king over Israel in Samaria ruling for two years
Ki  He did evil in the eyes of the Lord not turning from the sin which Jeroboam the son of Nebat did and made Israel do
Ki  And Pekah the son of Remaliah his captain made a secret design against him attacking him in the kings great house in Samaria and with him were fifty men of Gilead and he put him to death and became king in his place

Ki  In the fiftysecond year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son of Remaliah became king over Israel in Samaria ruling for twenty years
Ki  He did evil in the eyes of the Lord not turning from the sin which Jeroboam the son of Nebat did and made Israel do
Ki  In the days of Pekah king of Israel Tiglathpileser king of Assyria came and took Ijon and Abelbethmaacah and Janoah and Kedesh and Hazor and Gilead and Galilee and all the land of Naphtali and he took the people away to Assyria
Ki  And Hoshea the son of Elah made a secret design against Pekah the son of Remaliah and attacking him put him to death and became king in his place in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah
Ki  Now the rest of the acts of Pekah and all he did are recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel
Ki  In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel Jotham the son of Uzziah became king of Judah
Ki  He was twentyfive years old when he became king and he was ruling for sixteen years in Jerusalem and his mothers name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok
Ki  And he did what was right in the eyes of the Lord as his father Uzziah had done
Ki  But he did not take away the high places and the people still went on making offerings and burning them in the high places He was the builder of the higher doorway of the house of the Lord
Ki  Now the rest of the acts of Jotham and all he did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah
Ki  In those days the Lord first sent against Judah Rezin the king of Aram and Pekah the son of Remaliah
Ki  And Jotham went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in the town of David his father and Ahaz his son became king in his place
Ki  In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham became king of Judah
Ki  Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king he was ruling for sixteen years in Jerusalem He did not do what was right in the eyes of the Lord his God as David his father did
Ki  But he went in the ways of the kings of Israel and even made his son go through the fire copying the disgusting ways of the nations whom the Lord had sent out of the land before the children of Israel
Ki  And he made offerings burning them in the high places and on the hills and under every green tree
Ki  Then Rezin king of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to make war and they made an attack on Ahaz shutting him in but were not able to overcome him
Ki  At that time the king of Edom got Elath back for Edom and sent the Jews out of Elath and the Edomites came back to Elath where they are living to this day
Ki  So Ahaz sent representatives to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria saying I am your servant and your son come to my help against the kings of Aram and Israel who have taken up arms against me
Ki  And Ahaz took the silver and gold which were in the house of the Lord and in the kings storehouse and sent them as an offering to the king of Assyria
Ki  And the king of Assyria in answer to his request went up against Damascus and took it and took its people away as prisoners to Kir and put Rezin to death
Ki  Then King Ahaz went to Damascus for a meeting with Tiglathpileser king of Assyria and there he saw the altar which was at Damascus and King Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest a copy of the altar giving the design of it and all the details of its structure
Ki  And from the copy King Ahaz sent from Damascus Urijah made an altar and had it ready by the time King Ahaz came back from Damascus
Ki  And when the king came from Damascus he saw the altar and he went up on it and made an offering on it
Ki  He made his burned offering and his meal offering and his drink offering there draining out the blood of his peaceofferings on the altar
Ki  And the brass altar which was before the Lord he took from the front of the house from between his altar and the house of the Lord and put it on the north side of his altar
Ki  And King Ahaz gave orders to Urijah the priest saying Make the morning burned offering and the evening meal offering and the kings burned offering and meal offering with the burned offerings of all the people and their meal offerings and drink offerings on the great altar and put on it all the blood of the burned offerings and of the beasts which are offered but the brass altar will be for my use to get directions from the Lord
Ki  So Urijah the priest did everything as the king said
Ki  And King Ahaz took off the sides of the wheeled bases and took down the great watervessel from off the brass oxen which were under it and put it on a floor of stone
Ki   the house of the Lord because of the king of Assyria
Ki  Now the rest of the things which Ahaz did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah
Ki  And Ahaz went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth with his fathers in the town of David and Hezekiah his son became king in his place
Ki  In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah Hoshea the son of Elah became king over Israel in Samaria ruling for nine years
Ki  He did evil in the eyes of the Lord though not like the kings of Israel before him
Ki  Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria and Hoshea became his servant and sent him offerings
Ki  But Hosheas broken faith became clear to the king of Assyria because he had sent representatives to So king of Egypt and did not send his offering to the king of Assyria as he had done year by year so the king of Assyria had him shut up in prison and put in chains
Ki  Then the king of Assyria went through all the land and came up to Samaria shutting it in with his forces for three years
Ki  In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria and took Israel away to Assyria placing them in Halah and in Habor on the river Gozan and in the towns of the Medes
Ki  And the wrath of the Lord came on Israel because they had done evil against the Lord their God who took them out of the land of Egypt from under the yoke of Pharaoh king of Egypt and had become worshippers of other gods
Ki  Living by the rules of the nations whom the Lord had sent out from before the children of Israel
Ki  And the children of Israel did secretly against the Lord their God things which were not right building high places for themselves in all their towns from the tower of the watchmen to the walled town
Ki  They put up pillars of stone and wood on every high hill and under every green tree
Ki  Burning their offerings in all the high places as those nations did whom the Lord sent away from before them they did evil things moving the Lord to wrath
Ki  And they made themselves servants of disgusting things though the Lord had said You are not to do this
Ki  And he gave witness to Israel and Judah by every prophet and seer saying Come back from your evil ways and do my orders and keep my rules and be guided by the law which I gave to your fathers and sent to you by my servants the prophets
Ki  And they did not give ear but became stiffnecked like their fathers who had no faith in the Lord their God
Ki  And they went against his rules and the agreement which he made with their fathers and his laws which he gave them they gave themselves up to things without sense or value and became foolish like the nations round them of whom the Lord had said Do not as they do
Ki  And turning their backs on all the orders which the Lord had given them they made for themselves images of metal and the image of Asherah worshipping all the stars of heaven and becoming servants to Baal
Ki  And they made their sons and their daughters go through the fire and they made use of secret arts and unnatural powers and gave themselves up to doing evil in the eyes of the Lord till he was moved to wrath
Ki  So the Lord was very angry with Israel and his face was turned away from them only the tribe of Judah kept its place
Ki  But even Judah did not keep the orders of the Lord their God but were guided by the rules which Israel had made
Ki  So the Lord would have nothing to do with all the offspring of Israel and sent trouble on them and gave them up into the hands of their attackers till he had sent them away from before his face
Ki  For Israel was broken off from the family of David and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king who driving them away from the laws of the Lord made them do a great sin
Ki  And the children of Israel went on with all the sins which Jeroboam did they did not keep themselves from them
Ki  Till the Lord put Israel away from before his face as he had said by all his servants the prophets So Israel was taken away from their land to Assyria to this day
Ki  Then the king of Assyria took men from Babylon and from Cuthah and Avva and Hamath and Sepharvaim and put them in the towns of Samaria in place of the children of Israel so they got Samaria for their heritage living in its towns
Ki  Now when first they were living there they did not give worship to the Lord So the Lord sent lions among them causing the death of some of them
Ki  So they said to the king of Assyria The nations whom you have taken as prisoners and put in the towns of Samaria have no knowledge of the way of the god of the land so he has sent lions among them causing their death because they have no knowledge of his way
Ki  Then the king of Assyria gave orders saying Send there one of the priests whom you took away and let him be living there and teaching the people the way of the god of the land
Ki  So one of the priests whom they had taken away as a prisoner from Samaria came back and living in Bethel became their teacher in the worship of the Lord
Ki  And every nation made gods for themselves and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made every nation in the towns where they were living
Ki  The men of Babylon made Succothbenoth and the men of Cuth made Nergal and the men of Hamath made Ashima
Ki  The Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak and the Sepharvites gave their children to be burned in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech the gods of Sepharvaim
Ki  So they went on worshipping the Lord and made for themselves from among all the people priests for the high places to make offerings for them in the houses of the high places
Ki  They gave worship to the Lord but they gave honour to their gods like the nations did from whom they had been taken as prisoners
Ki  So to this day they go on in their old ways not worshipping the Lord or keeping his orders or his ways or the law and the rule which the Lord gave to the children of Jacob to whom he gave the name Israel
Ki  And the Lord made an agreement with them and gave them orders saying You are to have no other gods you are not to give worship to them or be their servants or make them offerings
Ki  But the Lord who took you out of the land of Egypt with his great power and his outstretched arm he is your God to whom you are to give worship and make offerings
Ki  And the rules and the orders and the law which he put in writing for you you are to keep and do for ever you are to have no other gods
Ki  And you are to keep in memory the agreement which I have made with you and you are to have no other gods
Ki  And you are to give worship to the Lord your God for it is he who will give you salvation from the hands of all who are against you
Ki  But they gave no attention but went on in their old way
Ki  So these nations worshipping the Lord still were servants to the images they had made their children and their childrens children did the same as their fathers did so do they to this day
Ki  Now in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel Hezekiah the son of Ahaz became king of Judah
Ki  He was twentyfive years old when he became king ruling in Jerusalem for twentynine years his mothers name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah
Ki  He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord as David his father had done
Ki  He had the high places taken away and the stone pillars broken to bits and the Asherah cut down and the brass snake which Moses had made was crushed to powder at his order because in those days the children of Israel had offerings burned before it and he gave it the name Nehushtan
Ki  He had faith in the Lord the God of Israel so that there was no one like him among all the kings of Judah who were before him
Ki  For his heart was fixed on the Lord not turning from his ways and he did his orders which the Lord gave to Moses
Ki  And the Lord was with him he did well in all his undertakings and he took up arms against the king of Assyria and was his servant no longer
Ki  He overcame the Philistines as far as Gaza and its limits from the tower of the watchman to the walled town
Ki  Now in the fourth year of King Hezekiah which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria shutting it in with his armies
Ki  And at the end of three years they took it in the sixth year of Hezekiahs rule which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel Samaria was taken
Ki  And the king of Assyria took Israel away as prisoners into Assyria placing them in Halah and in Habor on the river Gozan and in the towns of the Medes
Ki  Because they did not give ear to the voice of the Lord their God but went against his agreement even against everything ordered by Moses the servant of the Lord and they did not give ear to it or do it
Ki  Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the walled towns of Judah and took them
Ki  And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to Lachish to the king of Assyria saying I have done wrong give up attacking me and whatever you put on me I will undergo And the payment he was to make was fixed by the king of Assyria at three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold
Ki  So Hezekiah gave him all the silver in the house of the Lord and in the kings storehouse
Ki  And at that time Hezekiah had the gold from the doors of the Lords house and from the doorpillars plated by him cut off and gave it to the king of Assyria
Ki  Then the king of Assyria sent the Tartan and the Rabsaris and the Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah with a strong force And they went up and came to Jerusalem and took up their position by the stream of the higher pool by the highway of the washermans field
Ki  And they sent for the king and Eliakim the son of Hilkiah who was over the house and Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder came out to them
Ki  And the Rabshakeh said to them Say now to Hezekiah These are the words of the great king the king of Assyria In what are you placing your hope
Ki  You say you have a design and strength for war but these are only words Now to whom are you looking for support that you have gone against my authority
Ki  See now you are basing your hope on that broken rod of Egypt which will go through a mans hand if he makes use of it for a support for so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who put their faith in him
Ki  And if you say to me Our hope is in the Lord our God is it not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah has taken away saying to Judah and Jerusalem that worship may only be given before this altar in Jerusalem
Ki  And now take a chance with my master the king of Assyria and I will give you two thousand horses if you are able to put horsemen on them
Ki  How then may you put to shame the least of my masters servants and you have put your hope in Egypt for warcarriages and horsemen
Ki  And have I now come up to send destruction on this place without the Lords authority It was the Lord himself who said to me Go up against this land and make it waste
Ki  Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah and Shebna and Joah said to the Rabshakeh Will you kindly make use of the Aramaean language in talking to your servants for we are used to it and do not make use of the Jews language in the hearing of the people on the wall
Ki  But the Rabshakeh said to them Is it to your master or to you that my master has sent me to say these words has he not sent me to the men seated on the wall for they are the people who will be short of food with you when the town is shut in
Ki  Then the Rabshakeh got up and said with a loud voice in the Jews language Give ear to the words of the great king the king of Assyria
Ki  This is what the king says Do not be tricked by Hezekiah for there is no salvation for you in him
Ki  And do not let Hezekiah make you put your faith in the Lord saying The Lord will certainly keep us safe and this town will not be given into the hands of the king of Assyria
Ki  Do not give ear to Hezekiah for this is what the king of Assyria says Make peace with me and come out to me and everyone will be free to take the fruit of his vine and of his figtree and the water of his spring
Ki  Till I come and take you away to a land like yours a land of grain and wine a land of bread and vinegardens a land of oilgiving olives and of honey so that life and not death may be your fate Give no attention to Hezekiah when he says to you The Lord will keep us safe
Ki  Has any one of the gods of the nations kept his land from falling into the hands of the king of Assyria
Ki  Where are the gods of Hamath and of Arpad where are the gods of Sepharvaim of Hena and Ivvah have they kept Samaria out of my hands
Ki  Who among all the gods of these countries have kept their country from falling into my hands to give cause for the thought that the Lord will keep Jerusalem from falling into my hands
Ki  But the people kept quiet and gave him no answer for the kings order was Give him no answer
Ki  Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah who was over the house and Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder came to Hezekiah with their clothing parted as a sign of grief and gave him an account of what the Rabshakeh had said
Ki  And on hearing it King Hezekiah took off his robe and put on haircloth and went into the house of the Lord
Ki  And he sent Eliakim who was over the house and Shebna the scribe and the chief priests dressed in haircloth to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz
Ki  And they said to him Hezekiah says This day is a day of trouble and punishment and shame for the children are ready to come to birth but there is no strength to give birth to them
Ki  It may be that the Lord your God will give ear to the words of the Rabshakeh whom the king of Assyria his master sent to say evil things against the living God and will make his words come to nothing so then make your prayer for the rest of the people
Ki  So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah
Ki  And Isaiah said to them This is what you are to say to your master The Lord says Be not troubled by the words which the servants of the king of Assyria have said against me in your hearing
Ki  See I will put a spirit into him and bad news will come to his ears and he will go back to his land and there I will have him put to death by the sword
Ki  So the Rabshakeh went back and when he got there the king of Assyria was making war against Libnah for it had come to his ears that he had gone away from Lachish
Ki  And when news came to him that Tirhakah king of Ethiopia had made an attack on him he sent representatives to Hezekiah again saying
Ki  This is what you are to say to Hezekiah king of Judah Let not your God in whom is your faith give you a false hope saying Jerusalem will not be given into the hands of the king of Assyria
Ki  No doubt the story has come to your ears of what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands putting them to the curse and will you be kept safe
Ki  Did the gods of the nations keep safe those on whom my fathers sent destruction Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the children of Eden who were in Telassar
Ki  Where is the king of Hamath and the king of Arpad and the king of the town of Sepharvaim of Hena and of Ivvah
Ki  And Hezekiah took the letter from the hands of those who had come with it and after reading it Hezekiah went up to the house of the Lord opening the letter there before the Lord
Ki  And Hezekiah made his prayer to the Lord saying O Lord the God of Israel seated between the winged ones you only are the God of all the kingdoms of the earth you have made heaven and earth
Ki  Let your ear be turned to us O Lord and let your eyes be open O Lord and see take note of all the words of Sennacherib who has sent men to say evil against the living God
Ki  Truly O Lord the kings of Assyria have made waste the nations and their lands
Ki  And have given their gods to the fire for they were no gods but wood and stone the work of mens hands so they have given them to destruction
Ki  But now O Lord our God give us salvation from his hands so that it may be clear to all the kingdoms of the earth that you and only you O Lord are God
Ki  Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah saying The Lord the God of Israel says The prayer which you have made to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria has come to my ears
Ki  This is the word which the Lord has said about him In the eyes of the virgin daughter of Zion you are shamed and laughed at the daughter of Jerusalem has made sport of you
Ki  Against whom have you said evil and bitter things against whom has your voice been loud and your eyes lifted up even against the Holy One of Israel
Ki  You have sent your servants with evil words against the Lord and have said With all my warcarriages I have come up to the top of the mountains to the inmost parts of Lebanon its tall cedars will be cut down and the best trees of its woods I will come up into his highest places into his thick woods
Ki  I have made waterholes and taken their waters and with my foot I have made all the rivers of Egypt dry
Ki  Has it not come to your ears how I did it long before purposing it in times long past Now I have given effect to my design so that by you strong towns might be turned into masses of broken walls
Ki  This is why their townsmen had no power they were broken and put to shame they were like the grass of the field and the green plant like grass on the housetops
Ki  But I have knowledge of your getting up and your resting of your going out and your coming in
Ki  Because your wrath against me and your words of pride have come up to my ears I will put my hook in your nose and my cord in your lips and I will make you go back by the way you came
Ki  And this will be the sign to you you will get your food this year from what comes up of itself and in the second year from the produce of the same and in the third year you will put in your seed and get in the grain and make vinegardens and take of their fruit
Ki  And those of Judah who are still living will again take root in the earth and give fruit
Ki  For from Jerusalem those who have been kept safe will go out and those who are still living will go out of Mount Zion by the fixed purpose of the Lord of armies this will be done
Ki  For this cause the Lord says about the king of Assyria He will not come into this town or send an arrow against it he will not come before it with arms or put up an earthwork against it
Ki  By the way he came he will go back and he will not get into this town says the Lord
Ki  For I will keep this town safe for my honour and for the honour of my servant David
Ki  And that night the angel of the Lord went out and put to death in the army of the Assyrians a hundred and eightyfive thousand men and when the people got up early in the morning there was nothing to be seen but dead bodies
Ki  So Sennacherib king of Assyria went back to his place at Nineveh
Ki  And it came about when he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god that his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer put him to death with the sword and they went in flight into the land of Ararat And Esarhaddon his son became king in his place
Ki  In those days Hezekiah was ill and near death And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him and said to him The Lord says Put your house in order for your death is near
Ki  Then turning his face to the wall he made his prayer to the Lord saying
Ki  O Lord keep in mind how I have been true to you with all my heart and have done what is good in your eyes And Hezekiah gave way to bitter weeping
Ki  Now before Isaiah had gone out of the middle of the town the word of the Lord came to him saying
Ki  Go back and say to Hezekiah the ruler of my people The Lord the God of David your father says Your prayer has come to my ears and I have seen your weeping see I will make you well on the third day you will go up to the house of the Lord
Ki  I will give you fifteen more years of life and I will keep you and this town safe from the hands of the king of Assyria I will keep this town safe for my honour and for the honour of my servant David
Ki  Then Isaiah said Take a cake of figs So they took it and put it on his wound and he got better
Ki  And Hezekiah said to Isaiah What is to be the sign that the Lord will make me well and that I will go up to the house of the Lord on the third day
Ki  And Isaiah said This is the sign the Lord will give you that he will do what he has said will the shade go forward ten degrees or back
Ki  And Hezekiah said in answer It is a simple thing for the shade to go forward but let it go back ten degrees
Ki  Then Isaiah the prophet made prayer to the Lord and he made the shade go back ten degrees from its position on the steps of Ahaz
Ki  At that time Merodachbaladan the son of Baladan king of Babylon sent letters with an offering to Hezekiah because he had news that Hezekiah had been ill
Ki  And Hezekiah was glad at their coming and let them see all his store of wealth the silver and the gold and the spices and the oil of great price and the house of his arms and everything there was in his stores there was nothing in all his house or his kingdom which Hezekiah did not let them see
Ki  Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said to him What did these men say and where did they come from And Hezekiah said They came from a far country even from Babylon
Ki  And he said What have they seen in your house And Hezekiah said in answer They saw everything in my house there is nothing among my stores which I did not let them see
Ki  And Isaiah said to Hezekiah Give ear to the word of the Lord
Ki  Truly days are coming when everything in your house and whatever your fathers have put in store till this day will be taken away to Babylon all will be gone says the Lord
Ki  And your sons the offspring of your body they will take away to be unsexed servants in the house of the king of Babylon
Ki  Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah Good is the word of the Lord which you have said Then he said  if in my time there is peace and righteousness
Ki  Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his power and how he made the pool and the stream to take water into the town are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah
Ki  And Hezekiah went to rest with his fathers and Manasseh his son became king in his place
Ki  Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king for fiftyfive years he was ruling in Jerusalem and his mothers name was Hephzibah
Ki  He did evil in the eyes of the Lord copying the disgusting ways of those nations whom the Lord had sent out before the children of Israel
Ki  He put up again the high places which had been pulled down by Hezekiah his father he made altars for Baal and an Asherah as Ahab king of Israel had done he was a worshipper and servant of all the stars of heaven
Ki  And he put up altars in the house of the Lord of which the Lord had said In Jerusalem will I put my name
Ki  And he put up altars for all the stars of heaven in the two outer squares of the house of the Lord
Ki  And he made his son go through the fire and made use of secret arts and signs for reading the future he gave positions to those who had control of spirits and to wonderworkers he did much evil in the eyes of the Lord moving him to wrath
Ki  He put the image of Asherah which he had made in the house of which the Lord had said to David and to Solomon his son In this house and in Jerusalem the town which I have made mine out of all the tribes of Israel I will put my name for ever
Ki  And never again will I send the feet of Israel wandering from the land which I gave to their fathers if only they will take care to do all my orders and keep all the law which my servant Moses gave them
Ki  But they did not give ear and Manasseh made them do more evil than those nations did whom the Lord gave up to destruction before the children of Israel
Ki  And the Lord said by his servants the prophets
Ki  Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these disgusting things doing more evil than all the Amorites before him and making Judah do evil with his false gods
Ki  For this cause says the Lord the God of Israel I will send such evil on Jerusalem and Judah that the ears of all to whom the news comes will be burning
Ki  And over Jerusalem will be stretched the line of Samaria and the weight of Ahab Jerusalem will be washed clean as a plate is washed and turned over on its face
Ki  And I will put away from me the rest of my heritage and give them up into the hands of their haters who will take their property and their goods for themselves
Ki  Because they have done evil in my eyes moving me to wrath from the day when their fathers came out of Egypt till this day
Ki  More than this Manasseh took the lives of upright men till Jerusalem from one end to the other was full of blood in addition to his sin in making Judah do evil in the eyes of the Lord
Ki  Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh and all he did and his sins are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah
Ki  So Manasseh went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in the garden of his house in the garden of Uzza and Amon his son became king in his place
Ki  Amon was twentytwo years old when he became king ruling in Jerusalem for two years his mothers name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah
Ki  He did evil in the eyes of the Lord as Manasseh his father had done
Ki  He went in all the ways of his father being a servant and worshipper of the false gods to which his father had been a servant
Ki  Turning away from the Lord the God of his fathers and not walking in his ways
Ki  And the servants of Amon made a secret design against him and put the king to death in his house
Ki  But the people of the land put to death all those who had taken part in the design against the king and made Josiah his son king in his place
Ki  Now the rest of the acts which Amon did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah
Ki  He was put in his last restingplace in the garden of Uzza and Josiah his son became king in his place
Ki  Josiah was eight years old when he became king and he was ruling in Jerusalem for thirtyone years his mothers name was Jedidah daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath
Ki  He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord walking in the ways of David his father without turning to the right hand or to the left
Ki  Now in the eighteenth year after he became king Josiah sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam the scribe to the house of the Lord saying to him
Ki  Go up to Hilkiah the chief priest and let him give out the money which is taken into the house of the Lord which the keepers of the door have got together from the people
Ki  And let it be given to the overseers of the work of the Lords house to give to the workmen who are making good what was damaged in the house of the Lord
Ki  To the woodworkers and the builders and the stonecutters and for getting wood and cut stones for the building up of the house
Ki  They did not have to give any account of the money which was handed to them for they made use of it with good faith
Ki  Then Hilkiah the chief priest said to Shaphan the scribe I have made discovery of the book of the law in the house of the Lord So Hilkiah gave it to Shaphan
Ki  Then after reading it Shaphan the scribe went in to the king and gave him an account of what had been done saying Your servants have given out the money which was in the house and have given it to the overseers of the work of the house of the Lord
Ki  Then Shaphan the scribe said to the king Hilkiah the priest has given me a book and he was reading it before the king
Ki  And the king hearing the words of the book of the law took his robe in his hands violently parting it as a sign of his grief
Ki  And he gave orders to Hilkiah the priest and Ahikam the son of Shaphan and Achbor the son of Micaiah and Shaphan the scribe and Asaiah the kings servant saying
Ki  Go and get directions from the Lord for me and for the people and for all Judah about the words of this book which has come to light for great is the wrath of the Lord which is burning against us because our fathers have not given ear to the words of this book to do all the things which are recorded in it
Ki  So Hilkiah the priest and Ahikam and Achbor and Shaphan and Asaiah went to Huldah the woman prophet the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah the son of Harhas keeper of the robes now she was living in Jerusalem in the second part of the town and they had talk with her
Ki  And she said to them The Lord the God of Israel says Say to the man who sent you to me
Ki  These are the words of the Lord See I will send evil on this place and on its people even everything which the king of Judah has been reading in the book
Ki  Because they have given me up burning offerings to other gods and moving me to wrath by all the work of their hands so my wrath will be on fire against this place and will not be put out
Ki  But to the king of Judah who sent you to get directions from the Lord say This is what the Lord the God of Israel has said As to the words which have come to your ears
Ki  Because your heart was soft and you made yourself low before me when you had word of what I said against this place and its people that they would become a waste and a curse and you gave signs of grief weeping before me truly I have given ear to you says the Lord
Ki  For this cause I will let you go to your fathers and be put in your last restingplace in peace and your eyes will not see all the evil which I will send on this place So they took this news back to the king
Ki  Then the king sent and got together all the responsible men of Judah and of Jerusalem
Ki  And the king went up to the house of the Lord with all the men of Judah and all the people of Jerusalem and the priests and the prophets and all the people small and great and they were present at his reading of the book of the law which had come to light in the house of the Lord
Ki  And the king took his place by the pillar and made an agreement before the Lord to go in the way of the Lord and keep his orders and his decisions and his rules with all his heart and all his soul and to keep the words of the agreement recorded in the book and all the people gave their word to keep the agreement
Ki  Then the king gave orders to Hilkiah the chief priest and to the priests of the second order and to the keepers of the door to take out of the house of the Lord all the vessels made for Baal and for the Asherah and for all the stars of heaven and he had them burned outside Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron and took the dust of them to Bethel
Ki  And he put an end to the false priests who had been put in their positions by the kings of Judah to see to the burning of offerings in the high places in the towns of Judah and the outskirts of Jerusalem and all those who made offerings to Baal and to the sun and the moon and the twelve signs and all the stars of heaven
Ki  And he took the Asherah from the house of the Lord outside Jerusalem to the stream Kidron burning it by the stream and crushing it to dust and he put the dust on the place where the bodies of the common people were put to rest
Ki  And he had the houses pulled down of those who were used for sex purposes in the house of the Lord where women were making robes for the Asherah
Ki  And he made all the priests from the towns of Judah come into Jerusalem and he made unclean the high places where the priests had been burning offerings from Geba to Beersheba and he had the high places of the evil spirits pulled down which were by the doorway of Joshua the ruler of the town on the left side of the way into the town
Ki  Still the priests of the high places never came up to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem but they took their food of unleavened bread among their brothers
Ki  And Topheth in the valley of the sons of Hinnom he made unclean so that no man might make his son or his daughter go through the fire to Molech
Ki  And he took away the horses which the kings of Judah had given to the sun at the way into the house of the Lord by the room of Nathanmelech the unsexed servant which was in the outer part of the building and the carriages of the sun he put on fire
Ki  And the altars on the roof of the high room of Ahaz which the kings of Judah had made and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two outer squares of the house of the Lord were pulled down and crushed to bits and the dust of them was put into the stream Kidron
Ki  And the high places before Jerusalem on the south side of the mountain of destruction which Solomon king of Israel had made for Ashtoreth the disgusting god of the Zidonians and for Chemosh the disgusting god of Moab and for Milcom the disgusting god of the children of Ammon the king made unclean
Ki  The stone pillars were broken to bits and the wood pillars cut down and the places where they had been were made full of the bones of the dead
Ki  And the altar at Bethel and the high place put up by Jeroboam the son of Nebat who made Israel do evil that altar and that high place were pulled down and the high place was burned and crushed to dust and the Asherah was burned
Ki  Then Josiah turning round saw on the mountain the places of the dead and he sent and had the bones taken out of their places and burned on the altar so making it unclean as the Lord had said by the man of God when Jeroboam was in his place by the altar on that feastday And he turning his eyes to the restingplace of the man of God who had given word of these things said
Ki  What is that headstone I see over there And the men of the town said to him It is the restingplace of the man of God who came from Judah and gave word of all these things which you have done to the altar of Bethel
Ki  So he said Let him be let not his bones be moved So they let his bones be with the bones of the prophet who came from Samaria
Ki  Then Josiah took away all the houses of the high places in the towns of Samaria which the kings of Israel had put up moving the Lord to wrath and he did with them as he had done in Bethel
Ki  And all the priests of the high places there he put to death on the altars burning the bones of the dead on them and then he went back to Jerusalem
Ki  And the king gave orders to all the people saying Keep the Passover to the Lord your God as it says in this book of the law
Ki  Truly such a Passover had not been kept in all the days of the judges of Israel or of the kings of Israel or the kings of Judah
Ki  In the eighteenth year of the rule of King Josiah this Passover was kept to the Lord in Jerusalem
Ki  And all those who had control of spirits and the wonderworkers and the images and the false gods and all the disgusting things which were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem Josiah put away so that he might give effect to the words of the agreement recorded in the book which Hilkiah the priest made discovery of in the house of the Lord
Ki  Never before had there been a king like him turning to the Lord with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his power as the law of Moses says and after him there was no king like him
Ki  But still the heat of the Lords wrath was not turned back from Judah because of all Manasseh had done in moving him to wrath
Ki  And the Lord said I will send Judah away from before my face as I have sent Israel I will have nothing more to do with this town which I had made mine even Jerusalem and the holy house of which I said My name will be there
Ki  Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and all he did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah
Ki  In his days Pharaohnecoh king of Egypt sent his armies against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates and King Josiah went out against him and he put him to death at Megiddo when he had seen him
Ki  And his servants took his body in a carriage from Megiddo to Jerusalem and put him into the earth there And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah and put the holy oil on him and made him king in place of his father
Ki  Jehoahaz was twentythree years old when he became king ruling in Jerusalem for three months his mothers name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah
Ki  He did evil in the eyes of the Lord as his fathers had done
Ki  And Pharaohnecoh put him in chains at Riblah in the land of Hamath so that he might not be king in Jerusalem and took from the land a tax of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold
Ki  Then Pharaohnecoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in place of Josiah his father changing his name to Jehoiakim but Jehoahaz he took away to Egypt where he was till his death
Ki  And Jehoiakim gave the silver and gold to Pharaoh taxing the land by his orders to get the money the people of the land had to give silver and gold everyone as he was taxed to make the payment to Pharaohnecoh
Ki  Jehoiakim was twentyfive years old when he became king he was ruling in Jerusalem for eleven years his mothers name was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah
Ki  He did evil in the eyes of the Lord as his fathers had done
Ki  In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up and Jehoiakim was his servant for three years then he took up arms against him
Ki  And the Lord sent against him bands of the Chaldaeans and of the Edomites and of the Moabites and of the children of Ammon sending them against Judah for its destruction as he had said by his servants the prophets
Ki  Only by the word of the Lord did this fate come on Judah to take them away from before his face because of the sins of Manasseh and all the evil he did
Ki  And because of the death of those who had done no wrong for he made Jerusalem full of the blood of the upright and the Lord had no forgiveness for it
Ki  Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim and all he did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah
Ki  So Jehoiakim went to rest with his fathers and Jehoiachin his son became king in his place
Ki  And the king of Egypt did not come out of his land again for the king of Babylon had taken all his country from the stream of Egypt to the river Euphrates
Ki  Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king he was ruling in Jerusalem for three months and his mothers name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem
Ki  He did evil in the eyes of the Lord as his father had done
Ki  At that time the armies of Nebuchadnezzar came up to Jerusalem and the town was shut in on every side
Ki  And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came there while his servants were shutting in the town
Ki  Then Jehoiachin king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon with his mother and his servants and his chiefs and his unsexed servants and in the eighth year of his rule the king of Babylon took him
Ki  And he took away all the stored wealth of the Lords house and the goods from the kings storehouse cutting up all the gold vessels which Solomon king of Israel had made in the house of the Lord as the Lord had said
Ki  And he took away all the people of Jerusalem and all the chiefs and all the men of war ten thousand prisoners and all the expert workmen and the metalworkers only the poorest sort of the people of the land were not taken away
Ki  He took Jehoiachin a prisoner to Babylon with his mother and his wives and his unsexed servants and the great men of the land he took them all as prisoners from Jerusalem to Babylon
Ki  And all the men of war seven thousand of them and a thousand expert workmen and metalworkers all of them strong and able to take up arms the king of Babylon took away as prisoners into Babylon
Ki  And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his fathers brother king in place of Jehoiachin changing his name to Zedekiah
Ki  Zedekiah was twentyone years old when he became king and he was king in Jerusalem for eleven years his mothers name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah
Ki  He did evil in the eyes of the Lord as Jehoiakim had done
Ki  And because of the wrath of the Lord this came about in Jerusalem and Judah till he had sent them all away from before him and Zedekiah took up arms against the king of Babylon
Ki  Now in the ninth year of his rule on the tenth day of the tenth month Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against Jerusalem with all his army and took up his position before it building earthworks all round the town
Ki  And the town was shut in by their forces till the eleventh year of King Zedekiah
Ki  Now on the ninth day of the fourth month the store of food in the town was almost gone so that there was no food for the people of the land
Ki  So an opening was made in the wall of the town and all the men of war went in flight by night through the doorway between the two walls which was by the kings garden now the Chaldaeans were stationed round the town and the king went by the way of the Arabah
Ki  But the Chaldaean army went after the king and overtook him in the lowlands of Jericho and all his army went in flight from him in every direction
Ki  And they made the king a prisoner and took him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah to be judged
Ki  And they put the sons of Zedekiah to death before his eyes and then they put out his eyes and chaining him with iron bands took him to Babylon
Ki  Now in the fifth month on the seventh day of the month in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon Nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men a servant of the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem
Ki  And he had the house of the Lord and the kings house and all the houses of Jerusalem even every great house burned with fire
Ki  And the walls round Jerusalem were broken down by the Chaldaean army which was with the captain
Ki  And the rest of the people who were still in the town and all those who had given themselves up to the king of Babylon and all the rest of the workmen Nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men took away as prisoners
Ki  But he let the poorest of the land go on living there to take care of the vines and the fields
Ki  And the brass pillars in the house of the Lord and the wheeled bases and the great brass watervessel in the house of the Lord were broken up by the Chaldaeans who took the brass to Babylon
Ki  And the pots and the spades and the scissors for the lights and the spoons and all the brass vessels used in the Lords house they took away
Ki  And the firetrays and the basins the gold of the gold vessels and the silver of the silver vessels were all taken away by the captain of the armed men
Ki  The two pillars the great watervessel and the wheeled bases which Solomon had made for the house of the Lord the brass of all these vessels was without weight
Ki  One of the pillars was eighteen cubits high with a crown of brass on it the crown was three cubits high circled with a network and apples all of brass and the second pillar had the same
Ki  And the captain of the armed men took Seraiah the chief priest and Zephaniah the second priest and the three doorkeepers
Ki  And from the town he took the unsexed servant who was over the men of war and five of the kings near friends who were in the town and the scribe of the captain of the army who was responsible for getting the people of the land together in military order and sixty men of the people of the land who were in the town
Ki  These Nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men took with him to the king of Babylon at Riblah
Ki  And the king of Babylon put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath So Judah was taken away prisoner from his land
Ki  As for the people who were still living in the land of Judah whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take away he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan ruler over them
Ki  Now the captains of the armed forces hearing that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah ruler came with their men to Gedaliah at Mizpah Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and Johanan the son of Kareah and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite came with all their men
Ki  Then Gedaliah gave his oath to them and their men saying Have no fear because of the servants of the Chaldaeans go on living in the land under the rule of the king of Babylon and all will be well
Ki  But in the seventh month Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama of the kings seed came with ten men and made an attack on Gedaliah causing his death and the death of the Jews and the Chaldaeans who were with him at Mizpah
Ki  Then all the people small and great and the captains of the forces got up and went away to Egypt for fear of the Chaldaeans
Ki  And in the thirtyseventh year after Jehoiachin king of Judah had been taken prisoner in the twelfth month on the twentyseventh day of the month Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the first year of his rule took Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison
Ki  And said kind words to him and put his seat higher than the seats of the other kings who were with him in Babylon
Ki  And his prison clothing was changed and he was a guest at the kings table every day for the rest of his life
Ki  And for his food the king gave him a regular amount every day for the rest of his life

Ch  Now the Philistines were fighting against Israel and the men of Israel went in flight before the Philistines falling down wounded in Mount Gilboa
Ch  And the Philistines went hard after Saul and his sons and put to death Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchishua the sons of Saul
Ch  And the fight was going against Saul and the archers came across him and he was wounded by the archers
Ch  Then Saul said to the servant who had the care of his arms Take your sword and put it through me before these men without circumcision come and make sport of me But his servant full of fear would not do so Then Saul took out his sword falling on it himself
Ch  And when his servant saw that Saul was dead he did the same and came to his death
Ch  So death overtook Saul and his three sons all his family came to an end together
Ch  And when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that the men of Israel had gone in flight and that Saul and his sons were dead they went in flight away from their towns and the Philistines came and took them for themselves
Ch  Now the day after when the Philistines came to take their goods from the dead they saw Saul and his sons dead in Mount Gilboa
Ch  And they took everything off him and took his head and his wardress and sent word into the land of the Philistines round about to give the news to their gods and to the people
Ch  And they put his wardress in the house of their gods and put up his head in the house of Dagon

Ch  All the fightingmen came up and took away Sauls body and the bodies of his sons and took them to Jabesh and put their bones to rest under the oaktree in Jabesh and took no food for seven days

Ch  And not to the Lord for this reason he put him to death and gave the kingdom to David the son of Jesse
Ch  Then all Israel came together to David at Hebron and said Truly we are your bone and your flesh
Ch  In the past when Saul was king it was you who went at the head of Israel when they went out or came in and the Lord your God said to you You are to be the keeper of my people Israel and their ruler
Ch  So all the responsible men of Israel came to the king at Hebron and David made an agreement with them in Hebron before the Lord and they put the holy oil on David and made him king over Israel as the Lord had said by Samuel

Ch  And he took up his position in the middle of the bit of land and kept back their attack and overcame the Philistines and the Lord gave a great salvation
Ch  And three of the thirty went down to David to the rock into the strong place of Adullam and the army of the Philistines had taken up their position in the valley of Rephaim
Ch  At that time David had taken cover in the strong place and an armed force of the Philistines was in Bethlehem
Ch  And David moved by a strong desire said If only someone would give me a drink of the water from the waterhole of Bethlehem by the doorway into the town
Ch  So the three forcing a way through the Philistine army got water from the waterhole of Bethlehem by the doorway into the town and took it back to David but David would not take it but made an offering of it draining it out to the Lord
Ch  Saying By my God far be it from me to do this How may I take as drink the lifeblood of these men who have put their lives in danger so he did not take it These things did the three great men of war

Ch  And some of the children of Benjamin and Judah came to David in his strong place
Ch  And David went out to them and said to them If you have come in peace to give me help my heart will be united with yours but if you have come to give me up to those who would take my life though my hands are clean from wrongdoing then may the God of our fathers see it and give you punishment
Ch  Then the spirit came on Amasai who was chief of the captains and he said We are yours David we are on your side O son of Jesse may peace be with you and peace be with your helpers for God is your helper Then David took them into his army and made them captains of the band
Ch  And some of the men of Manasseh came over to David when he went with the Philistines to the war against Saul but he gave them no help for the lords of the Philistines after discussion sent him away saying He will go back to his master Saul at the price of our lives
Ch  Then when he went back to Ziklag there came over to him of the men of Manasseh Adnah and Jozabad and Jediael and Michael and Jozabad and Elihu and Zillethai captains of thousands from the armies of Manasseh
Ch  And they gave David help against the armed bands for they were all great men of war and captains in the army

Ch  For three days they were there with David feasting at his table for their brothers had made ready food for them
Ch  And those who were near as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali came with food on asses and camels and mules and oxen with meal for food and cakes of figs and masses of grapes and wine and oil and oxen and sheep in great numbers for there was joy in Israel
Ch  Then David had discussions with the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds and with every chief
Ch  And David said to all the men of Israel who had come together there If it seems good to you and if it is the purpose of the Lord our God let us send to all the rest of our brothers everywhere in the land of Israel and to the priests and the Levites in their towns and the country round them and get them to come together here to us
Ch  And let us get back for ourselves the ark of our God for in the days of Saul we did not go to it for directions
Ch  And all the people said they would do so for it seemed right to them
Ch  So David sent for all Israel to come together from Shihor the river of Egypt as far as the way into Hamath to get the ark of God from Kiriathjearim
Ch  And David went up with all Israel to Baalah that is to Kiriathjearim in Judah to get up from there the ark of God over which the holy Name is named the name of the Lord whose place is between the winged ones
Ch  And they put the ark of God on a new cart and took it out of the house of Abinadab and Uzza and Ahio were the drivers of the cart
Ch  Then David and all Israel made melody before God with all their strength with songs and corded instruments of music and with brass instruments and horns
Ch  And when they came to the grainfloor of Chidon Uzza put out his hand to keep the ark in its place for the oxen were slipping
Ch  And the wrath of the Lord burning against Uzza sent destruction on him because he had put his hand on the ark and death came to him there before God
Ch  And David was angry because of the Lords outburst of wrath against Uzza and he gave that place the name Perezuzza to this day
Ch  And so great was Davids fear of God that day that he said How may I let the ark of God come to me
Ch  So David did not let the ark come back to him to the town of David but had it turned away and put into the house of Obededom the Gittite
Ch  And the ark of God was in the house of Obededom for three months and the Lord sent a blessing on the house of Obededom and on all he had
Ch  And Hiram king of Tyre sent men to David with cedartrees and stoneworkers and woodworkers for the building of his house
Ch  And David saw that the Lord had made his position safe as king over Israel lifting up his kingdom on high because of his people Israel
Ch  And while he was living in Jerusalem David took more wives and became the father of more sons and daughters
Ch  These are the names of the children he had in Jerusalem Shammua and Shobab Nathan and Solomon
Ch  And Ibhar and Elishua and Elpelet
Ch  And Nogah and Nepheg and Japhia
Ch  And Elishama and Beeliada and Eliphelet
Ch  And when the Philistines had news that David had been made king over all Israel they went up in search of David and David hearing of it went out against them
Ch  Now the Philistines had come and had gone out in every direction in the valley of Rephaim
Ch  And David desiring directions from God said Am I to go up against the Philistines and will you give them into my hands And the Lord said Go up for I will give them into your hands
Ch  So they went up to Baalperazim and David overcame them there and David said God has let the forces fighting against me be broken by my hand as a wall is broken down by rushing water so they gave that place the name of Baalperazim
Ch  And the Philistines did not take their images with them in their flight and at Davids orders they were burned with fire
Ch  Then the Philistines again went out in every direction in the valley
Ch  And David went for directions to God and God said to him You are not to go up after them but turning away from them come face to face with them opposite the spicetrees
Ch  And at the sound of footsteps in the tops of the trees go out to the fight for God has gone out before you to overcome the army of the Philistines
Ch  And David did as the Lord had said and they overcame the army of the Philistines attacking them from Gibeon as far as Gezer
Ch  And Davids name was honoured in all lands and the Lord put the fear of him on all nations
Ch  And David made houses for himself in the town of David and he got ready a place for the ark of God and put up a tent for it
Ch  Then David said The ark of God may not be moved by any but the Levites for they have been marked out by God to take the ark of God and to do his work for ever
Ch  And David made all Israel come together at Jerusalem to take the ark of the Lord to its place which he had got ready for it
Ch  And David got together the sons of Aaron and the Levites
Ch  Of the sons of Kohath Uriel the chief and his brothers a hundred and twenty
Ch  Of the sons of Merari Asaiah the chief and his brothers two hundred and twenty
Ch  Of the sons of Gershom Joel the chief and his brothers a hundred and thirty
Ch  Of the sons of Elizaphan Shemaiah the chief and his brothers two hundred
Ch  Of the sons of Hebron Eliel the chief and his brothers eighty
Ch  Of the sons of Uzziel Amminadab the chief and his brothers a hundred and twelve
Ch  And David sent for Zadok and Abiathar the priests and for the Levites Uriel Asaiah and Joel Shemaiah and Eliel and Amminadab
Ch  And said to them You are the heads of the families of the Levites make yourselves holy you and your brothers so that you may take the ark of the Lord the God of Israel to the place which I have made ready for it
Ch  For because you did not take it at the first the Lord our God sent punishment on us because we did not get directions from him in the right way
Ch  So the priests and the Levites made themselves holy to take up the ark of the Lord the God of Israel
Ch  And the sons of the Levites took up the ark of God lifting it by its rods as the Lord had said to Moses
Ch  And David gave orders to the chief of the Levites to put their brothers the musicmakers in position with instruments of music corded instruments and brass with glad voices making sounds of joy
Ch  So Heman the son of Joel and of his brothers Asaph the son of Berechiah and of the sons of Merari their brothers Ethan the son of Kushaiah were put in position by the Levites
Ch  And with them their brothers of the second order Zechariah Bani and Jaaziel and Shemiramoth and Jehiel and Unni Eliab and Benaiah and Maaseiah and Mattithiah and Eliphelehu and Mikneiah and Obededom and Jeiel the doorkeepers
Ch  So those who made melody Heman Asaph and Ethan were put in position with brass instruments sounding loudly
Ch  And Zechariah and Aziel and Shemiramoth and Jehiel Unni and Eliab and Maaseiah and Benaiah with corded instruments put to Alamoth
Ch  And Mattithiah and Eliphelehu and Mikneiah and Obededom and Jeiel and Azaziah with corded instruments on the octave to give the first note of the song
Ch  And Chenaniah chief of the Levites was master of the music he gave directions about the song because he was expert
Ch  And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark
Ch  And Shebaniah and Joshaphat and Nethanel and Amasai and Zechariah and Benaiah and Eliezer the priests made music on the horns before the ark of God and Obededom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark
Ch  So David and the responsible men of Israel and the captains over thousands went with joy to get the ark of the agreement of the Lord out of the house of Obededom
Ch  And when God gave help to the Levites who were lifting up the ark of the agreement of the Lord they made an offering of seven oxen and seven sheep
Ch  And David was clothed with a robe of fair linen as were all the Levites who took up the ark and those who made melody and Chenaniah the master of those who made melody and David had on a linen ephod
Ch  So all Israel took up the ark of the agreement of the Lord with loud cries and with horns and brass and corded instruments sounding loudly
Ch  And when the ark of the agreement of the Lord came into the town of David Michal the daughter of Saul looking out of the window saw King David dancing and playing and to her mind he seemed foolish
Ch  Then they took in the ark of God and put it inside the tent which David had put up for it and they made offerings burned offerings and peaceofferings before God
Ch  And when David had come to an end of making the burned offerings and peaceofferings he gave the people a blessing in the name of the Lord
Ch  And he gave to everyone every man and woman of Israel a cake of bread some meat and a cake of dry grapes
Ch  And he put some of the Levites before the ark of the Lord as servants to keep the acts of the Lord in memory and to give worship and praise to the Lord the God of Israel
Ch  Asaph the chief and second to him Zechariah Uzziel and Shemiramoth and Jehiel and Mattithiah and Eliab and Benaiah and Obededom and Jeiel with corded instruments of music and Asaph with brass instruments sounding loudly
Ch  And Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests blowing horns all the time before the ark of the agreement of God
Ch  Then on that day David first made the giving of praise to the Lord the work of Asaph and his brothers
Ch  O give praise to the Lord give honour to his name talking of his doings among the peoples
Ch  Let your voice be sounded in songs and melody let all your thoughts be of the wonder of his works
Ch  Have glory in his holy name let the hearts of those who are searching after the Lord be glad
Ch  Let your search be for the Lord and for his strength let your hearts ever be turned to him
Ch  Keep in mind the great works which he has done his wonders and the decisions of his mouth
Ch  O you seed of Israel his servant you children of Jacob his loved ones
Ch  He is the Lord our God he is judge of all the earth
Ch  He has kept his agreement in mind for ever the word which he gave for a thousand generations
Ch  The agreement which he made with Abraham and his oath to Isaac
Ch  And he gave it to Jacob for a law and to Israel for an eternal agreement
Ch  Saying To you will I give the land of Canaan the measured line of your heritage
Ch  When you were still small in number and strange in the land
Ch  When they went about from one nation to another and from one kingdom to another people
Ch  He would not let anyone do them wrong he even kept back kings because of them
Ch  Saying Put not your hand on those who have been marked with my holy oil and do my prophets no wrong
Ch  Make songs to the Lord all the earth give the good news of his salvation day by day
Ch  Make clear his glory to the nations and his wonders to all the peoples
Ch  For the Lord is great and greatly to be praised and he is more to be feared than all other gods
Ch  For all the gods of the nations are false gods but the Lord made the heavens
Ch  Honour and glory are before him strength and joy are in his holy place
Ch  Give to the Lord O you families of the peoples give to the Lord glory and strength
Ch  Give to the Lord the glory of his name take with you an offering and come before him give worship to the Lord in holy robes
Ch  Be in fear before him all the earth the world is ordered so that it may not be moved
Ch  Let the heavens have joy and let the earth be glad let them say among the nations The Lord is King
Ch  Let the sea be thundering with all its waters let the field be glad and everything which is in it
Ch  Then let all the trees of the wood be sounding with joy before the Lord for he is come to be the judge of the earth
Ch  O give praise to the Lord for he is good for his mercy is unchanging for ever
Ch  And say Be our saviour O God of our salvation and let us come back and give us salvation from the nations so that we may give honour to your holy name and have glory in your praise
Ch  Praise be to the Lord the God of Israel for ever and for ever And all the people said So be it and gave praise to the Lord
Ch  So he made Asaph and his brothers keep their places there before the ark of the agreement of the Lord to do whatever had to be done before the ark at all times day by day
Ch  And Obededom the son of Jeduthun and Hosah with their brothers sixtyeight of them to be doorkeepers
Ch  And Zadok the priest with his brothers the priests before the House of the Lord in the high place at Gibeon
Ch  To give burned offerings to the Lord on the altar of burned offerings morning and evening every day as it is ordered in the law of the Lord which he gave to Israel
Ch  And with them Heman and Jeduthun and the rest who were marked out by name to give praise to the Lord for his mercy is unchanging for ever
Ch  And Heman and Jeduthun had horns and brass instruments sounding loudly and instruments of music for the songs of God and the sons of Jeduthun were to be at the door
Ch  And all the people went away every man to his house and David went back to give a blessing to his family
Ch  Now when David was living in his house he said to Nathan the prophet See I am living in a house of cedarwood but the ark of the Lords agreement is under the curtains of a tent
Ch  And Nathan said to David Do whatever is in your heart for God is with you
Ch  But that same night the word of God came to Nathan saying
Ch  Go and say to David my servant The Lord says You are not to make me a house for my livingplace
Ch  For from the day when I took Israel up till this day I have had no house but have gone from tent to tent and from livingplace to livingplace
Ch  In all the places where I have gone with all Israel did I ever say to any of the judges of Israel whom I made the keepers of my people Why have you not made for me a house of cedar
Ch  So now say to my servant David The Lord of armies says I took you from the fields from keeping sheep so that you might be a ruler over my people Israel
Ch  And I have been with you wherever you went cutting off before you all those who were against you and I will make your name like the name of the greatest ones of the earth
Ch  And I will make a restingplace for my people Israel planting them there so that they may be in the place which is theirs and never again be moved and never again will they be made waste by evil men as they were at first
Ch  From the time when I put judges over my people Israel and I will overcome all those who are against you and I will make you great and the head of a line of kings
Ch  And when the time comes for you to go to your fathers I will put in your place your seed after you one of your sons and I will make his kingdom strong
Ch  He will be the builder of my house and I will make the seat of his authority certain for ever
Ch  I will be to him a father and he will be to me a son and I will not take my mercy away from him as I took it from him who was before you
Ch  But I will make his place in my house and in my kingdom certain for ever and the seat of his authority will never be overturned
Ch  So Nathan gave David an account of all these words and this vision
Ch  Then David the king went in and took his seat before the Lord and said Who am I O Lord God and what is my family that you have been my guide till now
Ch  And this was only a small thing to you O God but your words have even been about the faroff future of your servants family looking on me as on one of high position O Lord God
Ch  What more may David say to you for you have knowledge of your servant
Ch  O Lord because of your servant and from your heart you have done all these great things and let them be seen
Ch  O Lord there is no one like you and no other God but you as is clear from everything which has come to our ears
Ch  And what other nation in the earth like your people Israel did a god go out to take for himself to be his people making his name great and to be feared driving out the nations from before your people whom you made free and took out of Egypt
Ch  For your people Israel you made yours for ever and you Lord became their God
Ch  And now Lord let your words about your servant and about his family be made certain for ever and do as you have said
Ch  So let your words be made certain and your name be made great when men say The Lord of armies is the God of Israel and when the family of David your servant is made strong before you
Ch  For you O my God have let your servant see that you will make him head of a line of kings and so it has come into your servants heart to make his prayer to you
Ch  And now O Lord you are God and you have said you will give this good thing to your servant
Ch  And now you have been pleased to give your blessing to the family of your servant so that it may go on for ever before you you O Lord have given your blessing and a blessing will be on it for ever
Ch  And it came about after this that David made an attack on the Philistines and overcame them and took Gath with its daughtertowns out of the hands of the Philistines
Ch  And he overcame Moab and the Moabites became his servants and gave him offerings
Ch  Then David overcame Hadadezer king of Zobah near Hamath when he was going to make his power seen by the river Euphrates
Ch  And David took from him a thousand warcarriages and seven thousand horsemen and twenty thousand footmen and he had the legmuscles of all the horses cut keeping only enough of them for a hundred warcarriages
Ch  And when the Aramaeans of Damascus came to the help of Hadadezer king of Zobah David put to the sword twentytwo thousand Aramaeans
Ch  Then David put armed forces in Damascus and the Aramaeans became his servants and gave him offerings And the Lord made David overcome wherever he went
Ch  And the gold bodycovers of the servants of Hadadezer David took to Jerusalem
Ch  And from Tibhath and from Cun towns of Hadadezer David took a great store of brass of which Solomon made the great brass watervessel and the brass pillars and vessels
Ch  Now when Tou king of Hamath had news that David had overcome all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah
Ch  He sent his son Hadoram to King David to give him words of peace and blessing because he had overcome Hadadezer in the fight for Hadadezer had been at war with Tou and he gave him all sorts of vessels of gold and silver and brass
Ch  These King David made holy to the Lord together with the silver and gold he had taken from all nations from Edom and Moab and from the children of Ammon and from the Philistines and from Amalek
Ch  And when he came back from putting to the sword eighteen thousand of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt
Ch  David put armed forces in all the towns of Edom and all the Edomites became servants to David The Lord made David overcome wherever he went
Ch  So David was king over all Israel judging and giving right decisions for all his people
Ch  And Joab the son of Zeruiah was chief of the army and Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was keeper of the records
Ch  And Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were priests and Shavsha was the scribe
Ch  And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites and the sons of David were chief of those whose places were at the kings side
Ch  Now it came about after this that death came to Nahash the king of the children of Ammon and his son became king in his place
Ch  And David said I will be a friend to Hanun the son of Nahash because his father was a friend to me So David sent men to him to give him words of comfort on account of his father And the servants of David came to Hanun to the land of the children of Ammon offering him comfort
Ch  But the chiefs of the children of Ammon said to Hanun Does it seem to you that David is honouring your father by sending comforters to you is it not clear that these men have only come to go through the land and to make secret observation of it so that they may overcome it
Ch  So Hanun took Davids servants and cutting off their hair and the skirts of their robes up to the middle sent them away
Ch  Then certain men went and gave David word of what had been done to them And he sent out with the purpose of meeting them for the men were greatly shamed And the king said Keep where you are at Jericho till your hair is long again and then come back
Ch  And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves hated by David Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver as payment for warcarriages and horsemen from Mesopotamia and Arammaacah and Zobah
Ch  So with this money they got thirtytwo thousand warcarriages and the help of the king of Maacah and his people who came and took up their position in front of Medeba And the children of Ammon came together from their towns for the fight
Ch  And David hearing of it sent Joab with all the army of fightingmen
Ch  So the children of Ammon came out and put their forces in position on the way into the town and the kings who had come were stationed by themselves in the field
Ch  Now when Joab saw that their forces were in position against him in front and at his back he took all the best men of Israel and put them in line against the Aramaeans
Ch  And the rest of the people he put in position against the children of Ammon with Abishai his brother at their head
Ch  And he said If the Aramaeans are stronger and get the better of me then come to my help and if the children of Ammon get the better of you I will come to your help
Ch  Take heart and let us be strong for our people and for the towns of our God and may the Lord do what seems good to him
Ch  So Joab and the people who were with him went forward into the fight against the Aramaeans and they went in flight before him
Ch  And when the children of Ammon saw the flight of the Aramaeans they themselves went in flight from Abishai his brother and came into the town Then Joab came back to Jerusalem
Ch  And when the Aramaeans saw that Israel had overcome them they sent men to get the Aramaeans who were on the other side of the River with Shophach the captain of Hadadezers army at their head
Ch  And word of this was given to David and he got all Israel together and went over Jordan and came to Helam and put his forces in position against them And when Davids forces were in position against the Aramaeans the fight was started
Ch  And the Aramaeans went in flight before Israel and David put to the sword the men of seven thousand Aramaean warcarriages and forty thousand footmen and put to death Shophach the captain of the army
Ch  And when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were overcome by Israel they made peace with David and became his servants and the Aramaeans would give no more help to the children of Ammon
Ch  Now in the spring at the time when kings go out to war Joab went out at the head of the armed forces and made waste all the land of the Ammonites and put his men in position before Rabbah shutting it in But David was still at Jerusalem And Joab took Rabbah and made it waste
Ch  And David took the crown of Milcom from off his head its weight was a talent of gold and it had stones of great price in it and it was put on Davids head and he took a great store of goods from the town
Ch  And he took the people out of the town and put them to work with woodcutting instruments and iron graincrushers and axes And this he did to all the towns of the children of Ammon Then David and all the people went back to Jerusalem
Ch  Now after this there was war with the Philistines at Gezer then Sibbecai the Hushathite put to death Sippai one of the offspring of the Rephaim and they were overcome
Ch  And again there was war with the Philistines and Elhanan the son of Jair put to death Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite the stem of whose spear was like a clothworkers rod
Ch  And again there was war at Gath where there was a very tall man who had twentyfour fingers and toes six fingers on his hands and six toes on his feet he was one of the offspring of the Rephaim
Ch  And when he put shame on Israel Jonathan the son of Shimea Davids brother put him to death
Ch  These were of the offspring of the Rephaim in Gath they came to their death by the hands of David and his servants
Ch  Now Satan designing evil against Israel put into Davids mind the impulse to take the number of Israel
Ch  And David said to Joab and the captains of the people Now let all Israel from Beersheba to Dan be numbered and give me word so that I may be certain of their number
Ch  And Joab said May the Lord make his people a hundred times more in number than they are but my lord king are they not all my lords servants why would my lord have this done why will he become a cause of sin to Israel
Ch  But the kings word was stronger than Joabs So Joab went out and went through all Israel and came to Jerusalem
Ch  And Joab gave David the number of all the people all the men of Israel able to take up arms were one million one hundred thousand men and those of Judah were four hundred and seventy thousand men able to take up arms
Ch  But Levi and Benjamin were not numbered among them for Joab was disgusted with the kings order
Ch  And God was not pleased with this thing so he sent punishment on Israel
Ch  Then David said to God Great has been my sin in doing this but now be pleased to take away the sin of your servant for I have done very foolishly
Ch  Then the word of the Lord came to Gad Davids seer saying
Ch  Go and say to David The Lord says Three things are offered to you say which of them you will have so that I may do it to you
Ch  So Gad came to David and said to him The Lord says Take whichever you will
Ch  Three years when there will not be enough food or three months of war when you will go in flight before your haters being in great danger of the sword or three days of the sword of the Lord disease in the land and the angel of the Lord taking destruction through all the land of Israel Now give thought to the answer I am to take back to him who sent me
Ch  And David said to Gad This is a hard decision for me to make let me come into the hands of the Lord for great are his mercies let me not come into the hands of men
Ch  So the Lord sent disease on Israel causing the death of seventy thousand men
Ch  And God sent an angel to Jerusalem for its destruction and when he was about to do so the Lord saw and had regret for the evil and said to the angel of destruction It is enough do no more Now the angel of the Lord was by the grainfloor of Ornan the Jebusite
Ch  And David lifting up his eyes saw the angel of the Lord there between earth and heaven with an uncovered sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem Then David and the responsible men clothed in haircloth went down on their faces
Ch  And David said to God Was it not I who gave the order for the people to be numbered It is I who have done the sin and the great wrong but these are only sheep what have they done let your hand O Lord God be lifted up against me and against my family but not against your people to send disease on them
Ch  Then the angel of the Lord gave orders to Gad to say to David that he was to go and put up an altar to the Lord on the grainfloor of Ornan the Jebusite
Ch  And David went up as Gad had said in the name of the Lord
Ch  And Ornan turning back saw the angel and his four sons who were with him went to a secret place Now Ornan was crushing his grain
Ch  And when David came Ornan looking saw him and came out from the grainfloor and went down on his face to the earth before him
Ch  Then David said to Ornan Give me the place where this grainfloor is so that I may put up an altar here to the Lord let me have it for its full price so that this disease may be stopped among the people
Ch  And Ornan said to David Take it and let my lord the king do what seems right to him See I give you the oxen for burned offerings and the graincleaning instruments for firewood and the grain for the meal offering I give it all
Ch  And King David said to Ornan No I will certainly give you the full price for it because I will not take for the Lord what is yours or give a burned offering without payment
Ch  So David gave Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place
Ch  And David put up an altar there to the Lord offering burned offerings and peaceofferings with prayers to the Lord and he gave him an answer from heaven sending fire on the altar of burned offering
Ch  Then the Lord gave orders to the angel and he put back his sword into its cover
Ch  At that time when David saw that the Lord had given him an answer on the grainfloor of Ornan the Jebusite he made an offering there
Ch  For the House of the Lord which Moses had made in the waste land and the altar of burned offerings were at that time in the high place at Gibeon
Ch  But David was not able to go before it to get directions from the Lord so great was his fear of the sword of the angel of the Lord
Ch  Then David said This is the house of the Lord God and this is the altar for Israels burned offerings
Ch  And David gave orders to get together all the men from strange lands who were in the land of Israel and he put stonecutters to work cutting stones for building the house of God
Ch  And he got together a great store of iron for the nails for the doors and for the joins and brass more in weight than might be measured
Ch  And cedartrees without number for the Zidonians and the men of Tyre came with a great amount of cedartrees for David
Ch  And David said Solomon my son is young and untested and the house which is to be put up for the Lord is to be very great a thing of wonder and glory through all countries so I will make ready what is needed for it So David got ready a great store of material before his death
Ch  Then he sent for his son Solomon and gave him orders for the building of a house for the Lord the God of Israel
Ch  And David said to Solomon My son it was my desire to put up a house for the name of the Lord my God
Ch  But the word of the Lord came to me saying You have taken lives without number and made great wars I will not let you be the builder of a house for my name because of the lives you have taken on the earth before my eyes
Ch  But you will have a son who will be a man of rest and I will give him rest from wars on every side His name will be Solomon and in his time I will give Israel peace and quiet
Ch  He will be the builder of a house for my name he will be to me a son and I will be to him a father and I will make the seat of his rule over Israel certain for ever
Ch  Now my son may the Lord be with you and may you do well and put up the house of the Lord your God as he has said of you
Ch  Only may the Lord give you wisdom and knowledge of his orders for Israel so that you may keep the law of the Lord your God
Ch  And all will go well for you if you take care to keep the laws and the rules which the Lord gave to Moses for Israel be strong and take heart have no fear and do not be troubled
Ch  Now see poor though I am I have got ready for the house of the Lord a hundred thousand talents of gold and a million talents of silver and a weight of brass and iron greater than may be measured and wood and stone have I made ready and you may put more to it
Ch  And you have a great number of workmen cutters and workers of stone and wood and experts in every sort of work
Ch  In gold and silver and brass and iron more than may be numbered Up then and to work and may the Lord be with you
Ch  Then David gave orders to all the chiefs of Israel to give their help to Solomon his son saying
Ch  Is not the Lord your God with you and has he not given you rest on every side for the Lord has given the people of the land into my hands and the land is overcome before the Lord and before his people
Ch  Now give your heart and soul to the worship of the Lord your God and get to work on the building of the holy place of the Lord God so that you may put the ark of the Lords agreement and the holy vessels of God in the house which is to be made for the name of the Lord
Ch  Now David was old and full of days and he made his son Solomon king over Israel
Ch  And he got together all the chiefs of Israel with the priests and the Levites
Ch  And the Levites all those of thirty years old and over were numbered and the number of them by heads man by man was thirtyeight thousand
Ch  Of these twentyfour thousand were to be overseers of the work of the house of the Lord and six thousand were judges and men of authority
Ch  Four thousand were doorkeepers and four thousand gave praise to the Lord with the instruments which I made said David for giving praise
Ch  And David put them into divisions under the names of the sons of Levi Gershon Kohath and Merari
Ch  Of the Gershonites Ladan and Shimei
Ch  The sons of Ladan Jehiel the chief and Zetham and Joel three
Ch  The sons of Shimei Shelomoth and Haziel and Haran three these were the heads of the families of Ladan
Ch  And the sons of Shimei Jahath Zizah and Jeush and Beriah these four were the sons of Shimei
Ch  Jahath was the chief and Zizah the second but Jeush and Beriah had only a small number of sons so they were grouped together as one family
Ch  The sons of Kohath Amram Izhar Hebron and Uzziel four
Ch  The sons of Amram Aaron and Moses and Aaron was made separate and holy he and his sons for ever for the care of the most holy things and the burning of offerings before the Lord to do his work and give blessings in his name for ever
Ch  And the sons of Moses the man of God were put into the list of the tribe of Levi
Ch  The sons of Moses Gershom and Eliezer
Ch  The sons of Gershom Shebuel the first
Ch  And the sons of Eliezer Rehabiah the first and Eliezer had no other sons but Rehabiah had a great number
Ch  The sons of Izhar Shelomith the first
Ch  The sons of Hebron Jeriah the first Amariah the second Jahaziel the third and Jekameam the fourth
Ch  The sons of Uzziel Micah the first and Isshiah the second
Ch  The sons of Merari Mahli and Mushi the sons of Mahli Eleazar and Kish
Ch  And at his death Eleazar had no sons but only daughters and their relations the sons of Kish took them as wives
Ch  The sons of Mushi Mahli and Eder and Jeremoth three
Ch  These were the sons of Levi grouped by families the heads of the families of those who were numbered by name by heads all those of twenty years old and over who did the work of the house of the Lord
Ch  For David said The Lord the God of Israel has given his people rest and he has made his restingplace in Jerusalem for ever
Ch  And from now there will be no need for the House of the Lord and the vessels used in it to be moved about by the Levites
Ch  So among the last acts of David was the numbering of the sons of Levi from twenty years old and over
Ch  Their place was by the side of the sons of Aaron in all the work of the house of the Lord in the open spaces and in the rooms in the making clean of all the holy things in doing all the work of the house of the Lord
Ch  The holy bread was in their care and the crushed grain for the meal offering of unleavened cakes or meal cooked over the fire or in water they had control of all sorts of weights and measures
Ch  They had to take their places every morning to give praise and make melody to the Lord and in the same way at evening
Ch  At every offering of burned offerings to the Lord on Sabbaths and at the new moons and on the regular feasts in the number ordered by the law at all times before the Lord
Ch  And they had the care of the Tent of meeting and the holy place under the direction of the sons of Aaron their brothers for the work of the house of the Lord
Ch  Now the divisions into which the sons of Aaron were grouped were these the sons of Aaron Nadab and Abihu Eleazar and Ithamar
Ch  But Nadab and Abihu came to their end before their father and had no children so Eleazar and Ithamar did the work of priests
Ch  And David with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar made distribution of them into their positions for their work
Ch  And there were more chiefs among the sons of Eleazar than among the sons of Ithamar and this is how they were grouped of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen all heads of families and of the sons of Ithamar heads of families there were eight
Ch  So they were put into groups by the Lords decision one with another for there were rulers of the holy place and rulers of the house of God among the sons of Eleazar and the sons of Ithamar
Ch  And Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe who was a Levite put down their names in writing the king being present with the rulers and Zadok the priest and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar and the heads of families of the priests and the Levites one family being taken for Eleazar and then one for Ithamar and so on
Ch  Now the first name to come out was that of Jehoiarib the second Jedaiah
Ch  The third Harim the fourth Seorim
Ch  The fifth Malchijah the sixth Mijamin
Ch  The seventh Hakkoz the eighth Abijah

Ch  So they were put into their different groups to take their places in the house of the Lord in agreement with the rules made by Aaron their father as the Lord the God of Israel had given him orders
Ch  And of the rest of the sons of Levi of the sons of Amram Shubael of the sons of Shubael Jehdeiah

Ch  Of Mahli Eleazar who had no sons
Ch  Of Kish the sons of Kish Jerahmeel
Ch  And the sons of Mushi Mahli and Eder and Jerimoth These were the sons of the Levites by their families
Ch  Selection was made of these in the same way as of their brothers the sons of Aaron David the king being present with Zadok and Ahimelech and the heads of families of the priests and of the Levites the families of the chief in the same way as those of his younger brother
Ch  Further David and the chiefs of the servants of the holy place made selection of certain of the sons of Asaph and of Heman and of Jeduthun for the work of prophets to make melody with corded instruments and brass and the number of the men for the work they had to do was
Ch  Of the sons of Asaph Zaccur and Joseph and Nethaniah and Asharelah sons of Asaph under the direction of Asaph acting as a prophet under the orders of the king

Ch  All these were sons of Heman the kings seer in the words of God And to make great his power God gave Heman fourteen sons and three daughters
Ch  All these under the direction of their father made music in the house of the Lord with brass and corded instruments for the worship of the house of God Asaph Jeduthun and Heman being under the orders of the king
Ch  And the number of them with their brothers who were trained and expert in making melody to the Lord was two hundred and eightyeight
Ch  And selection was made of them for their special work all having equal chances small as well as great the teacher as the learner

Ch  From the goods taken in war they gave as a holy offering materials for the building of the house of the Lord
Ch  And everything Samuel the prophet and Saul the son of Kish and Abner the son of Ner and Joab the son of Zeruiah had made holy whatever anyone had given it was under the care of Shelomoth and his brothers

Ch  And his brothers were two thousand seven hundred able men heads of families whom King David made overseers over the Reubenites and the Gadites and the halftribe of Manasseh in everything to do with God and for the kings business
Ch  Now the number of the children of Israel that is the heads of families and the captains of thousands and of hundreds and the men in authority who were servants of the king in anything to do with the divisions which came in and went out month by month through all the months of the year in every division were twentyfour thousand

Ch  Of Dan Azarel the son of Jeroham These were the captains of the tribes of Israel
Ch  But David did not take the number of those who were under twenty years old for the Lord had said that he would make Israel like the stars of heaven in number
Ch  The numbering was started by Joab the son of Zeruiah but he did not go on to the end and because of it wrath came on Israel and the number was not recorded in the history of King David
Ch  And Azmaveth the son of Adiel was controller of the kings property Jonathan the son of Uzziah had control of all storehouses in country places and in the towns and little towns and strong places

Ch  Obil the Ishmaelite had control of the camels and Jehdeiah the Meronothite of the sheasses
Ch  The flocks were in the care of Jaziz the Hagarite All these were the controllers of King Davids property
Ch  Now Jonathan Davids fathers brother expert in discussion and a man of good sense was a scribe and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni had the care of the kings sons
Ch  And Ahithophel was the kings expert in discussion and Hushai the Archite was the kings friend
Ch  After Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah and Abiathar and the captain of the kings army was Joab
Ch  And David got together at Jerusalem all the rulers of Israel the chiefs of the tribes and the captains of the divisions waiting on the king in turn and the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds and the controllers of all the goods and property of the king and his sons with the unsexed servants and the great men of war
Ch  Then David the king got up and said Give ear to me my brothers and my people it was my desire to put up a house a restingplace for the ark of the Lords agreement and for the footrest of our God and I had got material ready for the building of it
Ch  But God said to me You are not to be the builder of a house for my name because you are a man of war and have taken life
Ch  Though the Lord the God of Israel took me out of all my fathers family to be king over Israel for ever marking out Judah to be chief and of the people of Judah my fathers family and among the sons of my father he was pleased to make me king over all Israel
Ch  And of all my sons for the Lord has given me a great number of sons he has made selection of Solomon to take his place on the seat of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel
Ch  And he said to me Solomon your son will be the builder of my house and the open spaces round it for I have taken him to be my son and I will be his father
Ch  I will keep his kingdom in its place for ever if he is strong at all times to do my orders and keep my rules as at this day
Ch  So now before the eyes of all Israel the people of the Lord and in the hearing of our God keep and be true to the orders of the Lord your God so that you may have this good land for yourselves and give it for a heritage to your children after you for ever
Ch  And you Solomon my son get knowledge of the God of your father and be his servant with a true heart and with a strong desire for the Lord is the searcher of all hearts and has knowledge of all the designs of mens thoughts if you make search for him he will be near you but if you are turned away from him he will give you up for ever
Ch  Now then take note for the Lord has made selection of you to be the builder of a house for the holy place Be strong and do it
Ch  Then David gave to his son Solomon the design of the doorway of the house of God and of its houses and its storehouses and the higher rooms and the inner rooms and the place for the mercyseat
Ch  And the design of all he had in his heart for the outer squares of the house of the Lord and for the rooms all round it and for the storehouses of the house of the Lord and for the storehouses for the holy things
Ch  And for the divisions of the priests and Levites and for all the work in connection with the worship of the house of the Lord and all the vessels used in the house of the Lord
Ch  Of gold by weight for the vessels of gold for all the vessels of different uses and silver for all the vessels of silver by weight for vessels of different uses
Ch  And gold by weight for the lightsupports and the vessels for the lights the weight of gold needed for every support and every vessel for lights and for the silver lightsupports the weight of silver needed for every support and for the different vessels as every one was to be used
Ch  And gold by weight for the tables for the holy bread for every table and silver for the silver tables
Ch  Clear gold for the meathooks and the basins and the cups for the gold basins gold enough by weight for every basin and silver by weight for every silver basin
Ch  And the best gold for the altar of perfumes and gold for the design of the carriage for the winged ones whose wings were outstretched covering the ark of the Lords agreement
Ch  All this said David the design for all these things has been made dear to me in writing by the hand of the Lord
Ch  And David said to his son Solomon Be strong and of a good heart and do your work have no fear and do not be troubled for the Lord God my God is with you he will not give you up and his face will not be turned away from you till all the work necessary for the house of the Lord is complete
Ch  And see there are the divisions of the priests and Levites for all the work of the house of God and every trained and expert workman will be ready to do for you whatever is needed and the captains and the people will be under your orders in everything
Ch  And David the king said to all the people Solomon my son the only one who has been marked out by God is still young and untested and the work is great for this great house is not for man but for the Lord God
Ch  Now as far as I am able I have made ready what is needed for the house of my God the gold for the things of gold and the silver for the silver things and the brass for the brass things iron for the things of iron and wood for the things of wood beryls and jewels to be framed and stones of different colours for ornament all sorts of stones of great price and polished buildingstone as much as is needed and more
Ch  And because this house of God is dear to me I give my private store of gold and silver to the house of my God in addition to all I have got ready for the holy house
Ch  Even three thousand talents of gold of Ophir and seven thousand talents of the best silver for plating the walls of the house
Ch  Gold for the gold things and silver for the silver things and for every sort of work to be done by the expert workmen Who then will come forward offering himself this day for the Lords work
Ch  Then the heads of families and the chiefs of the tribes of Israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds with the controllers of the kings business freely gave themselves
Ch  And they gave for the use of the house of the Lord five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold and ten thousand talents of silver and eighteen thousand talents of brass and a hundred thousand talents of iron
Ch  And those who had stones of great price gave them to the store of the house of the Lord under the care of Jehiel the Gershonite
Ch  Then the people were glad because their offerings were freely given for with a true heart they freely gave what they had to the Lord and David the king was full of joy
Ch  So David gave praise to the Lord before all the people and David said Praise be to you O Lord the God of Israel our father for ever and ever
Ch  Yours O Lord is the strength and the power and the glory and the authority and the honour for everything in heaven and on earth is yours yours is the kingdom O Lord and you are lifted up as head over all
Ch  Wealth and honour come from you and you are ruler over all and in your hand is power and strength it is in your power to make great and to give strength to all
Ch  So now our God we give you praise honouring the glory of your name
Ch  But who am I and what is my people that we have power to give so freely in this way for all things come from you and what we have given you is yours
Ch  For we as all our fathers were are like men from a strange country before you who have got a place for a time in the land our days on the earth are like a shade and there is no hope of going on
Ch  O Lord our God all this store which we have made ready for the building of a house for your holy name comes from your hand and is yours
Ch  And I am conscious my God that you are the searcher of hearts taking pleasure in righteousness As for me with an upright heart I have freely given all these things and I have seen with joy your people who are here to make their offerings freely to you
Ch  O Lord the God of Abraham of Isaac and of Israel our fathers keep this for ever in the deepest thoughts of your people and let their hearts be fixed and true to you
Ch  And give to Solomon my son a true heart to keep your orders your rules and your laws and to do all these things and to put up this great house for which I have made ready
Ch  And David said to all the people Now give praise to the Lord your God And all the people gave praise to the Lord the God of their fathers with bent heads worshipping the Lord and the king
Ch  And they made offerings to the Lord and gave burned offerings to the Lord on the day after a thousand oxen a thousand sheep and a thousand lambs with their drink offerings and a great wealth of offerings for all Israel
Ch  And with great joy they made a feast before the Lord that day And they made Solomon the son of David king a second time putting the holy oil on him to make him holy to the Lord as ruler and on Zadok as priest
Ch  So Solomon was put on the seat of the Lord as king in place of his father David and everything went well for him and all Israel was under his authority
Ch  And all the chiefs and the men of war and all the sons of King David put themselves under the authority of Solomon the king
Ch  And the Lord made Solomon great in the eyes of all Israel clothing him with glory and honour such as no other king in Israel had had before him
Ch  Now David the son of Jesse was king over all Israel
Ch  For forty years he was ruling as king over Israel seven years in Hebron and thirtythree years in Jerusalem
Ch  And he came to his end after a long life full of days and great wealth and honour and Solomon his son became king in his place
Ch  Now all the acts of David first and last are recorded in the words of Samuel the seer and the words of Nathan the prophet and the words of Gad the seer
Ch  Together with all his rule and his power and the events which took place in his time in Israel and in all the kingdoms of other lands
Ch  And Solomon the son of David made himself strong in his kingdom and the Lord his God was with him and made him very great
Ch  And Solomon sent word to all Israel to the captains of thousands and of hundreds and to the judges and to every chief in all Israel heads of their families
Ch  Then Solomon and all the men of Israel with him went to the high place at Gibeon because the Tent of meeting of God which Moses the servant of the Lord had made in the waste land was there
Ch  But the ark of God had been moved by David from Kiriathjearim to the place which he had made ready for it for he had put up a tent for it at Jerusalem
Ch  And the altar of brass which Bezalel the son of Uri the son of Hur had made was there before the Tent of the Lord and Solomon and all the people went to give worship there
Ch  And Solomon went up there to the brass altar before the Lord at the Tent of meeting offering on it a thousand burned offerings
Ch  In that night God came to Solomon in a vision and said to him Say what I am to give you
Ch  And Solomon said to God Great was your mercy to David my father and you have made me king in his place
Ch  Now O Lord God let your word to David my father come true for you have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in number
Ch  Give me now wisdom and knowledge so that I may go out and come in before this people for who is able to be the judge of this great people of yours
Ch  And God said to Solomon Because this was in your heart and you did not make request for money property or honour or for the destruction of your haters or for long life but you have made request for wisdom and knowledge for yourself so that you may be the judge of my people over whom I have made you king
Ch  Wisdom and knowledge are given to you and I will give you wealth and honour such as no king has had before you or ever will have after you
Ch  So Solomon went back from the high place at Gibeon from before the Tent of meeting to Jerusalem and he was king over Israel
Ch  And Solomon got together warcarriages and horsemen he had one thousand four hundred carriages and twelve thousand horsemen which he kept some in the carriagetowns and some with the king at Jerusalem
Ch  And the king made silver and gold as common as stones in Jerusalem and cedar like the sycamoretrees of the lowland in number
Ch  And Solomons horses came out of Egypt the kings traders got them from Kue at a price
Ch  A warcarriage might be got from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver and a horse for a hundred and fifty they got them at the same rate for all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram
Ch  Now it was Solomons purpose to put up a house for the name of the Lord and a house for himself as king
Ch  And Solomon had seventy thousand men numbered for transport and eighty thousand for cutting stone in the mountains and three thousand six hundred as overseers
Ch  And Solomon sent to Huram king of Tyre saying As you did for my father David sending him cedartrees for the building of his house
Ch  See I am building a house for the name of the Lord my God to be made holy to him where perfumes of sweet spices will be burned before him and the holy bread will be placed at all times and burned offerings will be offered morning and evening on the Sabbaths and at the new moons and on the regular feasts of the Lord our God This is a law for ever to Israel
Ch  And the house which I am building is to be great for our God is greater than all gods
Ch  But who may have strength enough to make a house for him seeing that the heaven and the heaven of heavens are not wide enough to be his restingplace who am I then to make a house for him But I am building it only for the burning of perfume before him
Ch  So now send me an expert worker in gold and silver and brass and iron in purple and red and blue and in the cutting of all sorts of ornament to be with the expert workmen who are here in Judah and in Jerusalem whom my father David got together
Ch  And send me cedartrees cypresstrees and sandalwood from Lebanon for to my knowledge your servants are expert woodcutters in Lebanon and my servants will be with yours
Ch  To get trees for me in great numbers for the house which I am building is to be great and a wonder
Ch  And I will give as food to your servants the woodcutters twenty thousand measures of grain and twenty thousand measures of barley and twenty thousand measures of wine and twenty thousand measures of oil
Ch  Then Huram king of Tyre sent Solomon an answer in writing saying Because of his love for his people the Lord has made you king over them
Ch  And Huram said Praise be to the Lord the God of Israel maker of heaven and earth who has given to David the king a wise son full of wisdom and good sense to be the builder of a house for the Lord and a house for himself as king
Ch  And now I am sending you a wise and expert man Huram who is as my father
Ch  The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan whose father was a man of Tyre an expert worker in gold and silver and brass and iron in stone and wood in purple and blue and fair linen and red trained in the cutting of every sort of ornament and the invention of every sort of design let him be given a place among your expert workmen and those of my lord your father David
Ch  So now let my lord send to his servants the grain and the oil and the wine as my lord has said
Ch  And we will have wood cut from Lebanon as much as you have need of and will send it to you on flat boats by sea to Joppa and from there you may take it up to Jerusalem
Ch  Then Solomon took the number of all the men from strange lands who were living in Israel as his father David had done there were a hundred and fiftythree thousand six hundred
Ch  Seventy thousand he put to the work of transport eighty thousand to cutting stone in the mountains and three thousand six hundred as overseers to put the people to work
Ch  Then Solomon made a start at building the house of the Lord on Mount Moriah in Jerusalem where the Lord had been seen by his father David in the place which David had made ready in the grainfloor of Ornan the Jebusite
Ch  The building was started in the second month in the fourth year of his rule
Ch  And Solomon put the base of the house of God in position by the older measure it was sixty cubits long and twenty cubits wide
Ch  And the covered way in front of the house was twenty cubits long as wide as the house and a hundred and twenty cubits high all plated inside with the best gold
Ch  And the greater house was roofed with cypresswood plated with the best gold and ornamented with designs of palmtrees and chains
Ch  And the house was made beautiful with stones of great value and the gold was gold of Parvaim
Ch  All the house was plated with gold the supports the steps the walls and the doors and the walls were ornamented with designs of winged ones
Ch  And he made the most holy place it was twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide like the greater house and was plated all over with the best gold six hundred talents were used for it
Ch  And fifty shekels weight of gold was used for the nails He had all the higher rooms plated with gold
Ch  And in the most holy place he made images of two winged beings covering them with gold
Ch  Their outstretched wings were twenty cubits across one wing five cubits long touching the wall of the house and the other of the same size meeting the wing of the other winged one
Ch  And in the same way the wings of the other five cubits long were stretched out one touching the wall and the other meeting the wing of the first winged one
Ch  Their outstretched wings were twenty cubits across they were placed upright on their feet facing the inner part of the house
Ch  And he made the veil of blue and purple and red of the best linen worked with winged ones
Ch  And in front of the house he made two pillars thirtyfive cubits high with crowns on the tops of them five cubits high
Ch  And he made chains like neck ornaments and put them on the tops of the pillars and a hundred apples on the chains
Ch  He put up the pillars in front of the Temple one on the right side and one on the left naming the one on the right Jachin and that on the left Boaz
Ch  Then he made a brass altar twenty cubits long twenty cubits wide and ten cubits high
Ch  And he made the great watervessel of metal round in form measuring ten cubits across from edge to edge it was five cubits high and thirty cubits round
Ch  And under it was a design of flowers all round it ten to a cubit circling the watervessel in two lines they were made from liquid metal at the same time as the watervessel
Ch  It was supported on twelve oxen three facing to the north three to the west three to the south and three to the east the watervessel resting on top of them their back parts were all turned to the middle of it
Ch  It was as thick as a mans open hand and the edge of it was curved like the edge of a cup like a lily flower it would take three thousand baths
Ch  And he made ten washingvessels putting five on the right side and five on the left such things as were used in making the burned offering were washed in them but the great watervessel was to be used by the priests for washing themselves
Ch  And he made the ten gold supports for the lights as directions had been given for them and he put them in the Temple five on the right side and five on the left
Ch  He made ten tables and put them in the Temple five on the right side and five on the left And he made a hundred gold basins
Ch  Then he made the open space for the priests and the great open space and its doors plating the doors with brass
Ch  He put the great watervessel on the right side of the house to the east facing south
Ch  And Huram made all the pots and the spades and the basins So he came to the end of all the work he did for King Solomon in the house of God
Ch  The two pillars and the two crowns on the tops of the pillars and the network covering the two cups of the crowns on the tops of the pillars
Ch  And the four hundred apples for the network two lines of apples for the network covering the two cups of the crowns on the pillars
Ch  And he made the ten bases and the ten washingvessels which were on the bases
Ch  The great watervessel with the twelve oxen under it
Ch  All the pots and the spades and the meathooks and their vessels which Huram who was as his father made for King Solomon for the house of the Lord were of polished brass
Ch  The king made them of liquid metal in the lowland of Jordan in the soft earth between Succoth and Zeredah
Ch  So Solomon made all these vessels a very great store of them and the weight of the brass used was not measured
Ch  And Solomon made all the vessels used in the house of God the gold altar and the tables on which the holy bread was placed
Ch  And the supports for the lights with their lights to be burning in the regular way in front of the inmost room of the best gold
Ch  The flowers and the vessels for the lights and the instruments used for them were all of gold it was the best gold
Ch  The scissors and the basins and the spoons and the firetrays of the best gold and the inner doors of the house opening into the most holy place and the doors of the Temple were all of gold
Ch  So all the work which Solomon did for the house of the Lord was complete And Solomon took the holy things which David his father had given the silver and the gold and all the vessels and put them in the storehouses of the house of God
Ch  Then Solomon sent for all the responsible men of Israel all the chiefs of the tribes and the heads of families of the children of Israel to come to Jerusalem and take the ark of the Lords agreement up out of the town of David which is Zion
Ch  And all the men of Israel came together to the king at the feast in the seventh month
Ch  All the responsible men of Israel came and the Levites took up the ark
Ch  They took up the ark and the Tent of meeting and all the holy vessels which were in the Tent all these the priests the Levites took up
Ch  And King Solomon and all the men of Israel who had come together there with him were before the ark making offerings of sheep and oxen more than might be numbered
Ch  And the priests took the ark of the Lords agreement and put it in its place in the inner room of the house in the most holy place under the wings of the winged ones
Ch  For their wings were outstretched over the place where the ark was covering the ark and its rods
Ch  The rods were so long that their ends were seen from the holy place before the inmost room but they were not seen from outside and there they are to this day
Ch  Nothing was in the ark but the two flat stones which Moses put there at Horeb where the Lord made an agreement with the children of Israel when they came out of Egypt
Ch  Now when the priests had come out of the holy place for all the priests who were present had made themselves holy not keeping to their divisions
Ch  And the Levites who made the music all of them Asaph Heman Jeduthun and their sons and brothers robed in fair linen were in their places with their brass and corded instruments at the east side of the altar and with them a hundred and twenty priests blowing horns
Ch  And when the players on horns and those who made melody in song with one voice were sounding the praise and glory of the Lord with loud voices and with wind instruments and brass and corded instruments of music praising the Lord and saying He is good his mercy is unchanging for ever then the house was full of the cloud of the glory of the Lord
Ch  So that the priests were not able to keep their places to do their work because of the cloud for the house of God was full of the glory of the Lord
Ch  Then Solomon said O Lord to the sun you have given the heaven for a livingplace but your livingplace was not seen by men
Ch  So I have made for you a livingplace a house in which you may be for ever present
Ch  Then turning his face about the king gave a blessing to all the men of Israel and they were all on their feet together
Ch  And he said Praise be to the Lord the God of Israel who himself gave his word to my father David and with his strong hand has made his word come true saying
Ch  From the day when I took my people out of the land of Egypt no town in all the tribes of Israel has been marked out by me for the building of a house for the restingplace of my name and I took no man to be a ruler over my people Israel
Ch  But now I have made selection of Jerusalem that my name might be there and of David to be over my people Israel
Ch  Now it was in the heart of my father David to put up a house for the name of the Lord the God of Israel
Ch  But the Lord said to David my father You did well to have in your heart the desire to make a house for my name
Ch  But you yourself will not be the builder of the house but your son the offspring of your body he it is who will put up a house for my name
Ch  And the Lord has kept his word for I have taken my father Davids place on the seat of the kingdom of Israel as the Lord gave his word and I have made the house for the name of the Lord the God of Israel
Ch  And there I have put the ark in which is the agreement of the Lord which he made with the people of Israel
Ch  Then he took his place in front of the altar of the Lord all the men of Israel being present
Ch  For Solomon had made a brass stage five cubits long five cubits wide and three cubits high and had put it in the middle of the open space on this he took his place and went down on his knees before all the meeting of Israel stretching out his hands to heaven
Ch  And he said O Lord the God of Israel there is no God like you in heaven or on earth keeping faith and mercy unchanging for your servants while they go in your ways with all their hearts
Ch  For you have kept the word which you gave to your servant David my father with your mouth you said it and with your hand you have made it come true this day
Ch  So now O Lord the God of Israel let your word to your servant David my father come true when you said You will never be without a man to take his place before me on the seat of the kingdom of Israel if only your children give attention to their ways walking in my law as you have done before me
Ch  So now O Lord the God of Israel make your word come true which you said to your servant David
Ch  But is it truly possible that God may be housed with men on earth see heaven and the heaven of heavens are not wide enough to be your restingplace how much less this house which I have made
Ch  Still let your heart be turned to the prayer of your servant and to his prayer for grace O Lord my God and give ear to the cry and the prayer which your servant makes before you
Ch  That your eyes may be open to this house day and night to this place of which you have said that you would put your name there to give ear to the prayer which your servant may make turning to this place
Ch  And give ear to the prayers of your servant and of your people Israel when they make their prayers turning to this place give ear from heaven your livingplace and hearing have mercy
Ch  If a man does wrong to his neighbour and has to take an oath and comes before your altar to take his oath in this house
Ch  Then let your ear be open in heaven and be the judge of your servants giving punishment to the wrongdoer so that his sin may come on his head and by your decision keeping from evil him who has done no wrong
Ch  And if your people Israel are overcome in war because of their sin against you if they are turned to you again honouring your name making prayers and requesting your grace in this house
Ch  Then give ear from heaven and let the sin of your people Israel have forgiveness and take them back again to the land which you gave to them and to their fathers
Ch  When heaven is shut up and there is no rain because of their sin against you if they make prayers with their faces turned to this place honouring your name and turning away from their sin when you send trouble on them
Ch  Then give ear from heaven so that the sin of your servants and the sin of your people Israel may have forgiveness when you make clear to them the good way in which they are to go and send rain on your land which you have given to your people for their heritage
Ch  If there is no food in the land if there is disease if the fruits of the earth are damaged by heat or water locust or worm if their towns are shut in by their attackers whatever trouble or whatever disease there may be
Ch  Whatever prayer or request for your grace is made by any man or by all your people Israel whatever his trouble may be whose hands are stretched out to this house
Ch  Then give ear from heaven your livingplace answering with forgiveness and give to every man whose secret heart is open to you the reward of all his ways for you and you only have knowledge of the hearts of the children of men
Ch  So that they may give you worship walking in your ways as long as they are living in the land which you gave to our fathers
Ch  And as for the man from a strange land who is not of your people Israel but comes from a far country because of the glory of your name and your strong hand and your outstretched arm when he comes to make his prayer turning to this house
Ch  Then give ear from heaven your livingplace and give him his desire whatever it may be so that all the peoples of the earth may have knowledge of your name worshipping you as do your people Israel and may see that this house which I have made is truly named by your name
Ch  If your people go out to war against their attackers by whatever way you may send them if they make their prayers to you turning their faces to this town of yours and to this house which I have put up for your name
Ch  Then give ear from heaven to their prayer and their cry for grace and see right done to them
Ch  If they do wrong against you for no man is without sin and you are angry with them and give them up into the power of those who are fighting against them so that they take them away prisoners to a land far off or near
Ch  And if they take thought in the land where they are prisoners turning again to you crying out in prayer to you in that land and saying We are sinners we have done wrong we have done evil
Ch  If with all their heart and soul they are turned again to you in the land where they are prisoners the land where they have been taken and make their prayers turning their eyes to their land which you gave to their fathers and to the town which you took for yourself and the house which I have made for your name
Ch  Then give ear from heaven your livingplace to their prayer and their cry and see right done to them answering with forgiveness your people who have done wrong against you
Ch  Now O my God may your eyes be open and your ears awake to the prayers made in this place
Ch  Up now O Lord God come back to your restingplace you and the ark of your strength let your priests O Lord God be clothed with salvation and let your saints be glad in what is good
Ch  O Lord God let him whom you have taken for yourself never be given up by you keep in mind your mercies to David your servant
Ch  Now when Solomons prayers were ended fire came down from heaven burning up all the offerings and the house was full of the glory of the Lord
Ch  And the priests were not able to go into the house of the Lord for the Lords house was full of the glory of the Lord
Ch  And all the children of Israel were looking on when the fire came down and the glory of the Lord was on the house and they went down on their knees with their faces to the earth worshipping and praising the Lord and saying He is good for his mercy is unchanging for ever
Ch  Then the king and all the people made offerings before the Lord
Ch  King Solomon made an offering of twentytwo thousand oxen and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep So the king and all the people kept the feast of the opening of the house of God
Ch  And the priests were in their places and the Levites with their instruments of music for the Lords song which David the king had made for the praise of the Lord whose mercy is unchanging for ever when David gave praise by their hand and the priests were sounding horns before them and all Israel were on their feet
Ch  Then Solomon made holy the middle of the open square in front of the house of the Lord offering the burned offerings there and the fat of the peaceofferings for there was not room on the brass altar which Solomon had made for all the burned offerings and the meal offerings and the fat
Ch  So Solomon kept the feast at that time for seven days and all Israel with him a very great meeting for the people had come together from the way into Hamath and from as far as the river of Egypt
Ch  And on the eighth day they had a holy meeting the offerings for making the altar holy went on for seven days and the feast for seven days
Ch  And on the twentythird day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents full of joy and glad in their hearts because of all the good which the Lord had done to David and to Solomon and to Israel his people
Ch  So Solomon came to the end of building the house of the Lord and the kings house and everything which it was in his mind to make in the house of the Lord and for himself had been well done
Ch  Now the Lord came to Solomon in a vision by night and said to him I have given ear to your prayer and have taken this place for myself as a house where offerings are to be made
Ch  If at my word heaven is shut up so that there is no rain or if I send locusts on the land for its destruction or if I send disease on my people
Ch  If my people on whom my name is named make themselves low and come to me in prayer searching for me and turning from their evil ways then I will give ear from heaven overlooking their sin and will give life again to their land
Ch  Now my eyes will be open and my ears awake to the prayers made in this place
Ch  For I have taken this house for myself and made it holy so that my name may be there for ever and my eyes and my heart will be there at all times
Ch  And as for you if you will go on your way before me as David your father did doing whatever I have given you orders to do and keeping my laws and my decisions
Ch  Then I will make strong the seat of your kingdom as I gave my word to David your father saying You will never be without a man to be ruler in Israel
Ch  But if you are turned away from me and do not keep my orders and my laws which I have put before you but go and make yourselves servants to other gods giving them worship
Ch  Then I will have this people uprooted out of my land which I have given them and this house which I have made holy for my name I will put away from before my eyes and make it an example and a word of shame among all peoples
Ch  And this house will become a mass of broken walls and everyone who goes by will be overcome with wonder and will say Why has the Lord done so to this land and to this house
Ch  And their answer will be Because they were turned away from the Lord the God of their fathers who took them out of the land of Egypt and took for themselves other gods and gave them worship and became their servants that is why he has sent all this evil on them
Ch  Now at the end of twenty years in which time Solomon had put up the house of the Lord and a house for himself
Ch  He took in hand the building up of the towns which Huram had given him causing the children of Israel to make livingplaces for themselves there
Ch  And Solomon went to Hamathzobah and overcame it
Ch  And he put up the buildings of Tadmor in the waste land and of all the storetowns in Hamath
Ch  And of Bethhoron the higher and the lower walled towns with walls and doorways and locks
Ch  And of Baalath and all the storetowns which Solomon had and the towns where he kept his warcarriages and his horse men and everything which it was his pleasure to put up in Jerusalem and in Lebanon and in all the land under his rule
Ch  As for all the rest of the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites who were not of Israel
Ch  Their men who were still living in the land and whom the children of Israel had not put an end to these Solomon put to forced work as is done to this day
Ch  But Solomon did not make use of the children of Israel as servants for his work they were men of war his chiefs and his captains and captains of his warcarriages and his horsemen
Ch  Now these were the chief men in authority whom King Solomon had two hundred and fifty of them in authority over the people
Ch  Then Solomon made Pharaohs daughter come up from the town of David to the house which he had made for her for he said I will not have my wife living in the house of David king of Israel because those places where the ark of the Lord has come are holy
Ch  Then Solomon made burned offerings to the Lord on the altar of the Lord which he had put up in front of the covered way
Ch  Offering every day what had been ordered by Moses on the Sabbaths and at the new moon and at the regular feasts three times a year that is at the feast of unleavened bread the feast of weeks and the feast of tents
Ch  And he gave the divisions of the priests their places for their work as ordered by his father David and to the Levites he gave their work of praise and waiting on the priests to do what was needed day by day and he gave the doorkeepers their places in turn at every door for so David the man of God had given orders
Ch  All the orders given by the king to the priests and Levites in connection with any business or stores were done with care
Ch  And all the work of Solomon was complete from the day when he put the base of the Lords house in position till Solomon had come to the end of building the Lords house
Ch  Then Solomon went to Eziongeber and to Eloth by the sea in the land of Edom
Ch  And Huram sent him by his servants ships and experienced seamen who went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir and came back with four hundred and fifty talents of gold which they took to King Solomon
Ch  Now the queen of Sheba hearing great things of Solomon came to Jerusalem to put his wisdom to the test with hard questions and with her came a very great train and camels weighted down with spices and great stores of gold and jewels and when she came to Solomon she had talk with him of everything in her mind
Ch  And Solomon gave her answers to all her questions there was no secret which he did not make clear to her
Ch  And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon and the house which he had made
Ch  And the food at his table and all his servants seated there and those who were waiting on him in their places and their robes and his wineservants and their robes and the burned offerings which he made in the house of the Lord there was no more spirit in her
Ch  And she said to the king The account which was given to me in my country of your acts and your wisdom was true
Ch  But I had no faith in what was said about you till I came and saw for myself and truly word was not given me of half your great wisdom you are much greater than they said
Ch  Happy are your wives and happy these your servants whose place is ever before you hearing your words of wisdom
Ch  Praise be to the Lord your God whose pleasure it was to put you on the seat of his kingdom to be king for the Lord your God because in his love for Israel it was the purpose of your God to make them strong for ever he made you king over them to be their judge in righteousness
Ch  And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold and a great store of spices and jewels never had such spices been seen as the queen of Sheba gave to Solomon
Ch  And the servants of Huram and the servants of Solomon in addition to gold from Ophir came back with sandalwood and jewels
Ch  And with the sandalwood the king made steps for the house of the Lord and for the kings house and instruments of music for the makers of melody never before had such been seen in the land of Judah
Ch  And King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all her desire whatever she made request for in addition to what she had taken to the king So she went back to her country with her servants
Ch  Now the weight of gold which came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixtysix talents
Ch  And in addition to what he got from traders of different sorts all the kings of Arabia and the rulers of the country gave gold and silver to Solomon
Ch  And King Solomon made two hundred bodycovers of hammered gold every one having six hundred shekels of gold in it
Ch  And he made three hundred smaller bodycovers of hammered gold using three hundred shekels of gold for every cover and the king put them in the house of the Woods of Lebanon
Ch  Then the king made a great ivory seat plated with the best gold
Ch  There were six steps up to it and a footrest of gold fixed to it and arms on the two sides of the seat with two lions at the side of the arms
Ch  And twelve lions were placed on one side and on the other side on the six steps there was nothing like it in any kingdom
Ch  All King Solomons drinkingvessels were of gold and all the vessels of the house of the Woods of Lebanon were of the best gold no one gave a thought to silver in the days of Solomon
Ch  For the king had Tarshishships sailing with the servants of Huram once every three years the Tarshishships came back with gold and silver ivory and monkeys and peacocks
Ch  And King Solomon was greater than all the kings of the earth in wealth and in wisdom
Ch  And all the kings of the earth came to see Solomon and to give ear to his wisdom which God had put into his heart
Ch  And everyone took with him an offering vessels of silver and vessels of gold and robes and coats of metal and spices and horses and beasts for transport regularly year by year
Ch  Solomon had four thousand buildings for his horses and his warcarriages and twelve thousand horsemen whom he kept some in the carriagetowns and some with the king in Jerusalem
Ch  And he was ruler over all the kings from the River to the land of the Philistines as far as the limit of Egypt
Ch  The king made silver as common as stones in Jerusalem and cedars like the sycamoretrees of the lowlands in number
Ch  They got horses for Solomon from Egypt and from every land
Ch  Now the rest of the acts of Solomon first and last are they not recorded in the history of Nathan the prophet and in the words of Ahijah the prophet of Shiloh and in the visions of Iddo the seer about Jeroboam the son of Nebat
Ch  Solomon was king over Israel in Jerusalem for forty years
Ch  And Solomon went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in the town of David his father and Rehoboam his son became king in his place
Ch  And Rehoboam went to Shechem where all Israel had come together to make him king
Ch  And when Jeroboam the son of Nebat had news of it for he was in Egypt where he had gone in flight from King Solomon he came back from Egypt
Ch  And they sent for him and Jeroboam and all Israel came to Rehoboam and said
Ch  Your father put a hard yoke on us if you will make the conditions under which your father kept us down less cruel and the weight of the yoke he put on us less hard then we will be your servants
Ch  And he said to them Come to me again after three days So the people went away
Ch  Then King Rehoboam took the opinion of the old men who had been with Solomon his father when he was living and said In your opinion what answer am I to give to this people
Ch  And they said to him If you are kind to this people pleasing them and saying good words to them then they will be your servants for ever
Ch  But he gave no attention to the opinion of the old men but went to the young men of his generation who were waiting before him
Ch  And he said to them What is your opinion What answer are we to give to this people who have said to me Make less the weight of the yoke which your father put on us
Ch  And the young men of his generation said to him This is the answer to give to the people who came to you saying Your father put a hard yoke on us but will you make it less say to them My little finger is thicker than my fathers body
Ch  If my father put a hard yoke on you I will make it harder my father gave you punishment with whips but I will give you blows with snakes
Ch  So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day as the king had given orders saying Come to me again on the third day
Ch  And the king gave them a rough answer So King Rehoboam gave no attention to the suggestion of the old men
Ch  But gave them the answer put forward by the young men saying My father made your yoke hard but I will make it harder my father gave you punishment with whips but I will give it with snakes
Ch  So the king did not give ear to the people for this came about by the purpose of God so that the Lord might give effect to his word which he had said by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat
Ch  And when all Israel saw that the king would give no attention to them the people in answer said to the king What part have we in David what is our heritage in the son of Jesse every man to your tents O Israel now see to your house David So all Israel went to their tents
Ch  But Rehoboam was still king over those of the children of Israel who were living in the towns of Judah
Ch  Then Rehoboam sent Adoniram the overseer of the forced work and he was stoned to death by all Israel And King Rehoboam went quickly and got into his carriage to go in flight to Jerusalem
Ch  So Israel was turned away from the family of David to this day
Ch  And Rehoboam came to Jerusalem and got together the men of Judah and Benjamin a hundred and eighty thousand of his best fightingmen to make war against Israel and get the kingdom back for Rehoboam
Ch  But the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah the man of God saying
Ch  Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon king of Judah and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin
Ch  The Lord has said You are not to go to war against your brothers let every man go back to his house for this thing is my purpose So they gave ear to the words of the Lord and were turned back from fighting against Jeroboam
Ch  Now Rehoboam kept in Jerusalem building walled towns in Judah
Ch  He was the builder of Bethlehem and Etam and Tekoa
Ch  And Bethzur and Soco and Adullam
Ch  And Gath and Mareshah and Ziph
Ch  And Adoraim and Lachish and Azekah
Ch  And Zorah and Aijalon and Hebron walled towns in Judah and Benjamin
Ch  And he made the walled towns strong and he put captains in them and stores of food oil and wine
Ch  And in every town he put stores of bodycovers and spears and made them very strong And Judah and Benjamin were his
Ch  And the priests and Levites who were in all Israel came together to him from every part of their country
Ch  For the Levites gave up their livingplaces and their property and came to Judah and Jerusalem for Jeroboam and his sons had sent them away not letting them be priests to the Lord
Ch  And he himself made priests for the high places and for the images of hegoats and oxen which he had made
Ch  And after them from all the tribes of Israel all those whose hearts were fixed and true to the Lord the God of Israel came to Jerusalem to make offerings to the Lord the God of their fathers
Ch  So they went on increasing the power of the kingdom of Judah and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong for three years and for three years they went in the ways of David and Solomon
Ch  And Rehoboam took as his wife Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse
Ch  And she had sons by him Jeush Shemariah and Zaham
Ch  And after her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom and she had Abijah and Attai and Ziza and Shelomith by him
Ch  Maacah the daughter of Absalom was dearer to Rehoboam than all his wives and his servantwives for he had eighteen wives and sixty servantwives and was the father of twentyeight sons and sixty daughters
Ch  Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maacah chief and ruler among his brothers for it was his purpose to make him king
Ch  And in his wisdom he had his sons stationed in every walled town through all the lands of Judah and Benjamin and he gave them a great store of food and took wives for them
Ch  Now when Rehoboams position as king had been made certain and he was strong he gave up the law of the Lord and all Israel with him
Ch  Now in the fifth year of King Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem because of their sin against the Lord
Ch  With twelve hundred warcarriages and sixty thousand horsemen and the people who came with him out of Egypt were more than might be numbered Lubim and Sukkiim and Ethiopians
Ch  And he took the walled towns of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem
Ch  Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the chiefs of Judah who had come together in Jerusalem because of Shishak and said to them The Lord has said Because you have given me up I have given you up into the hands of Shishak
Ch  Then the chiefs of Israel and the king made themselves low and said The Lord is upright
Ch  And the Lord seeing that they had made themselves low said to Shemaiah They have made themselves low I will not send destruction on them but in a short time I will give them salvation and will not let loose my wrath on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak
Ch  But still they will become his servants so that they may see how different my yoke is from the yoke of the kingdoms of the lands
Ch  So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem and took away all the stored wealth of the house of the Lord and the kings house he took everything away and with the rest the gold bodycovers which Solomon had made
Ch  And in their place King Rehoboam had other bodycovers made of brass and gave them into the care of the captains of the armed men who were stationed at the door of the kings house
Ch  And whenever the king went into the house of the Lord the armed men went with him taking the bodycovers and then took them back to their room
Ch  And when he made himself low the wrath of the Lord was turned back from him and complete destruction did not come on him for there was still some good in Judah
Ch  So King Rehoboam made himself strong in Jerusalem and was ruling there Rehoboam was fortyone years old when he became king and he was ruling for seventeen years in Jerusalem the town which the Lord had made his out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there and his mothers name was Naamah an Ammonite woman
Ch  And he did evil because his heart was not true to the Lord
Ch  Now the acts of Rehoboam first and last are they not recorded in the words of Shemaiah the prophet and Iddo the seer And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days
Ch  And Rehoboam went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in the town of David and Abijah his son became king in his place
Ch  In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam Abijah became king over Judah
Ch  He was king in Jerusalem for three years his mothers name was Maacah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam
Ch  And Abijah went out to the fight with an army of men of war four hundred thousand of his best men and Jeroboam put his forces in line against him eight hundred thousand of his best men of war
Ch  And Abijah took up his position on Mount Zemaraim in the hillcountry of Ephraim and said Give ear to me O Jeroboam and all Israel
Ch  Is it not clear to you that the Lord the God of Israel gave the rule over Israel to David and to his sons for ever by an agreement made with salt
Ch  But Jeroboam the son of Nebat the servant of Solomon the son of David took up arms against his lord
Ch  And certain foolish and goodfornothing men were joined with him and made themselves strong against Rehoboam the son of Solomon when he was young and untested and not able to keep them back
Ch  And now it is your purpose to put yourselves against the authority which the Lord has put into the hands of the sons of David and you are a very great number and you have with you the gold oxen which Jeroboam made to be your gods
Ch  And after driving out the priests of the Lord the sons of Aaron and the Levites have you not made priests for yourselves as the people of other lands do so that anyone who comes to make himself priest by offering an ox or seven sheep may be a priest of those who are no gods
Ch  But as for us the Lord is our God and we have not been turned away from him we have priests who do the work of the Lord even the sons of Aaron and the Levites in their places
Ch  By whom burned offerings and perfumes are sent up in smoke before the Lord every morning and every evening and they put out the holy bread on its table and the gold support for the lights with its lights burning every evening for we keep the orders given to us by the Lord our God but you have gone away from him
Ch  And now God is with us at our head and his priests with their loud horns sounding against you O children of Israel do not make war on the Lord the God of your fathers for it will not go well for you
Ch  But Jeroboam had put some of his men to make a surprise attack on them from the back so some were facing Judah and others were stationed secretly at their back
Ch  And Judah turning their faces saw that they were being attacked in front and at the back and they gave a cry for help to the Lord while the priests were sounding their horns
Ch  And the men of Judah gave a loud cry and at their cry God put fear into Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah
Ch  And the children of Israel went in flight before Judah and God gave them up into their hands
Ch  And Abijah and his people put them to death with great destruction five hundred thousand of the best of Israel were put to the sword
Ch  So at that time the children of Israel were overcome and the children of Judah got the better of them because they put their faith in the Lord the God of their fathers
Ch  And Abijah went after Jeroboam and took some of his towns Bethel with its small towns and Jeshanah with its small towns and Ephron with its small towns
Ch  And Jeroboam did not get back his power again in the lifetime of Abijah and the Lord sent death on him
Ch  But Abijah became great and had fourteen wives and became the father of twentytwo sons and sixteen daughters
Ch  And the rest of the acts of Abijah and his ways and his sayings are recorded in the account of the prophet Iddo
Ch  So Abijah went to rest with his fathers and they put him into the earth in the town of David and Asa his son became king in his place in his time the land was quiet for ten years
Ch  And Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the Lord his God
Ch  For he took away the altars of strange gods and the high places and had the upright stones broken and the wood pillars cut down
Ch  And he made Judah go after the Lord the God of their fathers and keep his laws and his orders
Ch  And he took away the high places and the sunimages from all the towns of Judah and the kingdom was quiet under his rule
Ch  He made walled towns in Judah for the land was quiet and there were no wars in those years because the Lord had given him rest
Ch  He said to Judah Let us make these towns building walls round them with towers and doors and locks The land is still ours because we have been true to the Lord our God we have been true to him and he has given us rest on every side So they went on building and all went well for them
Ch  And Asa had an army of three hundred thousand men of Judah armed with bodycovers and spears and two hundred and eighty thousand of Benjamin armed with bodycovers and bows all these were men of war
Ch  And Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a million and three hundred warcarriages came out against them to Mareshah
Ch  And Asa went out against him and they put their forces in position in the valley north of Mareshah
Ch  And Asa made prayer to the Lord his God and said Lord you only are able to give help against the strong to him who has no strength come to our help O Lord our God for our hope is in you and in your name we have come out against this great army O Lord you are our God let not mans power be greater than yours
Ch  So the Lord sent fear on the Ethiopians before Asa and Judah and the Ethiopians went in flight
Ch  And Asa and the people who were with him went after them as far as Gerar and so great was the destruction among the Ethiopians that they were not able to get their army together again for they were broken before the Lord and before his army and they took away a great amount of their goods
Ch  And they overcame all the towns round Gerar because the Lord sent fear on them and they took away their goods from the towns for there were stores of wealth in them
Ch  And they made an attack on the tents of the owners of the cattle and took away great numbers of sheep and camels and went back to Jerusalem
Ch  And the spirit of God came on Azariah the son of Oded
Ch  And he came face to face with Asa and said to him Give ear to me Asa and all Judah and Benjamin the Lord is with you while you are with him if your hearts desire is for him he will be near you but if you give him up he will give you up
Ch  Now for a long time Israel has been without the true God and without a teaching priest and without the law
Ch  But when in their trouble they were turned to the Lord the God of Israel searching after him he let their search be rewarded
Ch  In those times there was no peace for him who went out or for him who came in but great trouble was on all the people of the lands
Ch  And they were broken by divisions nation against nation and town against town because God sent all sorts of trouble on them
Ch  But be you strong and let not your hands be feeble for your work will be rewarded
Ch  And Asa hearing these words of Azariah the son of Oded the prophet took heart and put away all the disgusting things out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin and out of the towns which he had taken from the hillcountry of Ephraim and he made new again the altar of the Lord in front of the covered way of the Lords house
Ch  And he got together all Judah and Benjamin and those of Ephraim and Manasseh and Simeon who were living with them for numbers of them came to him out of Israel when they saw that the Lord his God was with him
Ch  So they came together at Jerusalem in the third month in the fifteenth year of the rule of Asa
Ch  And that day they made offerings to the Lord of the things they had taken in war seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep
Ch  And they made an agreement to be true to the Lord the God of their fathers with all their heart and all their soul
Ch  And that anyone small or great man or woman who was not true to the Lord the God of Israel would be put to death
Ch  And they made an oath to the Lord with a loud voice sounding windinstruments and horns
Ch  And all Judah was glad because of the oath for they had taken it with all their heart turning to the Lord with all their desire and he was with them and gave them rest on every side
Ch  And Asa would not let Maacah his mother be queen because she had made a disgusting image for Asherah and Asa had her image cut down and broken up and burned by the stream Kidron
Ch  But the high places were not taken away out of Israel but still the heart of Asa was true to the Lord all his life
Ch  He took into the house of God all the things which his father had made holy and those which he himself had made holy silver and gold and vessels
Ch  And there was no more war till the thirtyfifth year of the rule of Asa
Ch  In the thirtysixth year of the rule of Asa Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah building Ramah so that no one was able to go out or in to Asa king of Judah
Ch  Then Asa took silver and gold out of the stores of the Lords house and of the kings storehouse and sent to Benhadad king of Aram at Damascus saying
Ch  Let there be an agreement between me and you as there was between my father and your father see I have sent you silver and gold go and put an end to your agreement with Baasha king of Israel so that he may give up attacking me
Ch  And Benhadad did as King Asa said and sent the captains of his armies against the towns of Israel attacking Ijon and Dan and Abelmaim and all the storetowns of Naphtali
Ch  Then Baasha hearing of it put a stop to the building of Ramah and let his work come to an end
Ch  Then King Asa with all Judah took away the stones and wood with which Baasha was building Ramah and he made use of them for building Geba and Mizpah
Ch  At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him Because you have put your faith in the king of Aram and not in the Lord your God the army of the king of Aram has got away out of your hands
Ch  Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubim a very great army with warcarriages and horsemen more than might be numbered but because your faith was in the Lord he gave them up into your hands
Ch  For the eyes of the Lord go this way and that through all the earth letting it be seen that he is the strong support of those whose hearts are true to him In this you have done foolishly for from now you will have wars
Ch  Then Asa was angry with the seer and put him in prison burning with wrath against him because of this thing And at the same time Asa was cruel to some of the people
Ch  Now the acts of Asa first and last are recorded in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel
Ch  In the thirtyninth year of his rule Asa had a very bad disease of the feet but he did not go to the Lord for help in his disease but to medical men
Ch  So Asa went to rest with his fathers and death came to him in the fortyfirst year of his rule
Ch  And they put him into the restingplace which he had made for himself in the town of David in a bed full of sweet perfumes of all sorts of spices made by the perfumers art and they made a great burning for him
Ch  And Jehoshaphat his son became king in his place and made himself strong against Israel
Ch  He put forces in all the walled towns of Judah and responsible chiefs in the land of Judah and in the towns of Ephraim which Asa his father had taken
Ch  And the Lord was with Jehoshaphat because he went in the early ways of his father not turning to the Baals
Ch  But turning to the God of his father and keeping his laws and not doing as Israel did
Ch  So the Lord made his kingdom strong and all Judah gave offerings to Jehoshaphat and he had great wealth and honour
Ch  His heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord and he went so far as to take away the high places and the wood pillars out of Judah
Ch  In the third year of his rule he sent Benhail and Obadiah and Zechariah and Nethanel and Micaiah his captains as teachers into the towns of Judah
Ch  And with them Shemaiah and Nethaniah and Zebadiah and Asahel and Shemiramoth and Jehonathan and Adonijah and Tobijah and Tobadonijah the Levites and Elishama and Jehoram the priests
Ch  And they gave teaching in Judah and had the book of the law of the Lord with them they went through all the towns of Judah teaching the people
Ch  And the fear of the Lord was on all the kingdoms of the lands round Judah so that they made no wars against Jehoshaphat
Ch  And some of the Philistines took offerings to Jehoshaphat and made him payments of silver and the Arabians gave him flocks seven thousand seven hundred sheep and seven thousand seven hundred hegoats
Ch  Jehoshaphat became greater and greater and made strong towers and storetowns in Judah
Ch  He had much property in the towns of Judah he had forces of armed men great and strong in Jerusalem
Ch  This is the number of them listed by their families the captains of thousands of Judah Adnah the captain and with him three hundred thousand men of war
Ch  Second to him Jehohanan the captain and with him two hundred and eighty thousand
Ch  After him Amasiah the son of Zichri who freely gave himself to the Lord and with him two hundred thousand men of war
Ch  And the captains of Benjamin Eliada a great man of war and with him two hundred thousand armed with bows and bodycovers
Ch  And after him Jehozabad and with him a hundred and eighty thousand trained for war
Ch  These were the men who were waiting on the king in addition to those placed by the king in the walled towns through all Judah
Ch  Now Jehoshaphat had great wealth and honour and his son was married to Ahabs daughter
Ch  And after some years he went down to Samaria to see Ahab And Ahab made a feast for him and the people who were with him putting to death great numbers of sheep and oxen and he got Jehoshaphat to go with him to Ramothgilead
Ch  For Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah Will you go with me to Ramothgilead And he said I am as you are and my people as your people we will be with you in the war
Ch  Then Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel Let us now get directions from the Lord
Ch  So the king of Israel got together all the prophets four hundred men and said to them Am I to go to Ramothgilead to make war or not And they said Go up for God will give it into the hands of the king
Ch  But Jehoshaphat said Is there no other prophet of the Lord here from whom we may get directions
Ch  And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat There is still one man by whom we may get directions from the Lord but I have no love for him because he has never been a prophet of good to me but only of evil he is Micaiah the son of Imla And Jehoshaphat said Let not the king say so
Ch  Then the king of Israel sent for one of his unsexed servants and said Go quickly and come back with Micaiah the son of Imla
Ch  Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were seated on their seats of authority dressed in their robes by the doorway into Samaria and all the prophets were acting as prophets before them
Ch  And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made himself iron horns and said The Lord says Pushing back the Aramaeans with these you will put an end to them completely
Ch  And all the prophets said the same thing saying Go up to Ramothgilead and it will go well for you for the Lord will give it into the hands of the king
Ch  Now the servant who had gone to get Micaiah said to him See now all the prophets with one voice are saying good things to the king so let your words be like theirs and say good things
Ch  And Micaiah said By the living Lord whatever the Lord says to me I will say
Ch  When he came to the king the king said to him Micaiah are we to go to Ramothgilead to make war or not And he said Go up and it will go well for you and they will be given up into your hands
Ch  And the king said to him Have I not again and again put you on your oath to say nothing to me but what is true in the name of the Lord
Ch  Then he said I saw all Israel wandering on the mountains like sheep without a keeper and the Lord said These have no master let them go back every man to his house in peace
Ch  And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat Did I not say that he would not be a prophet of good to me but of evil
Ch  Then he said Give ear now to the word of the Lord I saw the Lord seated on his seat of power and all the army of heaven in their places at his right hand and at his left
Ch  And the Lord said How may Ahab king of Israel be tricked into going up to Ramothgilead to his death And one said one thing and one another
Ch  Then a spirit came forward and took his place before the Lord and said I will get him to do it by a trick And the Lord said to him How
Ch  And he said I will go out and be a spirit of deceit in the mouth of all his prophets And the Lord said Your trick will have its effect on him go out and do so
Ch  And now see the Lord has put a spirit of deceit in the mouth of these prophets of yours and the Lord has said evil against you
Ch  Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near and gave Micaiah a blow on the side of his face saying Where is the spirit of the Lord whose word is in you
Ch  And Micaiah said Truly you will see on that day when you go into an inner room to keep yourself safe
Ch  And the king of Israel said Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon the ruler of the town and to Joash the kings son
Ch  And say By the kings order this man is to be put in prison and given prison food till I come back in peace
Ch  And Micaiah said If you come back at all in peace the Lord has not sent his word by me
Ch  So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead
Ch  And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat I will make a change in my clothing so that I do not seem to be the king and will go into the fight but do you put on your robes So the king of Israel made a change in his dress and they went to the fight
Ch  Now the king of Aram had given orders to the captains of his warcarriages saying Make no attack on small or great but only on the king of Israel
Ch  So when the captains of the warcarriages saw Jehoshaphat they said It is the king of Israel And turning about they came round him but Jehoshaphat gave a cry and the Lord came to his help and God sent them away from him
Ch  Now when the captains of the warcarriages saw that he was not the king of Israel they went back from going after him
Ch  And a certain man sent an arrow from his bow without thought of its direction and gave the king of Israel a wound where his breastplate was joined to his clothing so he said to the driver of his warcarriage Go to one side and take me away out of the army for I am badly wounded
Ch  But the fight became more violent while the day went on and the king of Israel was supported in his warcarriage facing the Aramaeans till the evening and by sundown he was dead
Ch  And Jehoshaphat king of Judah went back to his house in Jerusalem in peace
Ch  And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went to King Jehoshaphat and said to him Is it right for you to go to the help of evildoers loving the haters of the Lord because of this the wrath of the Lord has come on you
Ch  But still there is some good in you for you have put away the wood pillars out of the land and have given your heart to the worship of God
Ch  And Jehoshaphat was living in Jerusalem and he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hillcountry of Ephraim guiding them back to the Lord the God of their fathers
Ch  And he put judges through all the land in every walled town of Judah
Ch  And said to the judges Take care what you do for you are judging not for man but for the Lord and he is with you in the decisions you give
Ch  So now let the fear of the Lord be in you do your work with care for in the Lord our God there is no evil or respect for high position or taking of payment to do wrong
Ch  Then in Jerusalem he gave authority to certain of the Levites and the priests and the heads of families of Israel to give decisions for the Lord and in the causes of those living in Jerusalem
Ch  And he gave them their orders saying You are to do your work in the fear of the Lord in good faith and with a true heart
Ch  And if any cause comes before you from your brothers living in their towns where the death punishment is in question or where there are questions of law or order or rules or decisions make them take care that they are not in the wrong before the Lord so that wrath may not come on you and on your brothers do this and you yourselves will not be in the wrong
Ch  And now Amariah the chief priest is over you in all questions to do with the Lord and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael the head of the family of Judah in everything to do with the kings business and the Levites will be overseers for you Be strong to do the work and may the Lord be with the upright
Ch  Now after this the children of Moab and the children of Ammon and with them some of the Meunim made war against Jehoshaphat
Ch  And they came to Jehoshaphat with the news saying A great army is moving against you from Edom across the sea and now they are in Hazazontamar which is Engedi
Ch  Then Jehoshaphat in his fear went to the Lord for directions and gave orders all through Judah for the people to go without food
Ch  And Judah came together to make prayer for help from the Lord from every town of Judah they came to give worship to the Lord
Ch  And Jehoshaphat took his place in the meeting of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of the Lord in front of the new open space
Ch  And said O Lord the God of our fathers are you not God in heaven are you not ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations and in your hands are power and strength so that no one is able to keep his place against you
Ch  Did you not O Lord our God after driving out the people of this land before your people Israel give it to the seed of Abraham your friend for ever
Ch  And they made it their livingplace building there a holy house for your name and saying
Ch  If evil comes on us the sword or punishment or disease or need of food we will come to this house and to you for your name is in this house crying to you in our trouble and you will give us salvation in answer to our cry
Ch  And now see the children of Ammon and Moab and the people of Mount Seir whom you kept Israel from attacking when they came out of Egypt so that turning to one side they did not send destruction on them
Ch  See now how as our reward they have come to send us out of your land which you have given us as our heritage
Ch  O our God will you not be their judge for our strength is not equal to this great army which is coming against us and we are at a loss what to do but our eyes are on you
Ch  And all Judah were waiting before the Lord with their little ones their wives and their children
Ch  Then before all the meeting the spirit of the Lord came on Jahaziel the son of Zechariah son of Benaiah son of Jeiel son of Mattaniah a Levite and one of the family of Asaph
Ch  And he said Give ear O Judah and you people of Jerusalem and you King Jehoshaphat the Lord says to you Have no fear and do not be troubled on account of this great army for the fight is not yours but Gods
Ch  Go down against them tomorrow see they are coming up by the slope of Ziz at the end of the valley before the waste land of Jeruel you will come face to face with them
Ch  There will be no need for you to take up arms in this fight put yourselves in position and keep where you are and you will see the salvation of the Lord with you O Judah and Jerusalem have no fear and do not be troubled go out against them tomorrow for the Lord is with you
Ch  Then Jehoshaphat went down with his face to the earth and all Judah and the people of Jerusalem gave worship to the Lord falling down before him
Ch  And the Levites the children of the Kohathites and the Korahites got to their feet and gave praise to the Lord the God of Israel with a loud voice
Ch  And early in the morning they got up and went out to the waste land of Tekoa and when they were going out Jehoshaphat took his station and said to them Give ear to me O Judah and you people of Jerusalem have faith in the Lord your God and you will be safe have faith in his prophets and all will go well for you
Ch  And after discussion with the people he put in their places those who were to make melody to the Lord praising him in holy robes while they went at the head of the army and saying May the Lord be praised for his mercy is unchanging for ever
Ch  And at the first notes of song and praise the Lord sent a surprise attack against the children of Ammon and Moab and the people of Mount Seir who had come against Judah and they were overcome
Ch  And the children of Ammon and Moab made an attack on the people of Mount Seir with a view to their complete destruction and when they had put an end to the people of Seir everymans hand was turned against his neighbour for his destruction
Ch  And Judah came to the watchtower of the waste land and looking in the direction of the army they saw only dead bodies stretched on the earth no living man was to be seen
Ch  And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take their goods from them they saw beasts in great numbers and wealth and clothing and things of value more than they were able to take away all this they took for themselves and they were three days getting it away there was so much
Ch  On the fourth day they all came together in the Valley of Blessing and there they gave blessing to the Lord for which cause that place has been named the Valley of Blessing to this day
Ch  Then all the men of Judah and Jerusalem went back with Jehoshaphat at their head coming back to Jerusalem with joy for the Lord had made them glad over their haters
Ch  So they came to Jerusalem with corded instruments and windinstruments into the house of the Lord
Ch  And the fear of God came on all the kingdoms of the lands when they had news of how the Lord made war on those who came against Israel
Ch  So the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was quiet for the Lord gave him rest on every side
Ch  And Jehoshaphat was king over Judah he was thirtyfive years old when he became king and he was ruling for twentyfive years in Jerusalem his mothers name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi
Ch  He went in the ways of his father Asa not turning away but doing right in the eyes of the Lord
Ch  The high places however were not taken away and the hearts of the people were still not true to the God of their fathers
Ch  Now as for the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat first and last they are recorded in the words of Jehu the son of Hanani which were put in the book of the kings of Israel
Ch  After this Jehoshaphat king of Judah became friends with Ahaziah king of Israel who did much evil
Ch  Together they made ships to go to Tarshish building them in Eziongeber
Ch  Then the word of Eliezer the prophet the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah came against Jehoshaphat saying Because you have let yourself be joined with Ahaziah the Lord has sent destruction on your works And the ships were broken and were not able to go to Tarshish
Ch  And Jehoshaphat went to rest with his fathers and his body was put into the earth in the town of David And Jehoram his son became king in his place
Ch  And he had brothers sons of Jehoshaphat Azariah Jehiel Zechariah Azariah Michael and Shephatiah all these were sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel
Ch  And their father gave them much silver and gold and things of great value as well as walled towns in Judah but the kingdom he gave to Jehoram because he was the oldest
Ch  Now when Jehoram had taken his place over his fathers kingdom and had made his position safe he put all his brothers to death with the sword as well as some of the princes of Israel
Ch  Jehoram was thirtytwo years old when he became king and he was ruling in Jerusalem for eight years
Ch  He went in the ways of the kings of Israel and did as the family of Ahab did for the daughter of Ahab was his wife and he did evil in the eyes of the Lord
Ch  But it was not the Lords purpose to send destruction on the family of David because of the agreement he had made with David when he said he would give to him and to his sons a light for ever
Ch  In his time Edom made themselves free from the rule of Judah and took a king for themselves
Ch  Then Jehoram went over with his captains and all his warcarriages  made an attack by night on the Edomites whose forces were all round him  on the captains of the warcarriages
Ch  So Edom made themselves free from the rule of Judah to this day and at the same time Libnah made itself free from his rule because he was turned away from the Lord the God of his fathers
Ch  And more than this he made high places in the mountains of Judah teaching the people of Jerusalem to go after false gods and guiding Judah away from the true way
Ch  And a letter came to him from Elijah the prophet saying The Lord the God of your father David says Because you have not kept to the ways of your father Jehoshaphat or the ways of Asa king of Judah
Ch  But have gone in the way of the kings of Israel and have made Judah and the people of Jerusalem go after false gods as the family of Ahab did and because you have put to death your fathers sons your brothers who were better than yourself
Ch  Now truly the Lord will send a great destruction on your people and your children and your wives and everything which is yours
Ch  And you yourself will undergo the cruel pains of a disease in your stomach so that day by day your inside will be falling out because of the disease
Ch  Then the Philistines and the Arabians who are by Ethiopia were moved by the Lord to make war on Jehoram
Ch  And they came up against Judah forcing a way into it and took away all the goods in the kings house as well as his sons and his wives so that he had no son but only Jehoahaz the youngest
Ch  And after all this the Lord sent on him a disease of the stomach from which it was impossible for him to be made well
Ch  And time went on and after two years his inside falling out because of the disease he came to his death in cruel pain And his people made no burning for him like the burning made for his fathers
Ch  He was thirtytwo years old when he became king and he was ruling in Jerusalem for eight years and at his death he was not regretted they put his body into the earth in the town of David but not in the restingplace of the kings
Ch  And the people of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his place for the band of men who came with the Arabians to the army had put all the older sons to death So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram became king
Ch  Ahaziah was twentytwo years old when he became king and he was ruling in Jerusalem for one year His mothers name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri
Ch  He went in the ways of the family of Ahab for his mother was his teacher in evildoing
Ch  And he did evil in the eyes of the Lord as the family of Ahab did for after the death of his father they were his guides to his destruction
Ch  Acting on their suggestion he went with Jehoram son of Ahab king of Israel to make war on Hazael king of Aram at Ramothgilead and Joram was wounded by the bowmen
Ch  And he went back to Jezreel to get well from the wounds which they had given him at Ramah when he was fighting against Hazael king of Aram And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to Jezreel to see Jehoram the son of Ahab because he was ill
Ch  Now by the purpose of God Ahaziahs journey to see Jehoram was the cause of his downfall for when he came there he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi who had been marked out by the Lord for the destruction of the family of Ahab
Ch  Now when Jehu was effecting the punishment of the family of Ahab he came to the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziahs brothers the servants of Ahaziah and put them to death
Ch  And he went in search of Ahaziah and when they came where he was for he was in a secret place in Samaria they took him to Jehu and put him to death then they put his body to rest in the earth for they said He is the son of Jehoshaphat whose heart was true to the Lord So the family of Ahaziah had no power to keep the kingdom
Ch  Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead she had all the rest of the seed of the kingdom of Judah put to death
Ch  But Jehoshabeath the daughter of the king secretly took Joash the son of Ahaziah away from among the kings sons who were put to death and put him and the woman who took care of him in a bedroom So Jehoshabeath the daughter of King Jehoram the wife of Jehoiada the priest and sister of Ahaziah kept him safe from Athaliah so that she did not put him to death
Ch  And she kept him safe with her in the house of God for six years while Athaliah was ruling the land
Ch  In the seventh year Jehoiada made himself strong and made an agreement with the captains of hundreds Azariah the son of Jeroham Ishmael the son of Jehohanan Azariah the son of Obed Maaseiah the son of Adaiah and Elishaphat the son of Zichri
Ch  And they went through Judah getting together the Levites and the heads of families in Israel from all the towns of Judah and they came to Jerusalem
Ch  And all the people made an agreement with the king in the house of God And he said to them Truly the kings son will be king as the Lord has said about the sons of David
Ch  This is what you are to do let a third of you of the priests and Levites who come in on the Sabbath keep the doors
Ch  And a third are to be stationed at the kings house and a third at the doorway of the horses while all the people are waiting in the open spaces round the house of the Lord
Ch  But let no one come into the house of the Lord but only the priests and those of the Levites who have work to do there they may go in for they are holy but the rest of the people are to keep the orders of the Lord
Ch  And the Levites are to make a circle round the king every man being armed and any man who comes into the house is to be put to death you are to keep with the king when he comes in and when he goes out
Ch  So the Levites and all Judah did as Jehoiada the priest had given them orders every one took with him his men those who were to come in and those who were to go out on the Sabbath for Jehoiada had not sent away the divisions
Ch  Then Jehoiada the priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and bodycovers which had been King Davids and which were kept in the house of God
Ch  And he put all the people in position every man with his instruments of war in his hand from the right side of the house to the left by the altar and the house and all round the king
Ch  Then they made the kings son come out and they put the crown on his head and gave him the armbands and made him king and Jehoiada and his sons put the holy oil on him and said Long life to the king
Ch  Now Athaliah hearing the noise of the people running and praising the king came to the people in the house of the Lord
Ch  And looking she saw the king in his place by the pillar at the doorway and the captains and the horns by his side and all the people of the land were giving signs of joy and sounding the horns and the makers of melody were playing on instruments of music taking the chief part in the song of praise Then Athaliah violently parting her robes said Broken faith broken faith
Ch  Then Jehoiada the priest gave orders to the captains of hundreds who had authority over the army saying Take her outside the lines and let anyone who goes after her be put to death with the sword For the priest said Let her not be put to death in the house of the Lord
Ch  So they put their hands on her and she went to the kings house by the doorway of the kings horses and there she was put to death
Ch  And Jehoiada made an agreement between the Lord and all the people and the king that they would be the Lords people
Ch  Then all the people went to the house of Baal and had it pulled down and its altars and images broken up and Mattan the priest of Baal they put to death before the altars
Ch  And Jehoiada put the work and the care of the house of the Lord into the hands of the priests and the Levites who had been grouped in divisions by David to make burned offerings to the Lord as it is recorded in the law of Moses with joy and song as David had said
Ch  And he put doorkeepers at the doors of the Lords house to see that no one who was unclean in any way might come in
Ch  Then he took the captains of hundreds and the chiefs and the rulers of the people and all the people of the land and they came down with the king from the house of the Lord through the higher doorway into the kings house and put the king on the seat of the kingdom
Ch  So all the people of the land were glad and the town was quiet for they had put Athaliah to death with the sword
Ch  Joash was seven years old when he became king and he was ruling for forty years in Jerusalem his mothers name was Zibiah of Beersheba
Ch  And Joash did what was right in the eyes of the Lord as long as Jehoiada the priest was living
Ch  And Jehoiada took two wives for him and he became the father of sons and daughters
Ch  Now after this Joash had a desire to put the house of the Lord into good order again
Ch  And getting together the priests and Levites he said to them Go out into the towns of Judah year by year and get from all Israel money to keep the house of your God in good condition and see that this is done without loss of time The Levites however were slow in doing so
Ch  Then the king sent for Jehoiada the chief priest and said to him Why have you not given the Levites orders that the tax fixed by Moses the servant of the Lord and by the meeting of Israel for the Tent of witness is to be got in from Judah and Jerusalem and handed over
Ch  For the house of the Lord had been broken up by Athaliah that evil woman and her sons and all its holy things they had given to the Baals
Ch  So at the kings order they made a chest and put it outside the doorway of the house of the Lord
Ch  And an order was sent out through all Judah and Jerusalem that payment was to be made to the Lord of the tax which Moses the servant of God had put on Israel in the waste land
Ch  And all the chiefs and all the people came gladly and put their money into the chest till they had all given
Ch  So when the chest was taken to the kings servants by the Levites and they saw that there was much money in it the kings scribe and the chief priests servant took the money out and put the chest back in its place They did this day by day and got together a great amount of money
Ch  Then the king and Jehoiada gave it to those who were responsible for getting the work done on the Lords house and with it they got wallbuilders and woodworkers and metalworkers to put the house of the Lord in good order again
Ch  So the workmen did their work making good what was damaged and building up the house of God till it was strong and beautiful again
Ch  And when the work was done they took the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada and it was used for making the vessels for the house of the Lord all the vessels needed for the offerings the spoons and the vessels of gold and silver And as long as Jehoiada was living the regular burned offerings were offered in the house of the Lord
Ch  But Jehoiada became old and full of days and he came to his end he was a hundred and thirty years old at the time of his death
Ch  And they put him into his last restingplace in the town of David among the kings because he had done good in Israel for God and for his house
Ch  Now after the death of Jehoiada the chiefs of Judah came and went down on their faces before the king Then the king gave ear to them
Ch  And they gave up the house of the Lord God of their fathers and became worshippers of pillars of wood and of the images and because of this sin of theirs wrath came on Judah and Jerusalem
Ch  And the Lord sent them prophets to make them come back to him and they gave witness against them but they would not give ear
Ch  Then the spirit of God came on Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest and getting up before the people he said to them God has said Why do you go against the orders of the Lord so that everything goes badly for you because you have given up the Lord he has given you up
Ch  But when they had made a secret design against him he was stoned with stones by the kings order in the outer square of the Lords house
Ch  So King Joash did not keep in mind how good Jehoiada his father had been to him but put his son to death And in the hour of his death he said May the Lord see it and take payment
Ch  Now in the spring the army of the Aramaeans came up against him they came against Judah and Jerusalem putting to death all the great men of the people and sending all the goods they took from them to the king of Damascus
Ch  For though the army of Aram was only a small one the Lord gave a very great army into their hands because they had given up the Lord the God of their fathers So they put into effect the punishment of Joash
Ch  And when they had gone away from him for he was broken with disease his servants made a secret design against him because of the blood of the son of Jehoiada the priest and they put him to death on his bed and they put his body into the earth in the town of David but not in the restingplace of the kings
Ch  Those who made designs against him were Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonite woman and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabite woman
Ch  Now the story of his sons and all the words said by the prophet against him and the building up again of the Lords house are recorded in the account in the book of the kings And Amaziah his son became king in his place
Ch  Amaziah was twentyfive years old when he became king and he was ruling in Jerusalem for twentynine years his mothers name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem
Ch  He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord but his heart was not completely true to the Lord
Ch  Now when he became strong in the kingdom he put to death those men who had taken the life of the king his father
Ch  But he did not put their children to death for he kept the orders of the Lord recorded in the book of the law of Moses saying The fathers are not to be put to death for their children or the children for their fathers but a man is to be put to death for the sin which he himself has done
Ch  Then Amaziah got all Judah together and put them in order by their families even all Judah and Benjamin under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds and he had those of twenty years old and over numbered and they came to three hundred thousand of the best fightingmen trained for war and in the use of the spear and the bodycover
Ch  And for a hundred talents of silver he got a hundred thousand fightingmen from Israel
Ch  But a man of God came to him saying O king let not the army of Israel go with you for the Lord is not with Israel that is the children of Ephraim
Ch  But go yourself and be strong in war God will not let you go down before those who are fighting against you for God has power to give help or to send you down before your attackers
Ch  Then Amaziah said to the man of God But what is to be done about the hundred talents which I have given for the armed band of Israel And the man of God in answer said God is able to give you much more than this
Ch  So Amaziah separating the armed band which had come to him from Ephraim sent them back again which made them very angry with Judah and they went back burning with wrath
Ch  Then Amaziah took heart and went out at the head of his people and came to the Valley of Salt where he put to death ten thousand of the children of Seir
Ch  And ten thousand more the children of Israel took living and made them go up to the top of the rock pushing them down from the top of the rock so that their bodies were broken by the fall
Ch  But the men of the band which Amaziah sent back and did not take with him to the fight made attacks on the towns of Judah from Samaria to Bethhoron putting to death three thousand of their people and taking away a great store of their goods
Ch  Now when Amaziah came back from the destruction of the Edomites he took the gods of the children of Seir and made them his gods worshipping them and burning offerings before them
Ch  And so the wrath of the Lord was moved against Amaziah and he sent a prophet to him who said Why have you gone after the gods of the people who have not given their people salvation from your hands
Ch  But while he was talking to him the king said to him Have we made you one of the kings government say no more or it will be the cause of your death Then the prophet gave up protesting and said It is clear to me that Gods purpose is your destruction because you have done this and have not given ear to my words
Ch  Then Amaziah king of Judah acting on the suggestion of his servants sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu king of Israel saying Come let us have a meeting face to face
Ch  And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah saying The thorntree in Lebanon sent to the cedar in Lebanon saying Give your daughter to my son for a wife and a beast from the woodland in Lebanon went by crushing the thorn under his feet
Ch  You say See I have overcome Edom and your heart is lifted up with pride now keep in your country why do you make causes of trouble putting yourself and Judah with you in danger of downfall
Ch  But Amaziah gave no attention and this was the purpose of God so that he might give them up into the hands of Joash because they had gone after the gods of Edom
Ch  And so Joash king of Israel went up and he and Amaziah king of Judah came face to face at Bethshemesh in Judah
Ch  And Judah was overcome before Israel and they went in flight every man to his tent
Ch  And Joash king of Israel made Amaziah king of Judah the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz prisoner at Bethshemesh and took him to Jerusalem and he had the wall of Jerusalem pulled down from the doorway of Ephraim to the doorway in the angle four hundred cubits
Ch  And he took all the gold and silver and all the vessels which were in the house of the Lord under the care of Obededom and all the wealth from the kings house as well as those whose lives would be the price of broken faith and went back to Samaria
Ch  Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah went on living for fifteen years after the death of Joash the son of Jehoahaz king of Israel
Ch  Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah first and last are they not recorded in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel
Ch  Now from the time when Amaziah gave up worshipping the Lord they made secret designs against him in Jerusalem and he went in flight to Lachish but they sent to Lachish after him and put him to death there
Ch  And they took his body on horseback and put it into the earth with his fathers in the town of David
Ch  Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah who was sixteen years old and made him king in place of his father Amaziah
Ch  He was the builder of Eloth which he got back for Judah after the death of the king
Ch  Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king and he was ruling in Jerusalem for fiftytwo years his mothers name was Jechiliah of Jerusalem
Ch  He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord as his father Amaziah had done
Ch  He gave himself to searching after God in the days of Zechariah who made men wise in the fear of God and as long as he was true to the Lord God made things go well for him
Ch  He went out and made war against the Philistines pulling down the walls of Gath and Jabneh and Ashdod and building towns in the country round Ashdod and among the Philistines
Ch  And God gave him help against the Philistines and against the Arabians living in Gurbaal and against the Meunim
Ch  The Ammonites gave offerings to Uzziah and news of him went out as far as the limit of Egypt for he became very great in power
Ch  Uzziah made towers in Jerusalem at the doorway in the angle and at the doorway in the valley and at the turn of the wall arming them
Ch  And he put up towers in the waste land and made places for storing water for he had much cattle in the low hills and in the table land and he had farmers and vinekeepers in the mountains and in the fertile land for he was a lover of farming
Ch  In addition Uzziah had an army of fightingmen who went out to war in bands as they had been listed by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler under the authority of Hananiah one of the kings captains
Ch  The heads of families the strong men of war were two thousand six hundred
Ch  And under their orders was a trained army of three hundred and seven thousand five hundred of great strength in war helping the king against any who came against him
Ch  And Uzziah had all these forces armed with bodycovers and spears and headcovers and coats of metal and bows and stones for sending from leather bands
Ch  And in Jerusalem he made machines the invention of expert men to be placed on the towers and angles of the walls for sending arrows and great stones And his name was honoured far and wide for he was greatly helped till he was strong
Ch  But when he had become strong his heart was lifted up in pride causing his destruction and he did evil against the Lord his God for he went into the Temple of the Lord for the purpose of burning perfumes on the altar of perfumes
Ch  And Azariah the priest went in after him with eighty of the Lords priests who were strong men
Ch  And they made protests to Uzziah the king and said to him The burning of perfumes Uzziah is not your business but that of the priests the sons of Aaron who have been made holy for this work go out of the holy place for you have done wrong and it will not be to your honour before God
Ch  Then Uzziah was angry and he had in his hand a vessel for burning perfume and while his wrath was bitter against the priests the mark of the lepers disease came out on his brow before the eyes of the priests in the house of the Lord by the altar of perfumes
Ch  And Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looking at him saw the mark of the leper on his brow and they sent him out quickly and he himself went out straight away for the Lords punishment had come on him
Ch  So King Uzziah was a leper till the day of his death living separately in his private house for he was cut off from the house of God and Jotham his son was ruling over his house judging the people of the land
Ch  Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah first and last were recorded by Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz
Ch  So Uzziah went to rest with his fathers and they put his body into the earth in the field used for the restingplace of the kings for they said He is a leper and Jotham his son became king in his place
Ch  Jotham was twentyfive years old when he became king and he was ruling in Jerusalem for sixteen years and his mothers name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok
Ch  He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord as his father Uzziah had done but he did not go into the Temple of the Lord And the people still went on in their evil ways
Ch  He put up the higher doorway of the house of the Lord and did much building on the wall of the Ophel
Ch  In addition he made towns in the hillcountry of Judah and strong buildings and towers in the woodlands
Ch  He went to war with the king of the children of Ammon and overcame them That year the children of Ammon gave him a hundred talents of silver and ten thousand measures of grain and ten thousand measures of barley And the children of Ammon gave him the same amount the second year and the third
Ch  So Jotham became strong because in all his ways he made the Lord his guide
Ch  Now the rest of the acts of Jotham and all his wars and his ways are recorded in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah
Ch  He was twentyfive years old when he became king and he was ruling in Jerusalem for sixteen years
Ch  And Jotham went to rest with his fathers and they put his body into the earth in the town of David and Ahaz his son became king in his place
Ch  Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king and he was ruling in Jerusalem for sixteen years he did not do what was right in the eyes of the Lord like David his father
Ch  But he went in the ways of the kings of Israel and made images of metal for the Baals
Ch  More than this he had offerings burned in the valley of the son of Hinnom and made his children go through fire copying the disgusting ways of the nations whom the Lord had sent out of the land before the children of Israel
Ch  And he made offerings and had perfumes burned in the high places and on the hills and under every green tree
Ch  So the Lord his God gave him up into the hands of the king of Aram and they overcame him and took away a great number of his people as prisoners to Damascus Then he was given into the hands of the king of Israel who sent great destruction on him
Ch  For Pekah the son of Remaliah in one day put to death a hundred and twenty thousand men of Judah all of them good fightingmen because they had given up the Lord the God of their fathers
Ch  And Zichri a great fightingman of Ephraim put to death Maaseiah the kings son and Azrikam the controller of his house and Elkanah who was second in authority to the king
Ch  And the children of Israel took away as prisoners from their brothers two hundred thousand women and sons and daughters and a great store of their goods and took them to Samaria
Ch  But a prophet of the Lord was there named Oded and he went out in front of the army which was coming into Samaria and said to them Truly because the Lord the God of your fathers was angry with Judah he gave them up into your hands and you have put them to death in an outburst of wrath stretching up to heaven
Ch  And now your purpose is to keep the children of Judah and Jerusalem as menservants and womenservants under your yoke but are there no sins against the Lord your God to be seen among yourselves
Ch  And now give ear to me and send back the prisoners whom you have taken from your brothers for the wrath of the Lord is burning against you
Ch  Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim Azariah the son of Johanan Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth Jehizkiah the son of Shallum and Amasa the son of Hadlai put themselves against those who had come from the war
Ch  And said to them You are not to let these prisoners come here for what you are designing to do will be a cause of sin against the Lord to us making even greater our sin and our wrongdoing which now are great enough and his wrath is burning against Israel
Ch  So the armed men gave up the prisoners and the goods they had taken to the heads and the meeting of the people
Ch  And those men who have been named went up and took the prisoners clothing those among them who were uncovered with things from the goods which had been taken in the war and putting robes on them and shoes on their feet and they gave them food and drink and oil for their bodies and seating all the feeble among them on asses they took them to Jericho the town of palmtrees to their people and then went back to Samaria
Ch  At that time King Ahaz sent for help to the king of Assyria
Ch  For the Edomites had come again attacking Judah and taking away prisoners
Ch  And the Philistines forcing their way into the towns of the lowlands and the south of Judah had taken Bethshemesh and Aijalon and Gederoth and Soco with their daughtertowns as well as Timnah and Gimzo and their daughtertowns and were living there
Ch  For the Lord made Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel for he had given up all selfcontrol in Judah sinning greatly against the Lord
Ch  Then Tiglathpileser king of Assyria came to him but was a cause of trouble and not of strength to him
Ch  For Ahaz took a part of the wealth from the house of the Lord and from the house of the king and of the great men and gave it to the king of Assyria but it was no help to him
Ch  And in the time of his trouble this same King Ahaz did even more evil against the Lord
Ch  For he made offerings to the gods of Damascus who were attacking him and said Because the gods of the kings of Aram are giving them help I will make offerings to them so that they may give me help But they were the cause of his downfall and of that of all Israel
Ch  And Ahaz got together the vessels of the house of God cutting up all the vessels of the house of God and shutting the doors of the Lords house and he made altars in every part of Jerusalem
Ch  And in every town of Judah he made high places where perfumes were burned to other gods awaking the wrath of the Lord the God of his fathers
Ch  Now the rest of his acts and all his ways first and last are recorded in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel
Ch  And Ahaz went to rest with his fathers and they put his body into the earth in Jerusalem but they did not put him in the restingplace of the kings of Israel and Hezekiah his son became king in his place
Ch  Hezekiah became king when he was twentyfive years old and he was king in Jerusalem for twentynine years and his mothers name was Abijah the daughter of Zechariah
Ch  He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord as his father David had done
Ch  In the first year of his rule in the first month opening the doors of the Lords house he made them strong
Ch  And he sent for the priests and the Levites and got them together in the wide place on the east side
Ch  And said to them Give ear to me O Levites now make yourselves holy and make holy the house of the Lord the God of your fathers and take away everything unclean from the holy place
Ch  For our fathers have done evil sinning in the eyes of the Lord our God and have given him up turning away their faces from the house of the Lord and turning their backs on him
Ch  The doors of his house have been shut and the lights put out no perfumes have been burned or offerings made to the God of Israel in his holy place
Ch  And so the wrath of the Lord has come on Judah and Jerusalem and he has given them up to be a cause of fear and wonder and shame as your eyes have seen
Ch  For see our fathers have been put to death with the sword and our sons and daughters and wives have been taken away prisoners because of this
Ch  Now it is my purpose to make an agreement with the Lord the God of Israel so that the heat of his wrath may be turned away from us
Ch  My sons take care now for you have been marked out by the Lord to come before him and to be his servants burning offerings to him
Ch  Then the Levites took their places Mahath the son of Amasai and Joel the son of Azariah among the Kohathites and of the sons of Merari Kish the son of Abdi and Azariah the son of Jehallelel and of the Gershonites Joah the son of Zimmah and Eden the son of Joah
Ch  And of the sons of Elizaphan Shimri and Jeuel and of the sons of Asaph Zechariah and Mattaniah
Ch  And of the sons of Heman Jehuel and Shimei and of the sons of Jeduthun Shemaiah and Uzziel
Ch  And they got their brothers together and made themselves holy and went in as the king had said by the word of the Lord to make the house of the Lord clean
Ch  And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the Lord to make it clean and everything unclean which was to be seen in the Temple of the Lord they took out into the outer square of the Lords house and the Levites got it together and took it away to the stream Kidron
Ch  On the first day of the first month the work of making the house holy was started and on the eighth day they came to the covered way of the Lord in eight days they made the Lords house holy and on the sixteenth day of the first month the work was done
Ch  Then they went in to King Hezekiah and said We have made all the house of the Lord clean as well as the altar of burned offerings with all its vessels and the table for the holy bread with all its vessels
Ch  And all the vessels which were turned out by King Ahaz in his sin while he was king we have put in order and made holy and now they are in their places before the altar of the Lord
Ch  Then Hezekiah the king got up early and got together the great men of the town and went up to the house of the Lord
Ch  And they took with them seven oxen and seven male sheep and seven lambs and seven hegoats as a sinoffering for the kingdom and for the holy house and for Judah And he gave orders to the sons of Aaron the priests that these were to be offered on the altar of the Lord
Ch  So they put the oxen to death and their blood was given to the priests to be drained out against the altar then they put the male sheep to death draining out their blood against the altar and they put the lambs to death draining out their blood against the altar
Ch  Then they took the hegoats for the sinoffering placing them before the king and the meeting of the people and they put their hands on them
Ch  And the priests put them to death and made a sinoffering with their blood on the altar to take away the sin of all Israel for the king gave orders that the burned offering and the sinoffering were for all Israel
Ch  Then he put the Levites in their places in the house of the Lord with brass and corded instruments of music as ordered by David and Gad the kings seer and Nathan the prophet for the order was the Lords given by his prophets
Ch  So the Levites took their places with Davids instruments and the priests with their horns
Ch  And Hezekiah gave the word for the burned offering to be offered on the altar And when the burned offering was started then the song of the Lord was started with the blowing of horns and with all the instruments of David king of Israel
Ch  And all the people gave worship to the sound of songs and the blowing of horns and this went on till the burned offering was ended
Ch  And at the end of the offering the king and all who were present with him gave worship with bent heads
Ch  Then King Hezekiah and the captains gave orders to the Levites to give praise to God in the words of David and Asaph the seer And they made songs of praise with joy and with bent heads gave worship
Ch  Then Hezekiah made answer and said Now that you have given yourselves to the Lord come near and take offerings and praiseofferings into the house of the Lord So all the people took in offerings and praiseofferings and those whose hearts were moved took in burned offerings
Ch  The number of burned offerings which the people took in was seventy oxen a hundred male sheep and two hundred lambs all these were for burned offerings to the Lord
Ch  And the holy things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep
Ch  There were not enough priests for the work of cutting up all the burned offerings so their brothers the Levites gave them help till the work was done and the priests had made themselves holy for the Levites were more upright in heart to make themselves holy than the priests
Ch  And there was a great amount of burned offerings with the fat of the peaceofferings and the drink offerings for every burned offering So the work of the Lords house was put in order
Ch  And Hezekiah and all the people were full of joy because God had made the people ready for the thing was done suddenly
Ch  Then Hezekiah sent word to all Israel and Judah and sent letters to Ephraim and Manasseh requesting them to come to the house of the Lord at Jerusalem to keep the Passover to the Lord the God of Israel
Ch  For the king after discussion with his chiefs and all the body of the people in Jerusalem had made a decision to keep the Passover in the second month
Ch  It was not possible to keep it at that time because not enough priests had made themselves holy and the people had not come together in Jerusalem
Ch  And the thing was right in the eyes of the king and all the people
Ch  So it was ordered that word was to be sent out through all Israel from Beersheba to Dan that they were to come to keep the Passover to the Lord the God of Israel at Jerusalem because they had not kept it in great numbers in agreement with the law
Ch  So runners went with letters from the king and his chiefs through all Israel and Judah by the order of the king saying O children of Israel come back again to the Lord the God of Abraham Isaac and Israel so that he may come again to that small band of you which has been kept safe out of the hands of the kings of Assyria
Ch  Do not be like your fathers and your brothers who were sinners against the Lord the God of their fathers so that he made them a cause of fear as you see
Ch  Now do not be hardhearted as your fathers were but give yourselves to the Lord and come into his holy place which he has made his for ever and be the servants of the Lord your God so that the heat of his wrath may be turned away from you
Ch  For if you come back to the Lord those who took away your brothers and your children will have pity on them and let them come back to this land for the Lord your God is full of grace and mercy and his face will not be turned away from you if you come back to him
Ch  So the runners went from town to town through all the country of Ephraim and Manasseh as far as Zebulun but they were laughed at and made sport of
Ch  However some of Asher and Manasseh and Zebulun put away their pride and came to Jerusalem
Ch  And in Judah the power of God gave them one heart to do the orders of the king and the captains which were taken as the word of the Lord
Ch  So a very great number of people came together at Jerusalem to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month
Ch  And they got to work and took away all the altars in Jerusalem and they put all the vessels for burning perfumes into the stream Kidron
Ch  Then on the fourteenth day of the second month they put the Passover lambs to death and the priests and the Levites were shamed and made themselves holy and took burned offerings into the house of the Lord
Ch  And they took their places in their right order as it was ordered in the law of Moses the man of God the priests draining out on the altar the blood given them by the Levites
Ch  For there were still a number of the people there who had not made themselves holy so the Levites had to put Passover lambs to death for those who were not clean to make them holy to the Lord
Ch  For a great number of the people from Ephraim and Manasseh Issachar and Zebulun had not made themselves clean but they took the Passover meal though not in the right way For Hezekiah had made prayer for them saying May the good Lord have mercy on everyone
Ch  Who with all his heart is turned to God the Lord the God of his fathers even if he has not been made clean after the rules of the holy place
Ch  And the Lord gave ear to Hezekiah and made the people well
Ch  So the children of Israel who were present in Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread for seven days with great joy and the Levites and the priests gave praise to the Lord day by day making melody to the Lord with loud instruments
Ch  And Hezekiah said kind words to the Levites who were expert in the ordering of the worship of the Lord so they kept the feast for seven days offering peaceofferings and praising the Lord the God of their fathers
Ch  And by the desire of all the people the feast went on for another seven days and they kept the seven days with joy
Ch  For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the people for offerings a thousand oxen and seven thousand sheep and the rulers gave a thousand oxen and ten thousand sheep and a great number of priests made themselves holy
Ch  And all the people of Judah with the priests and the Levites and those who had come from Israel and men from other lands who had come from Israel or who were living in Judah were glad with great joy
Ch  So there was great joy in Jerusalem for nothing like this had been seen in Jerusalem from the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel
Ch  Then the priests and the Levites gave the people a blessing and the voice of their prayer went up to the holy place of God in heaven
Ch  Now when all this was over all the men of Israel who were present went out into the towns of Judah causing the stone pillars to be broken up and the wood pillars to be cut down pulling down the high places and the altars in all Judah and Benjamin as well as in Ephraim and Manasseh till all were gone Then all the children of Israel went back to their towns every man to his property
Ch  Then Hezekiah put in order the divisions of the priests and Levites every man in his division in relation to his work for the burned offerings and peaceofferings and for the ordering of worship and for giving praise at the doors of the Lords house
Ch  And he gave the kings part of his private property for the burned offerings that is for the morning and evening offerings and the offerings for the Sabbath and the new moons and the regular feasts as it is recorded in the law of the Lord
Ch  In addition he gave orders to the people of Jerusalem to give to the priests and Levites that part which was theirs by right so that they might be strong in keeping the law of the Lord
Ch  And when the order was made public straight away the children of Israel gave in great amounts the firstfruits of their grain and wine and oil and honey and of the produce of their fields and they took in a tenth part of everything a great store
Ch  And the children of Israel and Judah who were living in the towns of Judah came with the tenth part of their oxen and sheep and a tenth of all the holy things which were to be given to the Lord their God and put them in great masses
Ch  The first store of things was put down in the third month and in the seventh month the masses were complete
Ch  And when Hezekiah and the rulers came and saw all the store of goods they gave praise to the Lord and to his people Israel
Ch  Then Hezekiah put questions to the priests and Levites about the store of goods
Ch  And Azariah the chief priest of the family of Zadok said in answer From the time when the people first came with their offerings into the house of the Lord we have had food enough and more than enough for the blessing of the Lord is on his people and there is this great store which has not been used
Ch  Then Hezekiah said that storerooms were to be made ready in the house of the Lord and this was done
Ch  And in them they put all the offerings and the tenths and the holy things keeping nothing back and over them was Conaniah the Levite with Shimei his brother second to him
Ch  And Jehiel and Azaziah and Nahath and Asahel and Jerimoth and Jozabad and Eliel and Ismachiah and Mahath and Benaiah were overseers under the directions of Conaniah and Shimei his brother by the order of Hezekiah the king and Azariah the ruler of the house of God
Ch  And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite the keeper of the east door had control of the offerings freely given to God and the distribution of the offerings of the Lord and the most holy things
Ch  And under him were Eden and Miniamin and Jeshua and Shemaiah and Amariah and Shecaniah in the towns of the priests who were made responsible for giving it to all their brothers by divisions to small and great
Ch  As well as to all the males of three years old and over listed by their families who went into the house of the Lord to do what was needed day by day for their special work with their divisions
Ch  And the families of the priests were listed by their fathers names but the Levites of twenty years old and over were listed in relation to their work in their divisions
Ch  And in the lists were all their little ones and their wives and their sons and daughters through all the people they made themselves holy in the positions which they were given
Ch  And as for the sons of Aaron the priests living in the country on the outskirts of their towns every different town there were men marked out by name to give their part of the goods to all the males among the priests and to all who were listed among the Levites
Ch  This Hezekiah did through all Judah he did what was good and right and true before the Lord his God
Ch  And for everything he undertook in connection with the work of the house of God and his law and orders he got directions from God and did it with serious purpose and things went well for him
Ch  Now after these things and this truehearted work Sennacherib king of Assyria came into Judah and put his army in position before the walled towns of Judah designing to make his way into them by force
Ch  And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come for the purpose of fighting against Jerusalem
Ch  He took up with his rulers and men of war the question of stopping up the watersprings outside the town and they gave him their support
Ch  So they got together a great number of people and had all the watersprings and the stream flowing through the land stopped up saying Why let the kings of Assyria come and have much water
Ch  Then he took heart building up the wall where it was broken down and making its towers higher and building another wall outside and he made strong the Millo in the town of David and got together a great store of all sorts of instruments of war
Ch  And he put war chiefs over the people and sent for them all to come together to him in the wide place at the doorway into the town and to give them heart he said to them
Ch  Be strong and take heart have no fear and do not be troubled on account of the king of Assyria and all the great army with him for there is a greater with us
Ch  With him is an arm of flesh but we have the Lord our God helping us and fighting for us And the people put their faith in what Hezekiah king of Judah said
Ch  After this Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem at that time he was stationed with all his army in front of Lachish to say to Hezekiah and all the men of Judah in Jerusalem
Ch  Sennacherib king of Assyria says In what are you placing your hope waiting here in the walled town of Jerusalem
Ch  Is it not Hezekiah who has got you to do it causing your death from need of food and water by saying The Lord our God will give us salvation out of the hands of the king of Assyria
Ch  Has not this same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars saying to Judah and Jerusalem Give worship before one altar only burning offerings on it
Ch  Have you no knowledge of what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of every land were the gods of the nations of those lands able to keep their land from falling into my hands
Ch  Who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers put to destruction who was able to keep his people safe from my hands and is it possible that your God will keep you safe from my hands
Ch  So do not be tricked by Hezekiah or let him get you to do this and do not put any faith in what he says for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to keep his people safe from my hands or the hands of my fathers how much less will your God keep you safe from my hands
Ch  And his servants said even more against the Lord God and against his servant Hezekiah
Ch  And he sent letters in addition to put shame on the Lord the God of Israel and to say evil against him saying As the gods of the nations of other lands have not been able to keep their people safe from my hands no more will the God of Hezekiah keep his people safe from my hands
Ch  These things they said crying out with a loud voice in the Jews language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall with the purpose of troubling them and putting fear into them so that they might take the town
Ch  Talking of the God of Jerusalem as if he was like the gods of the peoples of the earth the work of mens hands
Ch  And Hezekiah the king and Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz made prayer because of this crying out to heaven
Ch  And the Lord sent an angel who put to death all the men of war and the chiefs and the captains in the army of the king of Assyria So he went back to his country in shame And when he came into the house of his god his sons the offspring of his body put him to death there with the sword
Ch  So the Lord gave Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem salvation from the power of Sennacherib the king of Assyria and from all others giving them rest on every side
Ch  And great numbers came to Jerusalem with offerings for the Lord and things of great price for Hezekiah king of Judah so that he was honoured among all nations from that time
Ch  In those days Hezekiah was ill and near death and he made prayer to the Lord and the Lord in answer gave him a sign
Ch  But Hezekiah did not do as had been done to him for his heart was lifted up in pride and so wrath came on him and on Judah and Jerusalem
Ch  But then Hezekiah in sorrow for what he had done put away his pride and he and all Jerusalem made themselves low so that the wrath of the Lord did not come on them in Hezekiahs lifetime
Ch  And Hezekiah had very great wealth and honour and he made himself storehouses for his gold and silver and jewels and spices and for bodycovers and all sorts of beautiful vessels
Ch  And storehouses for the produce of grain and wine and oil and buildings for all sorts of beasts and flocks
Ch  And he made towns for himself and got together much property in flocks and herds for God had given him great wealth
Ch  It was Hezekiah who had the higher spring of the water of Gihon stopped and the water taken down on the west side of the town of David In everything he undertook Hezekiah did well
Ch  However in the business of the representatives sent by the rulers of Babylon to get news of the wonder which had taken place in the land God gave up guiding him testing him to see what was in his heart
Ch  Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and the good he did are recorded in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel
Ch  So Hezekiah went to rest with his fathers and they put his body into the higher part of the restingplaces of the sons of David and all Judah and the people of Jerusalem gave him honour at his death And Manasseh his son became king in his place
Ch  Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king and he was ruling for fiftyfive years in Jerusalem
Ch  He did evil in the eyes of the Lord copying the disgusting ways of the nations whom the Lord had sent out of the land before the children of Israel
Ch  For he put up again the high places which had been pulled down by his father Hezekiah and he made altars for the Baals and pillars of wood and was a worshipper and servant of all the stars of heaven
Ch  And he made altars in the house of the Lord of which the Lord had said In Jerusalem will my name be for ever
Ch  And he made altars for all the stars of heaven in the two outer squares of the house of the Lord
Ch  More than this he made his children go through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom and he made use of secret arts and signs for reading the future and unnatural powers and gave positions to those who had control of spirits and to wonderworkers he did much evil in the eyes of the Lord moving him to wrath
Ch  And he put the image he had made in the house of God the house of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son In this house and in Jerusalem the town which I have made mine out of all the tribes of Israel will I put my name for ever
Ch  And never again will I let the feet of Israel be moved out of the land which I have given to their fathers if only they will take care to do all my orders even all the law and the orders and the rules given to them by Moses
Ch  And Manasseh made Judah and the people of Jerusalem go out of the true way so that they did more evil than those nations whom the Lord gave up to destruction before the children of Israel
Ch  And the word of the Lord came to Manasseh and his people but they gave no attention
Ch  So the Lord sent against them the captains of the army of Assyria who made Manasseh a prisoner and took him away in chains to Babylon
Ch  And crying out to the Lord his God in his trouble he made himself low before the God of his fathers
Ch  And made prayer to him and in answer to his prayer God let him come back to Jerusalem and to his kingdom Then Manasseh was certain that the Lord was God
Ch  After this he made an outer wall for the town of David on the west side of Gihon in the valley as far as the way into the town by the fish doorway and he put a very high wall round the Ophel and he put captains of the army in all the walled towns of Judah
Ch  He took away the strange gods and the image out of the house of the Lord and all the altars he had put up on the hill of the Lords house and in Jerusalem and put them out of the town
Ch  And he put the altar of the Lord in order offering peaceofferings and praiseofferings on it and said that all Judah were to be servants of the Lord the God of Israel
Ch  However the people still made offerings in the high places but only to the Lord their God
Ch  Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh and his prayer to his God and the words which the seers said to him in the name of the Lord the God of Israel are recorded among the acts of the kings of Israel
Ch  And the prayer which he made to God and how God gave him an answer and all his sin and his wrongdoing and the places where he made high places and put up pillars of wood and images before he put away his pride are recorded in the history of the seers
Ch  So Manasseh went to rest with his fathers and they put his body to rest in his house and Amon his son became king in his place
Ch  Amon was twentytwo years old when he became king and he was ruling for two years in Jerusalem
Ch  He did evil in the eyes of the Lord as Manasseh his father had done and Amon made offerings to all the images which his father Manasseh had made and was their servant
Ch  He did not make himself low before the Lord as his father Manasseh had done but went on sinning more and more
Ch  And his servants made a secret design against him and put him to death in his house
Ch  But the people of the land put to death all those who had taken part in the design against King Amon and made his son Josiah king in his place
Ch  Josiah was eight years old when he became king he was ruling in Jerusalem for thirtyone years
Ch  And he did what was right in the eyes of the Lord walking in the ways of his father David without turning to the right hand or to the left
Ch  In the eighth year of his rule while he was still young his heart was first turned to the God of his father David and in the twelfth year he undertook the clearing away of all the high places and the pillars and the images of wood and metal from Judah and Jerusalem
Ch  He had the altars of the Baals broken down while he himself was present and the sunimages which were placed on high over them he had cut down and the pillars of wood and the metal images he had broken up and crushed to dust dropping the dust over the restingplaces of the dead who had made offerings to them
Ch  And he had the bones of the priests burned on their altars and so he made Judah and Jerusalem clean
Ch  And in all the towns of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon as far as Naphtali he made waste their houses round about
Ch  He had the altars and the pillars of wood pulled down and the images crushed to dust and all the sunimages cut down through all the land of Israel and then he went back to Jerusalem
Ch  Now in the eighteenth year of his rule when the land and the house had been made clean he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah and Maaseiah the ruler of the town and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder to make good what was damaged in the house of the Lord his God
Ch  And they came to Hilkiah the chief priest and gave him all the money which had been taken into the house of God which the Levites the keepers of the door had got from Manasseh and Ephraim and those of Israel who had not been taken away as prisoners and from all Judah and Benjamin and the people of Jerusalem
Ch  And they gave it to the overseers of the work of the Lords house and the overseers gave it to the workmen working in the house for building it up and making good what was damaged
Ch  Even to the woodworkers and builders to get cut stone and wood for joining the structure together and for making boards for the houses which the kings of Judah had given up to destruction
Ch  And the men did the work well and those who had authority over them were Jahath and Obadiah Levites of the sons of Merari and Zechariah and Meshullam of the sons of the Kohathites who were to be responsible for seeing that the work was done and others of the Levites who were expert with instruments of music
Ch  Had authority over the transport workers giving directions to all who were doing any sort of work and among the Levites there were scribes and overseers and doorkeepers
Ch  Now when they were taking out the money which had come into the Lords house Hilkiah the priest came across the book of the law of the Lord which he had given by the mouth of Moses
Ch  Then Hilkiah said to Shaphan the scribe I have made discovery of the book of the law in the house of the Lord And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan
Ch  And Shaphan took the book to the king and he gave him an account of what had been done saying Your servants are doing all they have been given to do
Ch  They have taken out all the money which was in the Lords house and have given it to the overseers and to the workmen
Ch  Then Shaphan the scribe said to the king Hilkiah the priest has given me a book and he made a start at reading some of it to the king
Ch  And the king hearing the words of the law took his robe in his hands violently parting it as a sign of his grief
Ch  And he gave orders to Hilkiah and to Ahikam the son of Shaphan and Abdon the son of Micah and Shaphan the scribe and Asaiah the kings servant saying
Ch  Go and get directions from the Lord for me and for those who are still in Israel and for Judah about the words of this book which has come to light for great is the wrath of the Lord which has been let loose on us because our fathers have not kept the word of the Lord or done what is recorded in this book
Ch  So Hilkiah and those whom the king sent went to Huldah the woman prophet the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath the son of Hasrah the keeper of the robes now she was living in Jerusalem in the second part of the town and they had talk with her about this thing
Ch  And she said to them The Lord the God of Israel has said Say to the man who sent you to me
Ch  These are the words of the Lord See I will send evil on this place and on its people even all the curses in the book which they have been reading before the king of Judah
Ch  Because they have given me up burning offerings to other gods and moving me to wrath by all the works of their hands so my wrath is let loose on this place and will not be put out
Ch  But to the king of Judah who sent you to get directions from the Lord say This is what the Lord the God of Israel has said Because you have given ear to my words
Ch  And your heart was soft and you made yourself low before God on hearing his words about this place and its people and with weeping and signs of grief have made yourself low before me I have given ear to you says the Lord God
Ch  See I will let you go to your fathers and be put in your last restingplace in peace and your eyes will not see all the evil which I will send on this place and on its people So they took this news back to the king
Ch  Then the king sent and got together all the responsible men of Judah and of Jerusalem
Ch  And the king went up to the house of the Lord with all the men of Judah and the people of Jerusalem and the priests and the Levites and all the people small and great and they were present at his reading of the book of the law which had come to light in the house of the Lord
Ch  Then the king taking his place by the pillar made an agreement before the Lord to go in the way of the Lord and to keep his orders and his decisions and his rules with all his heart and with all his soul and to keep the words of the agreement recorded in this book
Ch  And he made all the people in Jerusalem and Benjamin give their word to keep it And the people of Jerusalem kept the agreement of God the God of their fathers
Ch  Josiah took away all the disgusting things out of all the lands of the children of Israel and made all who were in Israel servants of the Lord their God And as long as he was living they were true to the Lord the God of their fathers
Ch  And Josiah kept a Passover to the Lord in Jerusalem on the fourteenth day of the first month they put the Passover lamb to death
Ch  And he gave the priests their places making them strong for the work of the house of God
Ch  And he said to the Levites the teachers of all Israel who were holy to the Lord See the holy ark is in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel made it will no longer have to be transported on your backs now be the servants of the Lord your God and his people Israel
Ch  And make yourselves ready in your divisions by your families as it is ordered in the writings of David king of Israel and of Solomon his son
Ch  And take your positions in the holy place grouped in the families of your brothers the children of the people and for every division let there be a part of a family of the Levites
Ch  And put the Passover lamb to death and make yourselves holy and make it ready for your brothers so that the orders given by the Lord through Moses may be done
Ch  And Josiah gave lambs and goats from the flock as Passover offerings for all the people who were present to the number of thirty thousand and three thousand oxen these were from the kings private property
Ch  And his captains freely gave an offering to the people the priests and the Levites Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel the rulers of the house of God gave to the priests for the Passover offerings two thousand six hundred small cattle and three hundred oxen
Ch  And Conaniah and Shemaiah and Nethanel his brothers and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad the chiefs of the Levites gave to the Levites for the Passover offerings five thousand small cattle and five hundred oxen
Ch  So everything was made ready and the priests took their places with the Levites in their divisions as the king had said
Ch  And they put the Passover lambs to death the blood being drained out by the priests when it was given to them and the Levites did the skinning
Ch  And they took away the burned offerings so that they might give them to be offered to the Lord for the divisions of the families of the people as it is recorded in the book of Moses And they did the same with the oxen
Ch  And the Passover lamb was cooked over the fire as it says in the law and the holy offerings were cooked in pots and basins and vessels and taken quickly to all the people
Ch  And after that they made ready for themselves and for the priests for the priests the sons of Aaron were offering the burned offerings and the fat till night so the Levites made ready what was needed for themselves and for the priests the sons of Aaron
Ch  And the sons of Asaph the makers of melody were in their places as ordered by David and Asaph and Heman and Jeduthun the kings seer and the doorkeepers were stationed at every door there was no need for them to go away from their places for their brothers the Levites made ready for them
Ch  So everything needed for the worship of the Lord was made ready that same day for the keeping of the Passover and the offering of burned offerings on the altar of the Lord as King Josiah had given orders
Ch  And all the children of Israel who were present kept the Passover and the feast of unleavened bread at that time for seven days
Ch  No Passover like it had been kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet and not one of the kings of Israel had ever kept a Passover like the one kept by Josiah and the priests and the Levites and all those of Judah and Israel who were present and the people of Jerusalem
Ch  In the eighteenth year of the rule of Josiah this Passover was kept
Ch  After all this and after Josiah had put the house in order Neco king of Egypt went up to make war at Carchemish by the river Euphrates and Josiah went out against him
Ch  But he sent representatives to him saying What have I to do with you O king of Judah I have not come against you this day but against those with whom I am at war and God has given me orders to go forward quickly keep out of Gods way for he is with me or he will send destruction on you
Ch  However Josiah would not go back but keeping to his purpose of fighting against him and giving no attention to the words of Neco which came from God he went forward to the fight in the valley of Megiddo
Ch  And the bowmen sent their arrows at King Josiah and the king said to his servants Take me away for I am badly wounded
Ch  So his servants took him out of the line of warcarriages and put him in his second carriage and took him to Jerusalem where he came to his end and they put his body in the restingplace of his fathers And in all Judah and Jerusalem there was great weeping for Josiah
Ch  And Jeremiah made a song of grief for Josiah and to this day Josiah is named by all the makers of melody men and women in their songs of grief they made it a rule in Israel and the songs are recorded among the songs of grief
Ch  Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and the good he did in keeping with what is recorded in the law of the Lord
Ch  And all his acts first and last are recorded in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah
Ch  Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah and made him king in Jerusalem in place of his father
Ch  Jehoahaz was twentythree years old when he became king he was ruling in Jerusalem for three months
Ch  Then the king of Egypt took the kingdom from him in Jerusalem and put on the land a tax of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold
Ch  And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem changing his name to Jehoiakim And Neco took his brother Jehoahaz away to Egypt
Ch  Jehoiakim was twentyfive years old when he became king he was ruling in Jerusalem for eleven years and he did evil in the eyes of the Lord his God
Ch  Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against him and took him away in chains to Babylon
Ch  And Nebuchadnezzar took away some of the vessels of the Lords house and put them in the house of his god in Babylon
Ch  Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim and the disgusting things he did and all there is to be said against him are recorded in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah and Jehoiachin his son became king in his place
Ch  Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king he was ruling in Jerusalem for three months and ten days and he did evil in the eyes of the Lord
Ch  In the spring of the year King Nebuchadnezzar sent and took him away to Babylon with the beautiful vessels of the house of the Lord and made Zedekiah his fathers brother king over Judah and Jerusalem
Ch  Zedekiah was twentyone years old when he became king he was ruling in Jerusalem for eleven years
Ch  He did evil in the eyes of the Lord and did not make himself low before Jeremiah the prophet who gave him the word of the Lord
Ch  And he took up arms against King Nebuchadnezzar though he had made him take an oath by God but he made his neck stiff and his heart hard turning away from the Lord the God of Israel
Ch  And more than this all the great men of Judah and the priests and the people made their sin great turning to all the disgusting ways of the nations and they made unclean the house of the Lord which he had made holy in Jerusalem
Ch  And the Lord the God of their fathers sent word to them by his servants sending early and frequently because he had pity on his people and on his livingplace
Ch  But they put shame on the servants of God making sport of his words and laughing at his prophets till the wrath of God was moved against his people till there was no help
Ch  So he sent against them the king of the Chaldaeans who put their young men to death with the sword in the house of their holy place and had no pity for any young man or virgin old man or whitehaired God gave them all into his hands
Ch  And all the vessels of the house of God great and small and the stored wealth of the Lords house and the wealth of the king and his chiefs he took away to Babylon
Ch  And the house of God was burned and the wall of Jerusalem broken down all its great houses were burned with fire and all its beautiful vessels given up to destruction
Ch  And all who had not come to death by the sword he took away prisoners to Babylon and they became servants to him and to his sons till the kingdom of Persia came to power
Ch  So that the words of the Lord which he said by the mouth of Jeremiah might come true till the land had had pleasure in her Sabbaths for as long as she was waste the land kept the Sabbath till seventy years were complete
Ch  Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia in order that the words which the Lord had said by the mouth of Jeremiah might come true the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia was moved by the Lord and he made a public statement and had it given out through all his kingdom and put in writing saying
Ch  Cyrus king of Persia has said All the kingdoms of the earth have been given to me by the Lord the God of heaven and he has made me responsible for building a house for him in Jerusalem which is in Judah Whoever there is among you of all his people may the Lord his God be with him and let him go up
Ezr  Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia in order that the word of the Lord given by the mouth of Jeremiah might come true the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia was moved by the Lord so that he made a public statement through all his kingdom and put it in writing saying
Ezr  These are the words of Cyrus king of Persia The Lord God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he has made me responsible for building a house for him in Jerusalem which is in Judah
Ezr  Whoever there is among you of his people may his God be with him and let him go up to Jerusalem which is in Judah and take in hand the building of the house of the Lord the God of Israel he is the God who is in Jerusalem
Ezr  And whoever there may be of the rest of Israel living in any place let the men of that place give him help with offerings of silver and gold and goods and beasts in addition to the offering freely given for the house of God in Jerusalem
Ezr  Then the heads of families of Judah and Benjamin with the priests and the Levites got ready even all those whose spirits were moved by God to go up and take in hand the building of the Lords house in Jerusalem
Ezr  And all their neighbours gave them help with offerings of vessels of silver and gold and goods and beasts and things of great value in addition to what was freely offered
Ezr  And Cyrus the king got out the vessels of the house of the Lord which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Jerusalem and put in the house of his gods
Ezr  Even these Cyrus made Mithredath the keeper of his wealth get out and he gave them after numbering them to Sheshbazzar the ruler of Judah
Ezr  And this is the number of them there were thirty gold plates a thousand silver plates twentynine knives
Ezr  Thirty gold basins four hundred and ten silver basins and a thousand other vessels
Ezr  There were five thousand four hundred gold and silver vessels All these were taken back by Sheshbazzar when those who had been taken prisoner went up from Babylon to Jerusalem
Ezr  Now these are the people of the divisions of the kingdom among those who had been made prisoners by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and taken away to Babylon who went back to Jerusalem and Judah everyone to his town

Ezr  The children of Shephatiah the children of Hattil the children of Pocherethhazzebaim the children of Ami
Ezr  All the Nethinim and the children of Solomons servants were three hundred and ninetytwo
Ezr  And these were the people who went up from Telmelah Telharsha Cherub Addan and Immer But having no knowledge of their fathers families or offspring it was not certain that they were Israelites
Ezr  The children of Delaiah the children of Tobiah the children of Nekoda six hundred and fiftytwo
Ezr  And of the children of the priests the children of Habaiah the children of Hakkoz the children of Barzillai who was married to one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite and took their name
Ezr  They made search for their record among the lists of families but their names were nowhere to be seen so they were looked on as unclean and no longer priests
Ezr  And the Tirshatha said that they were not to have the most holy things for their food till a priest came to give decision by Urim and Thummim
Ezr  The number of all the people together was fortytwo thousand three hundred and sixty
Ezr  As well as their menservants and their womenservants of whom there were seven thousand three hundred and thirtyseven and they had two hundred men and women to make music
Ezr  They had seven hundred and thirtysix horses two hundred and fortyfive transport beasts
Ezr  Four hundred and thirtyfive camels six thousand seven hundred and twenty asses
Ezr  And some of the heads of families when they came to the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem gave freely of their wealth for the building up of the house of God in its place
Ezr  Every one as he was able gave for the work sixtyone thousand darics of gold five thousand pounds of silver and a hundred priests robes
Ezr  So the priests and the Levites and the people and the musicmakers and the doorkeepers and the Nethinim took up their places in their towns even all Israel in their towns
Ezr  And when the seventh month came and the children of Israel were in the towns the people came together like one man to Jerusalem
Ezr  Then Jeshua the son of Jozadak and his brothers the priests and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel with his brothers got up and made the altar of the God of Israel for burned offerings as is recorded in the law of Moses the man of God
Ezr  They put the altar on its base for fear was on them because of the people of the countries and they made burned offerings on it to the Lord even burned offerings morning and evening
Ezr  And they kept the feast of tents as it is recorded making the regular burned offerings every day by number as it is ordered for every day what was needed
Ezr  And after that the regular burned offering and the offerings for the new moons and all the fixed feasts of the Lord which had been made holy and the offering of everyone who freely gave his offering to the Lord
Ezr  From the first day of the seventh month they made a start with the burned offerings but the base of the Temple of the Lord had still not been put in its place
Ezr  And they gave money to the stoneworkers and woodworkers and meat and drink and oil to the people of Zidon and of Tyre for the transport of cedartrees from Lebanon to the sea to Joppa as Cyrus king of Persia had given them authority to do
Ezr  Now in the second year of their coming into the house of God in Jerusalem in the second month the work was taken in hand by Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak and the rest of their brothers the priests and the Levites and all those who had come from the land where they were prisoners to Jerusalem and they made the Levites of twenty years old and over responsible for overseeing the work of the house of the Lord
Ezr  Then Jeshua with his sons and his brothers Kadmiel with his sons the sons of Hodaviah together took up the work of overseeing the workmen in the house of God the sons of Henadad with their sons and their brothers the Levites
Ezr  And when the builders put in position the base of the Temple of the Lord the priests dressed in their robes took their places with horns and the Levites the sons of Asaph with brass instruments to give praise to the Lord in the way ordered by David king of Israel
Ezr  And they gave praise to the Lord answering one another in their songs and saying For he is good for his mercy to Israel is eternal And all the people gave a great cry of joy when they gave praise to the Lord because the base of the Lords house was put in place
Ezr  But a number of the priests and Levites and the heads of families old men who had seen the first house when the base of this house was put down before their eyes were overcome with weeping and a number were crying out with joy
Ezr  So that in the ears of the people the cry of joy was mixed with the sound of weeping for the cries of the people were loud and came to the ears of those who were a long way off
Ezr  Now news came to the haters of Judah and Benjamin that the people who had come back were building a Temple to the Lord the God of Israel
Ezr  Then they came to Zerubbabel and to the heads of families and said to them Let us take part in the building with you for we are servants of your God even as you are and we have been making offerings to him from the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria who put us here
Ezr  But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the heads of families in Israel said to them You have no part with us in the building of a house for our God we ourselves will do the work together for the Lord the God of Israel as Cyrus king of Persia has given us orders
Ezr  Then the people of the land made the hands of the people of Judah feeble troubling them with fear in their building
Ezr  And they gave payment to men who made designs against them and kept them from effecting their purpose all through the time of Cyrus king of Persia till Darius became king
Ezr  And in the time of Ahasuerus when he first became king they put on record a statement against the people of Judah and Jerusalem
Ezr  And in the time of Artaxerxes Bishlam Mithredath Tabeel and the rest of his friends sent a letter to Artaxerxes king of Persia writing it in the Aramaean writing and language
Ezr  Rehum the chief ruler and Shimshai the scribe sent a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king
Ezr  The letter was sent by Rehum the chief ruler and Shimshai the scribe and their friends the Dinaites and the Apharsathchites the Tarpelites the Apharsites the Archevites the Babylonians the Shushanchites the Dehaites the Elamites
Ezr  And the rest of the nations which the great and noble Osnappar took over and put in Samaria and the rest of the country over the river
Ezr  This is a copy of the letter which they sent to Artaxerxes the king Your servants living across the river send these words
Ezr  We give news to the king that the Jews who came from you have come to us at Jerusalem they are building up again that uncontrolled and evil town the walls are complete and they are joining up the bases
Ezr  The king may be certain that when the building of this town and its walls is complete they will give no tax or payment in goods or forced payments and in the end it will be a cause of loss to the kings
Ezr  Now because we are responsible to the king and it is not right for us to see the kings honour damaged we have sent to give the king word of these things
Ezr  So that search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers and you will see in the book of the records that this town has been uncontrolled and a cause of trouble to kings and countries and that there were outbursts against authority there in the past for which reason the town was made waste
Ezr  We give you word that if the building of this town and its walls is made complete there will be an end of your power in the country across the river
Ezr  Then the king sent an answer to Rehum the chief ruler and Shimshai the scribe and their friends living in Samaria and to the rest of those across the river saying Peace to you
Ezr  And now the sense of the letter which you sent to us has been made clear to me
Ezr  And I gave orders for a search to be made and it is certain that in the past this town has made trouble for kings and that outbursts against authority have taken place there
Ezr  Further there have been great kings in Jerusalem ruling over all the country across the river to whom they gave taxes and payments in goods and forced payments
Ezr  Give an order now that these men are to do nothing more and that the building of the town is to be stopped till I give an order
Ezr  Be certain to do this with all care do not let trouble be increased to the kings damage
Ezr  Then after reading the kings letter Rehum and Shimshai the scribe and their friends went quickly to Jerusalem to the Jews and had them stopped by force
Ezr  So the work of the house of God at Jerusalem came to an end so it was stopped till the second year of the rule of Darius king of Persia
Ezr  Now the prophets Haggai and Zechariah the son of Iddo were preaching to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel
Ezr  Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak got up and made a start at building the house of God at Jerusalem and the prophets of God were with them helping them
Ezr  At the same time Tattenai ruler of the land across the river and Shetharbozenai and their men came to them and said Who gave you orders to go on building this house and this wall
Ezr  Then they said these words to them What are the names of the men who are at work on this building
Ezr  But the eye of their God was on the chiefs of the Jews and they did not make them give up working till the question had been put before Darius and an answer had come by letter about it
Ezr  This is a copy of the letter which Tattenai the ruler of the land across the river and Shetharbozenai and his friends the Apharsachites living across the river sent to Darius the king
Ezr  They sent him a letter saying To Darius the king all peace
Ezr  This is to give the king word that we went into the land of Judah to the house of the great God which is made of great stones and has its walls supported with wood and the work is going on with industry and they are doing it well
Ezr  Then we said to the men responsible who gave you authority for the building of this house and these walls
Ezr  And we made request for their names so that we might send you word and give you the names of the men at the head of them
Ezr  And they made answer to us saying We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth and we are building the house which was put up in times long past and was designed and made complete by a great king of Israel
Ezr  But when the God of heaven was moved to wrath by our fathers he gave them up into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon the Chaldaean who sent destruction on this house and took the people away into Babylon
Ezr  But in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon Cyrus the king gave an order for the building of this house of God
Ezr  And the gold and silver vessels of the house of God which Nebuchadnezzar took from the Temple which was in Jerusalem and put into the house of his god in Babylon these Cyrus the king took from the house of his god in Babylon and gave to one named Sheshbazzar whom he had made ruler
Ezr  And he said to him Go take these vessels and put them in the Temple in Jerusalem and let the house of God be put up again in its place
Ezr  Then this same Sheshbazzar came and put the house of God in Jerusalem on its bases and from that time till now the building has been going on but it is still not complete
Ezr  So now if it seems good to the king let search be made in the kings storehouse at Babylon to see if it is true that an order was given by Cyrus the king for the building of this house of God at Jerusalem and let the king send us word of his pleasure in connection with this business
Ezr  Then Darius the king gave an order and a search was made in the house of the records where the things of value were stored up in Babylon
Ezr  And at Achmetha in the great house of the king in the land of Media they came across a roll in which this statement was put on record
Ezr  In the first year of Cyrus the king Cyrus the king made an order In connection with the house of God at Jerusalem let the house be put up the place where they make offerings and let the earth for the bases be put in place let it be sixty cubits high and sixty cubits wide
Ezr  With three lines of great stones and one line of new wood supports and let the necessary money be given out of the kings storehouse
Ezr  And let the gold and silver vessels from the house of God which Nebuchadnezzar took from the Temple at Jerusalem to Babylon be given back and taken again to the Temple at Jerusalem every one in its place and put them in the house of God
Ezr  So now Tattenai ruler of the land across the river and Shetharbozenai and your people the Apharsachites across the river keep far from that place
Ezr  Let the work of this house of God go on let the ruler of the Jews and their responsible men put up this house of God in its place
Ezr  Further I give orders as to what you are to do for the responsible men of the Jews in connection with the building of this house of God that from the kings wealth that is from the taxes got together in the land over the river the money needed is to be given to these men readily so that their work may not be stopped
Ezr  And whatever they have need of young oxen and sheep and lambs for burned offerings to the God of heaven grain salt wine and oil whatever the priests in Jerusalem say is necessary is to be given to them day by day regularly
Ezr  So that they may make offerings of a sweet smell to the God of heaven with prayers for the life of the king and of his sons
Ezr  And I have given orders that if anyone makes any change in this word one of the supports is to be pulled out of his house and he is to be lifted up and fixed to it and his house is to be made waste for this
Ezr  And may the God who has made it a restingplace for his name send destruction on all kings and peoples whose hands are outstretched to make any change in this or to do damage to this house of God at Jerusalem I Darius have given this order let it be done with all care
Ezr  Then Tattenai the ruler across the river and Shetharbozenai and their people because of the order given by King Darius did as he had said with all care
Ezr  And the responsible men of the Jews went on with their building and did well helped by the teaching of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo They went on building till it was complete in keeping with the word of the God of Israel and the orders given by Cyrus and Darius and Artaxerxes king of Persia
Ezr  And the building of this house was complete on the third day of the month Adar in the sixth year of the rule of Darius the king
Ezr  And the children of Israel the priests and the Levites and the rest of those who had come back kept the feast of the opening of this house of God with joy
Ezr  And they gave as offerings at the opening of this house of God a hundred oxen two hundred sheep four hundred lambs and for a sinoffering for all Israel twelve hegoats being the number of the tribes of Israel
Ezr  And they put the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their order for the worship of God at Jerusalem as it is recorded in the book of Moses
Ezr  And the children of Israel who had come back kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month
Ezr  For the priests and the Levites had made themselves clean together they were all clean and they put the Passover lamb to death for all those who had come back and for their brothers the priests and for themselves
Ezr  And the children of Israel who had come back and all those who were joined to them after separating themselves from the evil ways of the people of the land to become the servants of the Lord the God of Israel took food together
Ezr  And kept the feast of unleavened bread for seven days with joy for the Lord had made them full of joy by turning the heart of the king of Assyria to them to give them help in the work of the house of God the God of Israel
Ezr  Now after these things when Artaxerxes was king of Persia Ezra the son of Seraiah the son of Azariah the son of Hilkiah
Ezr  The son of Shallum the son of Zadok the son of Ahitub
Ezr  The son of Amariah the son of Azariah the son of Meraioth
Ezr  The son of Zerahiah the son of Uzzi the son of Bukki
Ezr  The son of Abishua the son of Phinehas the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the chief priest
Ezr  This Ezra went up from Babylon and he was a scribe expert in the law of Moses which the Lord the God of Israel had given and the king moved by the Lord his God gave him whatever he made request for
Ezr  And some of the children of Israel went up with some of the priests and the Levites and the musicmakers and the doorkeepers and the Nethinim to Jerusalem in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king
Ezr  And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month in the seventh year of the kings rule
Ezr  For starting his journey from Babylon on the first day of the first month he came to Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month by the good help of his God
Ezr  For Ezra had given his mind to learning the law of the Lord and doing it and to teaching his rules and decisions in Israel
Ezr  Now this is a copy of the letter which King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest and the scribe who put into writing the words of the orders of the Lord and of his rules for Israel
Ezr  Artaxerxes king of kings to Ezra the priest scribe of the law of the God of heaven all peace
Ezr  And now it is my order that all those of the people of Israel and their priests and Levites in my kingdom who are ready and have a desire to go to Jerusalem are to go with you
Ezr  Because you are sent by the king and his seven wise men to get knowledge about Judah and Jerusalem as you are ordered by the law of your God which is in your hand
Ezr  And to take with you the silver and gold freely offered by the king and his wise men to the God of Israel whose Temple is in Jerusalem
Ezr  As well as all the silver and gold which you get from the land of Babylon together with the offering of the people and of the priests freely given for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem
Ezr  So with this money get with care oxen sheep and lambs with their meal offerings and their drink offerings to be offered on the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem
Ezr  And whatever seems right to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and gold that do as may be pleasing to your God
Ezr  And the vessels which have been given to you for the uses of the house of your God you are to give to the God of Jerusalem
Ezr  And whatever more is needed for the house of your God and which you may have to give take it from the kings storehouse
Ezr  And I even I Artaxerxes the king now give orders to all keepers of the kings money across the river that whatever Ezra the priest the scribe of the law of the God of heaven may have need of from you is to be done with all care
Ezr  Up to a hundred talents of silver a hundred measures of grain a hundred measures of wine and a hundred measures of oil and salt without measure
Ezr  Whatever is ordered by the God of heaven let it be done completely for the house of the God of heaven so that there may not be wrath against the kingdom of the king and his sons
Ezr  In addition we make it clear to you that it will be against the law to put any tax or payment in goods or forced payment on any of the priests or Levites the musicmakers doorkeepers Nethinim or any servants of this house of God
Ezr  And you Ezra by the wisdom of your God which is in you are to put rulers and judges to have authority over all the people across the river who have knowledge of the laws of your God and you are to give teaching to him who has no knowledge of them
Ezr  And if anyone does not keep the law of your God and the law of the king take care that punishment is given to him by death or by driving him from his country or by taking away his goods or by putting him in prison
Ezr  Praise be to the Lord the God of our fathers who has put such a thing into the heart of the king to make fair the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem
Ezr  And has given mercy to me before the king and his government and before all the kings great captains And I was made strong by the hand of the Lord my God which was on me and I got together out of Israel chief men to go up with me
Ezr  Now these are the heads of families who were listed of those who went up with me from Babylon when Artaxerxes was king
Ezr  Of the sons of Phinehas Gershom of the sons of Ithamar Daniel of the sons of David Hattush
Ezr  Of the sons of Shecaniah of the sons of Parosh Zechariah and with him were listed a hundred and fifty males
Ezr  Of the sons of Pahathmoab Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah and with him two hundred males
Ezr  Of the sons of Shecaniah the son of Jahaziel and with him three hundred males
Ezr  And of the sons of Adin Ebed the son of Jonathan and with him fifty males
Ezr  And of the sons of Elam Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah and with him seventy males
Ezr  And of the sons of Shephatiah Zebadiah the son of Michael and with him eighty males
Ezr  Of the sons of Joab Obadiah the son of Jehiel and with him two hundred and eighteen males
Ezr  And of the sons of Shelomith the son of Josiphiah and with him a hundred and sixty males
Ezr  And of the sons of Bebai Zechariah the son of Bebai and with him twentyeight males
Ezr  And of the sons of Azgad Johanan the son of Hakkatan and with him a hundred and ten males
Ezr  And of the sons of Adonikam the last whose names were Eliphelet Jeuel and Shemaiah and with them sixty males
Ezr  And of the sons of Bigvai Uthai and Zabbud and with them seventy males
Ezr  And I made them come together by the river flowing to Ahava and we were there in tents for three days and after viewing the people and the priests I saw that no sons of Levi were there
Ezr  Then I sent for Eliezer and Ariel and Shemaiah and Elnathan Jarib and Elnathan and Nathan and Zechariah and Meshullam all responsible men and for Joiarib and Elnathan who were wise men
Ezr  And I sent them to Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia and gave them orders what to say to Iddo and his brothers the Nethinim at the place Casiphia so that they might come back to us with men to do the work of the house of our God
Ezr  And by the help of our God they got for us Ishsechel one of the sons of Mahli the son of Levi the son of Israel and Sherebiah with his sons and brothers eighteen
Ezr  And Hashabiah and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari his brothers and their sons twenty
Ezr  And of the Nethinim to whom David and the captains had given the work of helping the Levites two hundred and twenty Nethinim all of them specially named
Ezr  Then I gave orders for a time of going without food there by the river Ahava so that we might make ourselves low before our God in prayer requesting from him a straight way for us and for our little ones and for all our substance
Ezr  For I would not for shame make request to the king for a band of armed men and horsemen to give us help against those who might make attacks on us on the way for we had said to the king The hand of our God is on his servants for good but his power and his wrath are against all those who are turned away from him
Ezr  So we went without food requesting our God for this and his ear was open to our prayer
Ezr  So I put on one side twelve of the chiefs of the priests Sherebiah Hashabiah and ten of their brothers with them
Ezr  And gave to them by weight the silver and the gold and the vessels all the offering for the house of our God which the king and his wise men and his captains and all Israel there present had given
Ezr  Measuring into their hands six hundred and fifty talents of silver and silver vessels a hundred talents weight and a hundred talents of gold
Ezr  And twenty gold basins of a thousand darics and two vessels of the best bright brass equal in value to gold
Ezr  And I said to them You are holy to the Lord and the vessels are holy and the silver and the gold are an offering freely given to the Lord the God of your fathers
Ezr  Take care of them and keep them till you put them on the scales before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites and the chiefs of the families of Israel in Jerusalem in the rooms of the house of the Lord
Ezr  So the priests and the Levites took the weight of silver and gold and the vessels to take them to Jerusalem into the house of our God
Ezr  Then we went away from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month to go to Jerusalem and the hand of our God was on us and he gave us salvation from our haters and those who were waiting to make an attack on us by the way
Ezr  And we came to Jerusalem and were there for three days
Ezr  And on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were measured out by weight in the house of our God into the hands of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas and with them were Jozabad the son of Jeshua and Noadiah the son of Binnui the Levites
Ezr  All was handed over by number and by weight and the weight was put on record at that time
Ezr  And those who had been prisoners who had come back from a strange land made burned offerings to the God of Israel twelve oxen for all Israel ninetysix male sheep seventyseven lambs twelve hegoats for a sinoffering all this was a burned offering to the Lord
Ezr  And they gave the kings orders to the kings captains and the rulers across the river and they gave the people and the house of God the help which was needed
Ezr  Now after these things were done the captains came to me and said The people of Israel and the priests and Levites have not kept themselves separate from the people of the lands but have taken part in the disgusting ways of the Canaanites the Hittites the Perizzites the Jebusites the Ammonites the Moabites the Egyptians and the Amorites
Ezr  For they have taken their daughters for themselves and for their sons so that the holy seed has been mixed with the peoples of the lands and in fact the captains and rulers have been the first to do this evil
Ezr  And hearing this with signs of grief and pulling out the hair of my head and my chin I took my seat on the earth deeply troubled
Ezr  Then everyone who went in fear of the words of the God of Israel because of the sin of those who had come back came together to me and I kept where I was overcome with grief till the evening offering
Ezr  And at the evening offering having made myself low before God I got up and with signs of grief falling down on my knees with my hands stretched out to the Lord my God
Ezr  I said O my God shame keeps me from lifting up my face to you my God for our sins are increased higher than our heads and our evildoing has come up to heaven
Ezr  From the days of our fathers till this day we have been great sinners and for our sins we and our kings and our priests have been given up into the hands of the kings of the lands to the sword and to prison and to loss of goods and to shame of face as it is this day
Ezr  And now for a little time grace has come to us from the Lord our God to let a small band of us get free and to give us a nail in his holy place so that our God may give light to our eyes and a measure of new life in our prison chains
Ezr  For we are servants but our God has not been turned away from us in our prison but has had mercy on us before the eyes of the kings of Persia to give us new strength to put up again the house of our God and to make fair its waste places and to give us a wall in Judah and Jerusalem
Ezr  And now O our God what are we to say after this for we have not kept your laws
Ezr  Which you gave to your servants the prophets saying The land into which you are going to take it for a heritage is an unclean land because of the evil lives of the peoples of the land and their disgusting ways which have made the land unclean from end to end
Ezr  So now do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons or do anything for their peace or wellbeing for ever so that you may be strong living on the good of the land and handing it on to your children for a heritage for ever
Ezr  And after everything which has come on us because of our evildoing and our great sin and seeing that the punishment which you O God have given us is less than the measure of our sins and that you have kept from death those of us who are here
Ezr  Are we again to go against your orders taking wives from among the people who do these disgusting things would you not be angry with us till our destruction was complete till there was not one who got away safe
Ezr  O Lord God of Israel righteousness is yours we are only a small band which has been kept from death as at this day see we are before you in our sin for no one may keep his place before you because of this
Ezr  Now while Ezra was making his prayer and his statement of wrongdoing weeping and falling down before the house of God a very great number of men and women and children out of Israel came together round him for the people were weeping bitterly
Ezr  And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel one of the sons of Elam answering said to Ezra We have done evil against our God and have taken as our wives strange women of the peoples of the land but still there is hope for Israel in this question
Ezr  Let us now make an agreement with our God to put away all the wives and all their children if it seems right to my lord and to those who go in fear of the words of our God and let it be done in keeping with the law
Ezr  Up now for this is your business and we are with you take heart and do it
Ezr  Then Ezra got up and made the chiefs of the priests and the Levites and all Israel take an oath that they would do this So they took an oath
Ezr  Then Ezra got up from before the house of God and went into the room of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib but when he came there he took no food or drink for he was sorrowing for the sin of those who had come back
Ezr  And they made a public statement through all Judah and Jerusalem to all those who had come back that they were to come together to Jerusalem
Ezr  And that if anyone did not come before three days were past as ordered by the rulers and the responsible men all his goods would be put under the curse and he himself would be cut off from the meeting of the people who had come back
Ezr  Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin came together to Jerusalem before three days were past it was the ninth month on the twentieth day of the month and all the people were seated in the wide square in front of the house of God shaking with fear because of this business and because of the great rain
Ezr  And Ezra the priest got to his feet and said to them You have done wrong and taken strange women for your wives so increasing the sin of Israel
Ezr  So now give praise to the Lord the God of your fathers and do his pleasure and make yourselves separate from the peoples of the land and from the strange women
Ezr  Then all the people answering said with a loud voice As you have said so it is right for us to do
Ezr  But the number of people is great and it is a time of much rain it is not possible for us to go on waiting outside and this is not a thing which may be done in one day or even two for our sin in this business is great
Ezr  So now let our rulers be representatives for all the people and let all those in our towns who are married to strange women come at fixed times and with them the responsible men and the judges of every town till the burning wrath of our God is turned away from us and this has been done
Ezr  Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah were against this Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supporting them
Ezr  So those who had come back did so And Ezra the priest with certain heads of families by their fathers families all of them by their names were marked out and on the first day of the tenth month they took their places to go into the question with care
Ezr  And they got to the end of all the men who were married to strange women by the first day of the first month
Ezr  And among the sons of the priests who were married to strange women were these of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak and his brothers Maaseiah and Eliezer and Jarib and Gedaliah
Ezr  And they gave their word that they would put away their wives and for their sin they gave an offering of a male sheep of the flock
Ezr  And of the sons of Immer Hanani and Zebadiah
Ezr  And of the sons of Harim Maaseiah and Elijah and Shemaiah and Jehiel and Uzziah
Ezr  And of the sons of Pashhur Elioenai Maaseiah Ishmael Nethanel Jozabad and Elasah
Ezr  And of the Levites Jozabad and Shimei and Kelaiah that is Kelita Pethahiah Judah and Eliezer
Ezr  And of the musicmakers Eliashib and of the doorkeepers Shallum and Telem and Uri
Ezr  And of Israel the sons of Parosh Ramiah and Izziah and Malchijah and Mijamin and Eleazar and Malchijah and Benaiah
Ezr  And of the sons of Elam Mattaniah Zechariah and Jehiel and Abdi and Jeremoth and Elijah
Ezr  And of the sons of Zattu Elioenai Eliashib Mattaniah and Jeremoth and Zabad and Aziza
Ezr  And of the sons of Bebai Jehohanan Hananiah Zabbai Athlai
Ezr  And of the sons of Bani Meshullam Malluch and Adaiah Jashub and Sheal Jeremoth
Ezr  And of the sons of Pahathmoab Adna and Chelal Benaiah Maaseiah Mattaniah Bezalel and Binnui and Manasseh
Ezr  And of the sons of Harim Eliezer Isshijah Malchijah Shemaiah Shimeon
Ezr  Benjamin Malluch Shemariah
Ezr  Of the sons of Hashum Mattenai Mattattah Zabad Eliphelet Jeremai Manasseh Shimei
Ezr  Of the sons of Bani Maadai Amram and Uel
Ezr  Benaiah Bedeiah Cheluhi
Ezr  Vaniah Meremoth Eliashib
Ezr  Mattaniah Mattenai and Jaasu
Ezr  And Bani and Binnui Shimei
Ezr  And Shelemiah and Nathan and Adaiah
Ezr  Machnadebai Shashai Sharai
Ezr  Azarel and Shelemiah Shemariah
Ezr  Shallum Amariah Joseph
Ezr  Of the sons of Nebo Jeiel Mattithiah Zabad Zebina Iddo and Joel Benaiah
Ezr  All these had taken strange wives and some of them had wives by whom they had offspring
Neh  The history of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah Now it came about in the month Chislev in the twentieth year when I was in Shushan the kings town
Neh  That Hanani one of my brothers came with certain men from Judah and in answer to my request for news of the Jews who had been prisoners and had got away and of Jerusalem
Neh  They said to me The small band of Jews now living there in the land are in great trouble and shame the wall of Jerusalem has been broken down and its doorways burned with fire
Neh  Then after hearing these words for some days I gave myself up to weeping and sorrow seated on the earth and taking no food I made prayer to the God of heaven
Neh  And said O Lord the God of heaven the great God greatly to be feared keeping faith and mercy with those who have love for him and are true to his laws
Neh  Let your ear now take note and let your eyes be open so that you may give ear to the prayer of your servant which I make before you at this time day and night for the children of Israel your servants while I put before you the sins of the children of Israel which we have done against you truly I and my fathers people are sinners
Neh  We have done great wrong against you and have not kept the orders the rules and the decisions which you gave to your servant Moses
Neh  Keep in mind O Lord the order you gave your servant Moses saying If you do wrong I will send you wandering among the peoples
Neh  But if you come back to me and keep my orders and do them even if those of you who have been forced out are living in the farthest parts of heaven I will get them from there and take them back to the place marked out by me for the restingplace of my name
Neh  Now these are your servants and your people whom you have made yours by your great power and by your strong hand
Neh  O Lord let your ear take note of the prayer of your servant and of the prayers of your servants who take delight in worshipping your name give help O Lord to your servant this day and let him have mercy in the eyes of this man Now I was the kings wineservant
Neh  And it came about in the month Nisan in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king when wine was before him that I took up the wine and gave it to the king Now I had never before been sad when the king was present
Neh  And the king said to me Why is your face sad seeing that you are not ill this is nothing but sorrow of heart Then I was full of fear
Neh  And said to the king May the king be living for ever is it not natural for my face to be sad when the town the place where the bodies of my fathers are at rest has been made waste and its doorways burned with fire
Neh  Then the king said to me What is your desire So I made prayer to the God of heaven
Neh  And I said to the king If it is the kings pleasure and if your servant has your approval send me to Judah to the town where the bodies of my fathers are at rest so that I may take in hand the building of it
Neh  And the king said to me the queen being seated by his side How long will your journey take and when will you come back So the king was pleased to send me and I gave him a fixed time
Neh  Further I said to the king If it is the kings pleasure let letters be given to me for the rulers across the river so that they may let me go through till I come to Judah
Neh  And a letter to Asaph the keeper of the kings park so that he may give me wood to make boards for the doors of the tower of the house and for the wall of the town and for the house which is to be mine And the king gave me this for the hand of my God was on me
Neh  Then I came to the rulers of the lands across the river and gave them the kings letters Now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen
Neh  And Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the servant the Ammonite hearing of it were greatly troubled because a man had come to the help of the children of Israel
Neh  So I came to Jerusalem and was there three days
Neh  And in the night I got up taking with me a small band of men I said nothing to any man of what God had put into my heart to do for Jerusalem and I had no beast with me but the one on which I was seated
Neh  And I went out by night through the doorway of the valley and past the dragons waterspring as far as the place where waste material was put viewing the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and the doorways which had been burned with fire
Neh  Then I went on to the door of the fountain and to the kings pool but there was no room for my beast to get through
Neh  Then in the night I went up by the stream viewing the wall then turning back I went in by the door in the valley and so came back
Neh  And the chiefs had no knowledge of where I had been or what I was doing and I had not then said anything to the Jews or to the priests or the great ones or the chiefs or the rest of those who were doing the work
Neh  Then I said to them You see what a bad condition we are in how Jerusalem is a waste and its doorways burned with fire come let us get to work building up the wall of Jerusalem so that we may no longer be put to shame
Neh  Then I gave them an account of how the hand of my God was on me helping me and of the kings words which he had said to me And they said Let us get to work on the building So they made their hands strong for the good work
Neh  But Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the servant the Ammonite and Geshem the Arabian hearing of it made sport of us laughing at us and saying What are you doing will you go against the king
Neh  Then answering them I said The God of heaven he will be our help so we his servants will go on with our building but you have no part or right or any name in Jerusalem
Neh  Then Eliashib the chief priest got up with his brothers the priests and took in hand the building of the sheep doorway they made it holy and put its doors in position as far as the tower of Hammeah they made it holy even to the tower of Hananel
Neh  And by his side the men of Jericho were building And after them Zaccur the son of Imri
Neh  The sons of Hassenaah were the builders of the fish doorway they put its boards in place and put up its doors with their locks and rods
Neh  By their side Meremoth the son of Uriah the son of Hakkoz was making good the walls Then Meshullam the son of Berechiah the son of Meshezabel and by him Zadok the son of Baana
Neh  Near them the Tekoites were at work but their chiefs did not put their necks to the work of their Lord
Neh  Joiada the son of Paseah and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah made good the old doorway they put its boards in place and put up its doors with their locks and rods
Neh  By their side were working Melatiah the Gibeonite and Jadon the Meronothite the men of Gibeon and of Mizpah from the seat of the ruler across the river
Neh  Near them was working Uzziel the son of Harhaiah the goldworker And by him was Hananiah one of the perfumemakers building up Jerusalem as far as the wide wall
Neh  Near them was working Rephaiah the son of Hur the ruler of half Jerusalem
Neh  By his side was Jedaiah the son of Harumaph opposite his house And by him was Hattush the son of Hashabneiah
Neh  Malchijah the son of Harim and Hasshub the son of Pahathmoab were working on another part and the tower of the ovens
Neh  Near them was Shallum the son of Hallohesh the ruler of half Jerusalem with his daughters
Neh  Hanun and the people of Zanoah were working on the doorway of the valley they put it up and put up its doors with their locks and rods and a thousand cubits of wall as far as the doorway where the waste material was placed
Neh  And Malchijah the son of Rechab the ruler of the division of Bethhaccherem made good the doorway of the waste building it up and putting up its doors with their locks and rods
Neh  And Shallun the son of Colhozeh the ruler of the division of Mizpah made good the doorway of the fountain building it up and covering it and putting up its doors with their locks and rods with the wall of the pool of Shelah by the kings garden as far as the steps which go down from the town of David
Neh  By his side was working Nehemiah the son of Azbuk ruler of half the division of Bethzur as far as the place opposite the last restingplaces of Davids family and the pool which was made and the house of the men of war
Neh  Then came the Levites Rehum the son of Bani By his side was working Hashabiah ruler of half the division of Keilah for his division
Neh  After him were working their brothers Bavvai the son of Henadad ruler of half the division of Keilah
Neh  And by his side was working Ezer the son of Jeshua the ruler of Mizpah making good another part opposite the way up to the store of arms at the turning of the wall
Neh  After him Baruch the son of Zabbai was hard at work on another part from the turning of the wall to the door of the house of Eliashib the chief priest
Neh  After him Meremoth the son of Uriah the son of Hakkoz was working on another part from the door of the house of Eliashib as far as the end of his house
Neh  After him were working the priests the men of the lowland
Neh  After them came Benjamin and Hasshub opposite their house After them Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ananiah made good the wall by the house where he himself was living
Neh  After him Binnui the son of Henadad was working on another part from the house of Azariah as far as the turning of the wall and the angle
Neh  Palal the son of Uzai made good the wall opposite the angle and the tower which comes out from the higher part of the kings house by the open space of the watch After him was Pedaiah the son of Parosh
Neh  Now the Nethinim were living in the Ophel as far as the place facing the water doorway to the east and the tower which comes out
Neh  After him the Tekoites were making good another part opposite the great tower which comes out and up to the wall of the Ophel
Neh  Further on past the horse doorway the priests were at work every one opposite his house
Neh  After them Zadok the son of Immer was working opposite his house And after him Shemaiah the son of Shecaniah the keeper of the east door
Neh  After him Hananiah the son of Shelemiah and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph were making good another part After him Meshullam the son of Berechiah made good the wall opposite his room
Neh  After him Malchijah one of the goldworkers to the Nethinim and the traders made good the wall opposite the doorway of Hammiphkad and as far as the way up to the angle
Neh  And between the way up to the angle and the sheep door the goldworkers and the traders made good the wall
Neh  Now Sanballat hearing that we were building the wall was very angry and in his wrath made sport of the Jews
Neh  And in the hearing of his countrymen and the army of Samaria he said What are these feeble Jews doing will they make themselves strong will they make offerings will they get the work done in a day will they make the stones which have been burned come again out of the dust
Neh  Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him and he said Such is their building that if a fox goes up it their stone wall will be broken down
Neh  Give ear O our God for we are looked down on let their words of shame be turned back on themselves and let them be given up to wasting in a land where they are prisoners
Neh  Let not their wrongdoing be covered or their sin washed away from before you for they have made you angry before the builders
Neh  So we went on building the wall and all the wall was joined together halfway up for the people were working hard
Neh  But when it came to the ears of Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabians and the Ammonites and the Ashdodites that the building of the walls of Jerusalem was going forward and the broken places were being made good they were full of wrath
Neh  And they made designs all of them together to come and make an attack on Jerusalem causing trouble there
Neh  But we made our prayer to God and had men on watch against them day and night because of them
Neh  And Judah said The strength of the workmen is giving way and there is much waste material it is impossible for us to put up the wall
Neh  And those who were against us said Without their knowledge and without their seeing us we will come among them and put them to death causing the work to come to a stop
Neh  And it came about that when the Jews who were living near them came they said to us ten times From all directions they are coming against us
Neh  So in the lowest part of the space at the back of the walls in the open places I put the people by families with their swords their spears and their bows
Neh  And after looking I got up and said to the great ones and to the chiefs and to the rest of the people Have no fear of them keep in mind the Lord who is great and greatly to be feared and take up arms for your brothers your sons and your daughters your wives and your houses
Neh  And when it came to the ears of those who were against us that we had knowledge of their designs and that God had made their purpose come to nothing we all went back to the wall everyone to his work
Neh  And from that time half of my servants were doing their part of the work and half kept the spears and bodycovers and the bows and the metal wardresses and the chiefs were at the back of the men of Judah
Neh  Those who were building the wall and those who were moving material did their part everyone working with one hand with his spear in the other
Neh  Every builder was working with his sword at his side And by my side was a man for sounding the horn
Neh  And I said to the great ones and the chiefs and the rest of the people The work is great and widely spaced and we are far away from one another on the wall
Neh  Wherever you may be when the horn is sounded come here to us our God will be fighting for us
Neh  So we went on with the work and half of them had spears in their hands from the dawn of the morning till the stars were seen
Neh  And at the same time I said to the people Let everyone with his servant come inside Jerusalem for the night so that at night they may keep watch for us and go on working by day
Neh  So not one of us I or my brothers or my servants or the watchmen who were with me took off his clothing everyone went armed to the water
Neh  Then there was a great outcry from the people and their wives against their countrymen the Jews
Neh  For there were some who said We our sons and our daughters are a great number let us get grain so that we may have food for our needs
Neh  And there were some who said We are giving our fields and our vinegardens and our houses for debt let us get grain because we are in need
Neh  And there were others who said We have given up our fields and our vinegardens to get money for the kings taxes
Neh  But our flesh is the same as the flesh of our countrymen and our children as their children and now we are giving our sons and daughters into the hands of others to be their servants and some of our daughters are servants even now and we have no power to put a stop to it for other men have our fields and our vinegardens
Neh  And on hearing their outcry and what they said I was very angry
Neh  And after turning it over in my mind I made a protest to the chiefs and the rulers and said to them Every one of you is taking interest from his countryman And I got together a great meeting of protest
Neh  And I said to them We have given whatever we were able to give to make our brothers the Jews free who were servants and prisoners of the nations and would you now give up your brothers for a price and are they to become our property Then they said nothing answering not a word
Neh  And I said What you are doing is not good is it not the more necessary for you to go in the fear of our God because of the shame which the nations may put on us
Neh  Even I and my servants have been taking interest for the money and the grain we have let them have So now let us give up this thing
Neh  Give back to them this very day their fields their vinegardens their olivegardens and their houses as well as a hundredth part of the money and the grain and the wine and the oil which you have taken from them
Neh  Then they said We will give them back and take nothing for them we will do as you say Then I sent for the priests and made them take an oath that they would keep this agreement
Neh  And shaking out the folds of my robe I said So may God send out from his house and his work every man who does not keep this agreement even so let him be sent out and made as nothing And all the meeting of the people said So be it and gave praise to the Lord And the people did as they had said
Neh  Now from the time when I was made ruler of the people in the land of Judah from the twentieth year till the thirtysecond year of Artaxerxes the king for twelve years I and my servants have never taken the food which was the right of the ruler
Neh  But earlier rulers who were before me made the people responsible for their upkeep and took from them bread and wine at the rate of forty shekels of silver and even their servants were lords over the people but I did not do so because of the fear of God
Neh  And I kept on with the work of this wall and we got no land for ourselves and all my servants were helping with the work
Neh  And more than this a hundred and fifty of the Jews and the rulers were guests at my table in addition to those who came to us from the nations round about us
Neh  Now the food made ready for one day was one ox and six fat sheep as well as fowls and once in ten days a store of all sorts of wine but all the same I did not take the food to which the ruler had a right because the people were crushed under a hard yoke
Neh  Keep in mind O my God for my good all I have done for this people
Neh  Now when word was given to Sanballat and Tobiah and to Geshem the Arabian and to the rest of our haters that I had done the building of the wall and that there were no more broken places in it though even then I had not put up the doors in the doorways
Neh  Sanballat and Geshem sent to me saying Come let us have a meeting in one of the little towns in the lowland of Ono But their purpose was to do me evil
Neh  And I sent men to them saying I am doing a great work so that it is not possible for me to come down is the work to be stopped while I go away from it and come down to you
Neh  And four times they sent to me in this way and I sent them the same answer
Neh  Then Sanballat sent his servant to me a fifth time with an open letter in his hand
Neh  And in it these words were recorded It is said among the nations and Geshem says so that you and the Jews are hoping to make yourselves free from the kings authority and that this is why you are building the wall and they say that it is your purpose to be their king
Neh  And that you have prophets preaching about you in Jerusalem and saying There is a king in Judah now an account of these things will be sent to the king So come now and let us have a discussion
Neh  Then I sent to him saying No such things as you say are being done they are only a fiction you have made up yourself
Neh  For they were hoping to put fear in us saying Their hands will become feeble and give up the work so that it may not get done But now O God make my hands strong
Neh  And I went to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel who was shut up and he said Let us have a meeting in the house of God inside the Temple and let the doors be shut for they will come to put you to death truly in the night they will come to put you to death
Neh  And I said Am I the sort of man to go in flight what man in my position would go into the Temple to keep himself safe I will not go in
Neh  Then it became clear to me that God had not sent him he had given this word of a prophet against me himself and Tobiah and Sanballat had given him money to do so
Neh  For this reason they had given him money in order that I might be overcome by fear and do what he said and do wrong and so they would have reason to say evil about me and put shame on me
Neh  Keep in mind O my God Tobiah and Sanballat and what they did and Noadiah the woman prophet and the rest of the prophets whose purpose was to put fear into me
Neh  So the wall was complete on the twentyfifth day of the month Elul in fiftytwo days
Neh  And when our haters had news of this all the nations round about us were full of fear and were greatly shamed for they saw that this work had been done by our God
Neh  And further in those days the chiefs of Judah sent a number of letters to Tobiah and his letters came to them
Neh  For in Judah there were a number of people who had made an agreement by oath with him because he was the soninlaw of Shecaniah the son of Arah and his son Jehohanan had taken as his wife the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah
Neh  And they said much before me of the good he had done and gave him accounts of my words And Tobiah sent letters with the purpose of causing me fear
Neh  Now when the building of the wall was complete and I had put up the doors and the doorkeepers and the musicmakers and the Levites had been given their places
Neh  I made my brother Hanani and Hananiah the ruler of the tower responsible for the government of Jerusalem for he was a man of good faith fearing God more than most
Neh  And I said to them Do not let the doors of Jerusalem be open till the sun is high and while the watchmen are in their places let the doors be shut and locked and let the people of Jerusalem be put on watch every one in his watch opposite his house
Neh  Now the town was wide and great but the people in it were only a small number and the houses had not been put up
Neh  And my God put it into my heart to get together the rulers and the chiefs and the people so that they might be listed by families And I came across a record of the names of those who came up at the first and in it I saw these words
Neh  These are the people of the divisions of the kingdom among those who had been made prisoners by Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon and taken away by him who went back to Jerusalem and Judah every one to his town

Neh  The children of Shephatiah the children of Hattil the children of Pocherethhazzebaim the children of Amon
Neh  All the Nethinim and the children of Solomons servants were three hundred and ninetytwo
Neh  All these were the people who went up from Telmelah Telharsha Cherub Addon and Immer but because they had no knowledge of their fathers families or offspring it was not certain if they were Israelites
Neh  The children of Delaiah the children of Tobiah the children of Nekoda six hundred and fortytwo
Neh  And of the priests the children of Hobaiah the children of Hakkoz the children of Barzillai who was married to one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite and took their name
Neh  They made search for their record among the lists of families but their names were nowhere to be seen so they were looked on as unclean and no longer priests
Neh  And the Tirshatha said that they were not to have the most holy things for their food till a priest came to give decision by the Urim and Thummim
Neh  The number of all the people together was fortytwo thousand three hundred and sixty
Neh  As well as their menservants and their womenservants of whom there were seven thousand three hundred and thirtyseven and they had two hundred and fortyfive men and women to make music
Neh  They had seven hundred and thirtysix horses two hundred and fortyfive transport beasts
Neh  Four hundred and thirtyfive camels six thousand seven hundred and twenty asses
Neh  And some of the heads of families gave money for the work The Tirshatha gave into the store a thousand darics of gold fifty basins five hundred and thirty priests robes
Neh  And some of the heads of families gave into the store for the work twenty thousand darics of gold and two thousand two hundred pounds of silver
Neh  And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold and two thousand pounds of silver and sixtyseven priests robes
Neh  So the priests and the Levites and the doorkeepers and the musicmakers and some of the people and the Nethinim and all Israel were living in their towns
Neh  And when the seventh month came the children of Israel were in their towns And all the people came together like one man into the wide place in front of the waterdoorway and they made a request to Ezra the scribe that he would put before them the book of the law of Moses which the Lord had given to Israel
Neh  And Ezra the priest put the law before the meeting of the people before the men and women and all those who were able to take it in on the first day of the seventh month
Neh  He was reading it in the wide place in front of the waterdoorway from early morning till the middle of the day in the hearing of all those men and women whose minds were able to take it in and the ears of all the people were open to the book of the law
Neh  And Ezra the scribe took his place on a tower of wood which they had made for the purpose and by his side were placed Mattithiah and Shema and Anaiah and Uriah and Hilkiah and Maaseiah on the right and on the left Pedaiah and Mishael and Malchijah and Hashum and Hashbaddanah Zechariah and Meshullam
Neh  And Ezra took the book opening it before the eyes of all the people for he was higher than the people and when it was open all the people got to their feet
Neh  And Ezra gave praise to the Lord the great God And all the people in answer said So be it so be it lifting up their hands and with bent heads they gave worship to the Lord going down on their faces to the earth
Neh  And Jeshua and Bani and Sherebiah and Jamin Akkub Shabbethai Hodiah Maaseiah Kelita Azariah Jozabad Hanan Pelaiah and the Levites made the law clear to the people and the people kept in their places
Neh  And they gave out the words of the book the law of God clearly and gave the sense of it so that their minds were able to take it in
Neh  And Nehemiah who was the Tirshatha and Ezra the priest and scribe and the Levites who were the teachers of the people said to all the people This day is holy to the Lord your God let there be no sorrow or weeping for all the people were weeping on hearing the words of the law
Neh  Then he said to them Go away now and take the fat for your food and the sweet for your drink and send some to him for whom nothing is made ready for this day is holy to our Lord and let there be no grief in your hearts for the joy of the Lord is your strong place
Neh  So the Levites made all the people quiet saying Be quiet for the day is holy and do not give way to grief
Neh  And all the people went away to take food and drink and to send food to others and to be glad because the words which were said to them had been made clear
Neh  And on the second day the heads of families of all the people and the priests and the Levites came together to Ezra the scribe to give attention to the words of the law
Neh  And they saw that it was recorded in the law that the Lord had given orders by Moses that the children of Israel were to have tents for their livingplaces in the feast of the seventh month
Neh  And that they were to give out an order and make it public in all their towns and in Jerusalem saying Go out to the mountain and get olive branches and branches of field olives and of myrtle and palm branches and branches of thick trees to make tents as it says in the book
Neh  And the people went out and got them and made themselves tents every one on the roof of his house and in the open spaces and in the open squares of the house of God and in the wide place of the waterdoorway and the wide place of the doorway of Ephraim
Neh  All the people who had been prisoners and had come back made tents and were living in them for from the time of Jeshua the son of Nun till that day the children of Israel had not done so And there was very great joy
Neh  And day by day from the first day till the last he was reading from the book of the law of God And they kept the feast for seven days and on the eighth day there was a holy meeting as it is ordered in the law
Neh  Now on the twentyfourth day of this month the children of Israel came together taking no food and putting haircloth and dust on their bodies
Neh  And the seed of Israel made themselves separate from all the men of other nations publicly requesting forgiveness for their sins and the wrongdoing of their fathers
Neh  And for a fourth part of the day upright in their places they were reading from the book of the law of their God and for a fourth part of the day they were requesting forgiveness and worshipping the Lord their God
Neh  Then Jeshua and Bani Kadmiel Shebaniah Bunni Sherebiah Bani and Chenani took their places on the steps of the Levites crying in a loud voice to the Lord their God
Neh  Then the Levites Jeshua and Kadmiel Bani Hashabneiah Sherebiah Hodiah Shebaniah and Pethahiah said Get up and give praise to the Lord your God for ever and ever Praise be to your great name which is lifted up high over all blessing and praise
Neh  You are the Lord even you only you have made heaven the heaven of heavens with all their armies the earth and all things in it the seas and everything in them and you keep them from destruction and the armies of heaven are your worshippers
Neh  You are the Lord the God who took Abram and made him yours guiding him from Ur of the Chaldees and gave him the name of Abraham
Neh  You saw that his heart was true to you and made an agreement with him to give the land of the Canaanite the Hittite the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Jebusite and the Girgashite even to give it to his seed and you have done what you said for righteousness is yours
Neh  And you saw the trouble of our fathers in Egypt and their cry came to your ears by the Red Sea
Neh  And you did signs and wonders on Pharaoh and all his servants and all the people of his land for you saw how cruel they were to them So you got yourself a name as it is today
Neh  By you the sea was parted before them so that they went through the sea on dry land and those who went after them went down into the deep like a stone into great waters
Neh  And you went before them by day in a pillar of cloud and in a pillar of fire by night to give them light on the way they were to go
Neh  And you came down on Mount Sinai and your voice came to them from heaven giving them right decisions and true laws good rules and orders
Neh  And you gave them word of your holy Sabbath and gave them orders and rules and a law by the hand of Moses your servant
Neh  And you gave them bread from heaven when they were in need and made water come out of the rock for their drink and gave them orders to go in and take for their heritage the land which your hand had been lifted up to give them
Neh  But they and our fathers in their pride made their necks stiff and gave no attention to your orders
Neh  And would not do them and gave no thought to the wonders you had done among them but made their necks stiff and turning away from you made a captain over themselves to take them back to their prison in Egypt but you are a God of forgiveness full of grace and pity slow to wrath and great in mercy and you did not give them up
Neh  Even when they had made for themselves an ox of metal and said This is your God who took you up out of Egypt and had done so much to make you angry
Neh  Even then in your great mercy you did not give them up in the waste land the pillar of cloud still went before them by day guiding them on their way and the pillar of fire by night to give them light and make clear the way they were to go
Neh  And you gave your good spirit to be their teacher and did not keep back your manna from their mouths and gave them water when they had need of it
Neh  Truly for forty years you were their support in the waste land and they were in need of nothing their clothing did not get old or their feet become tired
Neh  And you gave them kingdoms and peoples making distribution to them in every part of the land so they took for their heritage the land of Sihon even the land of the king of Heshbon and the land of Og king of Bashan
Neh  And you made their children as great in number as the stars of heaven and took them into the land of which you had said to their fathers that they were to go in and take it for themselves
Neh  So the children went in and took the land and you overcame before them the people of the land the Canaanites and gave them up into their hands with their kings and the people of the land so that they might do with them whatever it was their pleasure to do
Neh  And they took walled towns and a fat land and became the owners of houses full of all good things waterholes cut in the rock vinegardens and olivegardens and a wealth of fruittrees so they had food enough and became fat and had joy in the good you gave them
Neh  But they were hardhearted and went against your authority turning their backs on your law and putting to death your prophets who gave witness against them with the purpose of turning them back again to you and they did much to make you angry
Neh  And so you gave them up into the hands of their haters who were cruel to them and in the time of their trouble when they made their prayer to you you gave ear to them from heaven and in your great mercy gave them saviours who made them free from the hands of their haters
Neh  But when they had rest they did evil again before you so you gave them into the hands of their haters who had rule over them but when they came back and made their prayer to you you gave ear to them from heaven again and again in your mercy you gave them salvation
Neh  And gave witness against them so that you might make them come back again to your law but their hearts were lifted up and they gave no attention to your orders and went against your decisions which if a man keeps them will be life to him and turning their backs on you made their necks stiff and did not give ear
Neh  Year after year you put up with them and gave witness against them by your spirit through your prophets still they did not give ear and so you gave them up into the hands of the peoples of the lands
Neh  Even then in your great mercy you did not put an end to them completely or give them up for you are a God of grace and mercy
Neh  And now our God the great the strong the God who is to be feared who keeps faith and mercy let not all this trouble seem small to you which has come on us and on our kings and our rulers and on our priests and our prophets and our fathers and on all your people from the time of the kings of Assyria till this day
Neh  But still you have been in the right in everything which has come on us you have been true to us but we have done evil
Neh  And our kings our rulers our priests and our fathers have not kept your law or given attention to your orders and your witness with which you gave witness against them
Neh  For they have not been your servants in their kingdom and in all the good things you gave them and in the great and fat land you gave them and they have not been turned away from their evildoing
Neh  Now today we are servants and as for the land which you gave to our fathers so that the produce of it and the good might be theirs see we are servants in it
Neh  And it gives much increase to the kings whom you have put over us because of our sins and they have power over our bodies and over our cattle at their pleasure and we are in great trouble
Neh  And because of all this we are making an agreement in good faith and putting it in writing and our rulers our Levites and our priests are putting their names to it

Neh  They were united with their brothers their rulers and put themselves under a curse and an oath to keep their steps in the way of Gods law which was given by Moses the servant of God and to keep and do all the orders of the Lord our Lord and his decisions and his rules
Neh  And that we would not give our daughters to the peoples of the lands or take their daughters for our sons
Neh  And if the peoples of the lands come to do trade in goods or food on the Sabbath day that we would do no trade with them on the Sabbath or on a holy day and that in the seventh year we would take no payment from any debtor
Neh  And we made rules for ourselves taxing ourselves a third of a shekel every year for the upkeep of the house of our God
Neh  For the holy bread and for the regular meal offering and the regular burned offering on the Sabbaths and at the new moon and the fixed feasts and for the sinofferings to take away the sin of Israel and for all the work of the house of our God
Neh  And we the priests and the Levites and the people made selection by the decision of the Lord of those who were to take the wood offering into the house of God by families at the regular times year by year to be burned on the altar of the Lord our God as it is recorded in the law
Neh  And to take the firstfruits of our land and the firstfruits of every sort of tree year by year into the house of the Lord
Neh  As well as the first of our sons and of our cattle as it is recorded in the law and the first lambs of our herds and of our flocks which are to be taken to the house of our God to the priests who are servants in the house of our God
Neh  And that we would take the first of our rough meal and our lifted offerings and the fruit of every sort of tree and wine and oil to the priests to the rooms of the house of our God and the tenth of the produce of our land to the Levites for they the Levites take a tenth in all the towns of our ploughed land
Neh  And the priest the son of Aaron is to be with the Levites when the Levites take the tenths and the Levites are to take a tenth of the tenths into the house of our God to the rooms into the storehouse
Neh  For the children of Israel and the children of Levi are to take the lifted offering of the grain and wine and oil into the rooms where the vessels of the holy place are together with the priests and the doorkeepers and the makers of music and we will not give up caring for the house of our God
Neh  And the rulers of the people were living in Jerusalem the rest of the people made selection by the decision of chance of one out of every ten to be living in Jerusalem the holy town the other nine to go to the other towns

Neh  And of Joiarib Mattenai of Jedaiah Uzzi

Neh  Of Hilkiah Hashabiah of Jedaiah Nethanel
Neh  The Levites in the days of Eliashib Joiada and Johanan and Jaddua were listed as heads of families and the priests when Darius the Persian was king
Neh  The sons of Levi heads of families were recorded in the book of the histories even till the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib
Neh  And the chiefs of the Levites Hashabiah Sherebiah and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel with their brothers opposite them to give blessing and praise as ordered by David the man of God watch against watch
Neh  Mattaniah and Bakbukiah Obadiah Meshullam Talmon Akkub were doorkeepers keeping the watch at the storehouses of the doors
Neh  These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua the son of Jozadak and in the days of Nehemiah the ruler and of Ezra the priest the scribe
Neh  And when the time came for the wall of Jerusalem to be made holy they sent for the Levites out of all their places to come to Jerusalem to keep the feast with joy and with praise and melody with brass and corded instruments of music
Neh  And the sons of the musicmakers came together from the lowland round about Jerusalem and from the daughtertowns of the Netophathites
Neh  And from Bethgilgal and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth for the musicmakers had made daughtertowns for themselves round about Jerusalem
Neh  And the priests and the Levites made themselves clean and they made the people clean and the doorways and the wall
Neh  Then I made the rulers of Judah come up on the wall and I put in position two great bands of them who gave praise walking in ordered lines one went to the right on the wall in the direction of the doorway where the waste was put
Neh  And after them went Hoshaiah and half of the rulers of Judah
Neh  And Azariah Ezra and Meshullam
Neh  Judah and Benjamin and Shemaiah and Jeremiah
Neh  And certain of the priests sons with wind instruments Zechariah the son of Jonathan the son of Shemaiah the son of Mattaniah the son of Micaiah the son of Zaccur the son of Asaph
Neh  And his brothers Shemaiah and Azarel Milalai Gilalai Maai Nethanel and Judah Hanani with the musicinstruments of David the man of God and Ezra the scribe was at their head
Neh  And by the doorway of the fountain and straight in front of them they went up by the steps of the town of David at the slope up of the wall over the house of David as far as the waterdoorway to the east
Neh  And the other band of those who gave praise went to the left and I went after them with half the people on the wall over the tower of the ovens as far as the wide wall
Neh  And over the doorway of Ephraim and by the old door and the fish door and the tower of Hananel and the tower of Hammeah as far as the sheep door and at the doorway of the watchmen they came to a stop
Neh  So the two bands of those who gave praise took up their positions in the house of God and I and half of the chiefs with me
Neh  And the priests Eliakim Maaseiah Miniamin Micaiah Elioenai Zechariah and Hananiah with wind instruments
Neh  And Maaseiah and Shemaiah and Eleazar and Uzzi and Jehohanan and Malchijah and Elam and Ezer And the makers of melody made their voices loud with Jezrahiah their overseer
Neh  And on that day they made great offerings and were glad for God had made them glad with great joy and the women and the children were glad with them so that the joy of Jerusalem came to the ears of those who were far off
Neh  And on that day certain men were put over the rooms where the things which had been given were stored for the lifted offerings and the firstfruits and the tenths and to take into them the amounts from the fields of every town fixed by the law for the priests and the Levites for Judah was glad on account of the priests and the Levites who were in their places
Neh  And they kept the watch of their God and were responsible for making things clean and so did the musicmakers and the doorkeepers as it was ordered by David and Solomon his son
Neh  For in the days of David and Asaph in the past there was a master of the music and songs of blessing and praise to God
Neh  And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah gave what was needed by the musicmakers and the doorkeepers day by day and they made the offerings holy for the Levites and the Levites did the same for the sons of Aaron
Neh  On that day there was a reading from the book of Moses in the hearing of the people and they saw that it said in the book that no Ammonite or Moabite might ever come into the meeting of God
Neh  Because they did not give the children of Israel bread and water when they came to them but got Balaam to put a curse on them though the curse was turned into a blessing by our God
Neh  So after hearing the law they took out of Israel all the mixed people
Neh  Now before this Eliashib the priest who had been placed over the rooms of the house of our God being a friend of Tobiah
Neh  Had made ready for him a great room where at one time they kept the meal offerings the perfume and the vessels and the tenths of the grain and wine and oil which were given by order to the Levites and the musicmakers and the doorkeepers and the lifted offerings for the priests
Neh  But all this time I was not at Jerusalem for in the thirtysecond year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went to the king and after some days I got the king to let me go
Neh  And I came to Jerusalem and it was clear to me what evil Eliashib had done for Tobiah in making ready for him a room in the buildings of the house of God
Neh  And it was evil in my eyes so I had all Tobiahs things put out of the room
Neh  Then I gave orders and they made the rooms clean and I put back in them the vessels of the house of God with the meal offerings and the perfume
Neh  And I saw that the Levites had not been given what was needed for their support so that the Levites and the musicmakers who did the work had gone away everyone to his field
Neh  Then I made protests to the chiefs and said Why has the house of God been given up And I got them together and put them in their places
Neh  Then all Judah came with the tenth part of the grain and wine and oil and put it into the storehouses
Neh  And I made controllers over the storehouses Shelemiah the priest and Zadok the scribe and of the Levites Pedaiah and with them was Hanan the son of Zaccur the son of Mattaniah they were taken to be true men and their business was the distribution of these things to their brothers
Neh  Keep me in mind O my God in connection with this and do not let the good which I have done for the house of my God and its worship go from your memory completely
Neh  In those days I saw in Judah some who were crushing grapes on the Sabbath and getting in grain and putting it on asses as well as wine and grapes and figs and all sorts of goods which they took into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day and I gave witness against them on the day when they were marketing food
Neh  And there were men of Tyre there who came with fish and all sorts of goods trading with the children of Judah and in Jerusalem on the Sabbath
Neh  Then I made protests to the chiefs of Judah and said to them What is this evil which you are doing not keeping the Sabbath day holy
Neh  Did not your fathers do the same and did not our God send all this evil on us and on this town but you are causing more wrath to come on Israel by not keeping the Sabbath holy
Neh  And so when the streets of Jerusalem were getting dark before the Sabbath I gave orders for the doors to be shut and not to be open again till after the Sabbath and I put some of my servants by the door so that nothing might be taken in on the Sabbath day
Neh  So the traders in all sorts of goods took their nights rest outside Jerusalem once or twice
Neh  Then I gave witness against them and said Why are you waiting all night by the wall if you do so again I will have you taken prisoners From that time they did not come again on the Sabbath
Neh  And I gave the Levites orders to make themselves clean and come and keep the doors and make the Sabbath holy Keep this in mind to my credit O my God and have mercy on me for great is your mercy
Neh  And in those days I saw the Jews who were married to women of Ashdod and Ammon and Moab
Neh  And their children were talking half in the language of Ashdod they had no knowledge of the Jews language but made use of the language of the two peoples
Neh  And I took up the cause against them cursing them and giving blows to some of them and pulling out their hair and I made them take an oath by God saying You are not to give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves
Neh  Was it not in these things that Solomon king of Israel did wrong among a number of nations there was no king like him and he was dear to his God and God made him king over all Israel but even he was made to do evil by strange women
Neh  Are we then without protest to let you do all this great evil sinning against our God by taking strange women for your wives
Neh  And one of the sons of Joiada the son of Eliashib the chief priest was soninlaw to Sanballat the Horonite so I sent him away from me
Neh  Keep them in mind O my God because they have put shame on the priests name and on the agreement of the priests and the Levites
Neh  So I made them clean from all strange people and had regular watches fixed for the priests and for the Levites everyone in his work
Neh  And for the wood offering at fixed times and for the first fruits Keep me in mind O my God for good
Est  Now it came about in the days of Ahasuerus that Ahasuerus who was ruler of a hundred and twentyseven divisions of the kingdom from India as far as Ethiopia
Est  That in those days when King Ahasuerus was ruling in Shushan his strong town
Est  In the third year of his rule he gave a feast to all his captains and his servants and the captains of the army of Persia and Media the great men and the rulers of the divisions of his kingdom were present before him
Est  And for a long time even a hundred and eighty days he let them see all the wealth and the glory of his kingdom and the great power and honour which were his
Est  And at the end of that time the king gave a feast for all the people who were present in Shushan the kings town small as well as great for seven days in the outer square of the garden of the kings house
Est  There were fair hangings of white and green and blue fixed with cords of purple and the best linen to silver rings and pillars of polished stone the seats were of gold and silver on a floor of red and white and yellow and black stone
Est  And they gave them drink in gold vessels every vessel being different and wine of the kingdom freely given by the king
Est  And the drinking was in keeping with the law no one was forced for the king had given orders to all the chief servants of his house to do as was pleasing to every man
Est  And Vashti the queen gave a feast for the women in the house of King Ahasuerus
Est  On the seventh day when the heart of the king was glad with wine he gave orders to Mehuman Biztha Harbona Bigtha and Abagtha Zethar and Carcas the seven unsexed servants who were waiting before Ahasuerus the king
Est  That Vashti the queen was to come before him crowned with her crown and let the people and the captains see her for she was very beautiful
Est  But when the servants gave her the kings order Vashti the queen said she would not come then the king was very angry and his heart was burning with wrath
Est  And the king said to the wise men who had knowledge of the times for this was the kings way with all who were expert in law and in the giving of decisions
Est  And second only to him were Carshena Shethar Admatha Tarshish Meres Marsena and Memucan the seven rulers of Persia and Media who were friends of the king and had the first places in the kingdom
Est  What is to be done by law to Vashti the queen because she has not done what King Ahasuerus by his servants gave her orders to do
Est  And before the king and the captains Memucan gave his answer Vashti the queen has done wrong not only to the king but to all the captains and to all the peoples in all the divisions of the kingdom of King Ahasuerus
Est  For news of what the queen has done will come to the ears of all women and they will no longer give respect to their husbands when it is said to them King Ahasuerus gave orders for Vashti the queen to come before him and she came not
Est  And the wives of the captains of Persia and Media hearing what the queen has done will say the same to all the kings captains So there will be much shame and wrath
Est  If it is pleasing to the king let an order go out from him and let it be recorded among the laws of the Persians and the Medes so that it may never be changed that Vashti is never again to come before King Ahasuerus and let the king give her place to another who is better than she
Est  And when this order given by the king is made public through all his kingdom for it is great all the wives will give honour to their husbands great as well as small
Est  And this suggestion seemed good to the king and the captains and the king did as Memucan said
Est  And sent letters to all the divisions of the kingdom to every division in the writing commonly used there and to every people in the language which was theirs saying that every man was to be the ruler in his house and that this order was to be given out in the language of his people
Est  After these things when the kings feelings were calmer the thought of Vashti and what she had done and the order he had made against her came back to his mind
Est  Then the servants who were waiting on the king said to him Let search be made for some fair young virgins for the king
Est  Let the king give authority to certain men in all the divisions of his kingdom to get together all the fair young virgins and send them to Shushan the kings town to the womens house under the care of Hegai the kings servant the keeper of the women and let the things needed for making them clean be given to them
Est  And let the girl who is pleasing to the king be queen in place of Vashti And the king was pleased with this suggestion and he did so
Est  Now there was a certain Jew in Shushan named Mordecai the son of Jair the son of Shimei the son of Kish a Benjamite
Est  Who had been taken away from Jerusalem among those who had been made prisoner with Jeconiah king of Judah when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken him away
Est  And he had been a father to Hadassah that is Esther the daughter of his fathers brother for she had no father or mother and she was very beautiful and when her father and mother were dead Mordecai took her for his daughter
Est  So when the order made by the king was publicly given out and a number of girls had been placed in the care of Hegai in the kings house in Shushan Esther was taken into the kings house and put in the care of Hegai the keeper of the women
Est  And he was pleased with the girl and was kind to her and he quickly gave her what was needed for making her clean and the things which were hers by right and seven servantgirls who were to be hers from the kings house and he had her and her servantgirls moved to the best place in the womens part of the house
Est  Esther had not said what family or people she came from for Mordecai had given her orders not to do so
Est  And every day Mordecai took his walk before the square of the womens house to see how Esther was and what would be done to her
Est  Now every girl when her turn came had to go in to King Ahasuerus after undergoing for a space of twelve months what was ordered by the law for the women for this was the time necessary for making them clean that is six months with oil of myrrh and six months with sweet perfumes and such things as are needed for making women clean
Est  And in this way the girl went in to the king whatever she had a desire for was given to her to take with her from the womens house into the house of the king
Est  In the evening she went and on the day after she came back to the second house of the women into the keeping of Shaashgaz one of the kings unsexed servants who had the care of the kings wives only if the king had delight in her and sent for her by name did she go in to him again
Est  Now when the time came for Esther the daughter of Abihail his fathers brother whom Mordecai had taken as his daughter to go in to the king she made request for nothing but what Hegai the kings servant and keeper of the women had given her And Esther was looked on kindly by all who saw her
Est  So Esther was taken in to King Ahasuerus in his house in the tenth month which is the month Tebeth in the seventh year of his rule
Est  And Esther was more pleasing to the king than all the women and to his eyes she was fairer and more full of grace than all the other virgins so he put his crown on her head and made her queen in place of Vashti
Est  Then the king gave a great feast for all his captains and his servants even Esthers feast and he gave orders through all the divisions of his kingdom for a day of rest from work and gave wealth from his store
Est  And when the virgins came together in the second house of the women Mordecai took his seat in the doorway of the kings house
Est  Esther had still said nothing of her family or her people as Mordecai had given her orders for Esther did what Mordecai said as when she was living with him
Est  In those days while Mordecai was seated at the kings doorway two of the kings servants Bigthan and Teresh keepers of the door being angry were looking for a chance to make an attack on King Ahasuerus
Est  And Mordecai having knowledge of their purpose sent word of it to Esther the queen and Esther gave the news to the king in Mordecais name
Est  And when the thing had been looked into it was seen to be true and the two of them were put to death by hanging on a tree and it was put down in the records before the king
Est  After these things by the order of the king Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite was lifted up and given a position of honour and a higher place than all the other captains who were with him
Est  And all the kings servants who were in the kings house went down to the earth before Haman and gave him honour for so the king had given orders But Mordecai did not go down before him or give him honour
Est  Then the kings servants who were in the kings house said to Mordecai Why do you go against the kings order
Est  Now when they had said this to him day after day and he gave no attention they let Haman have news of it to see if Mordecais behaviour would be overlooked for he had said to them that he was a Jew
Est  And when Haman saw that Mordecai did not go down before him and give him honour Haman was full of wrath
Est  But it was not enough for him to make an attack on Mordecai only for they had made clear to him who Mordecais people were so Haman made it his purpose to put an end to all the Jews even Mordecais people through all the kingdom of Ahasuerus
Est  In the first month the month Nisan in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus from day to day and from month to month they went on looking for a sign given by Pur that is chance before Haman till the sign came out for the thirteenth day of the twelfth month the month Adar
Est  And Haman said to King Ahasuerus There is a certain nation living here and there in small groups among the people in all the divisions of your kingdom their laws are different from those of any other nation and they do not keep the kings laws for this reason it is not right for the king to let them be
Est  If it is the kings pleasure let a statement ordering their destruction be put in writing and I will give to those responsible for the kings business ten thousand talents of silver for the kings storehouse
Est  And the king took his ring from his hand and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite the hater of the Jews
Est  And the king said to Haman The money is yours and the people to do with them whatever seems right to you
Est  Then on the thirteenth day of the first month the kings scribes were sent for and they put in writing Hamans orders to all the kings captains and the rulers of every division of his kingdom and the chiefs of every people for every division of the kingdom in the writing commonly used there and to every people in the language which was theirs it was signed in the name of King Ahasuerus and stamped with the kings ring
Est  And letters were sent by the runners into every division of the kingdom ordering the death and destruction of all Jews young and old little children and women on the same day even the thirteenth day of the twelfth month the month Adar and the taking of all their goods by force
Est  A copy of the writing to be made public in every part of the kingdom was sent out to all the peoples so that they might be ready when that day came
Est  The runners went out quickly by the kings order and a public statement was made in Shushan and the king and Haman took wine together but the town of Shushan was troubled
Est  Now when Mordecai saw what was done pulling off his robe he put on haircloth with dust on his head and went out into the middle of the town crying out with a loud and bitter cry
Est  And he came even before the kings doorway for no one might come inside the kings door clothed in haircloth
Est  And in every part of the kingdom wherever the kings word and his order came there was great sorrow among the Jews and weeping and crying and going without food and numbers of them were stretched on the earth covered with dust and haircloth
Est  And Esthers women and her servants came and gave her word of it Then great was the grief of the queen and she sent robes for Mordecai so that his clothing of haircloth might be taken off but he would not have them
Est  Then Esther sent for Hathach one of the kings unsexed servants whom he had given her for waiting on her and she gave him orders to go to Mordecai and see what this was and why it was
Est  So Hathach went out and saw Mordecai in the open square of the town before the kings doorway
Est  And Mordecai gave him an account of what had taken place and of the amount of money which Haman had said he would put into the kings store for the destruction of the Jews
Est  And he gave him the copy of the order which had been given out in Shushan for their destruction ordering him to let Esther see it and to make it clear to her and to say to her that she was to go in to the king requesting his mercy and making prayer for her people
Est  And Hathach came back and gave Esther an account of what Mordecai had said
Est  Then Esther sent Hathach to say to Mordecai
Est  It is common knowledge among all the kings servants and the people of every part of the kingdom that if anyone man or woman comes to the king in his inner room without being sent for there is only one law for him that he is to be put to death only those to whom the kings rod of gold is stretched out may keep their lives but I have not been sent for to come before the king these thirty days
Est  And they said these words to Mordecai
Est  Then Mordecai sent this answer back to Esther Do not have the idea that you in the kings house will be safe from the fate of all the Jews
Est  If at this time you say nothing then help and salvation will come to the Jews from some other place but you and your fathers family will come to destruction and who is to say that you have not come to the kingdom even for such a time as this
Est  Then Esther sent them back to Mordecai with this answer
Est  Go get together all the Jews who are present in Shushan and go without food for me taking no food or drink night or day for three days and I and my women will do the same and so I will go in to the king which is against the law and if death is to be my fate then let it come
Est  So Mordecai went away and did everything as Esther had said
Est  Now on the third day Esther put on her queens robes and took her place in the inner room of the kings house facing the kings house and the king was seated on his high seat in the kings house facing the doorway of the house
Est  And when the king saw Esther the queen waiting in the inner room looking kindly on her he put out the rod of gold in his hand to her So Esther came near and put her fingers on the top of the rod
Est  Then the king said What is your desire Queen Esther and what is your request I will give it to you even to the half of my kingdom
Est  And Esther in answer said If it seems good to the king let the king and Haman come today to the feast which I have made ready for him
Est  Then the king said Let Haman come quickly so that what Esther has said may be done So the king and Haman came to the feast which Esther had made ready
Est  And while they were drinking wine the king said to Esther What is your prayer for it will be given to you and what is your request for it will be done even to the half of my kingdom
Est  Then Esther said in answer My prayer and my request is this
Est  If I have the kings approval and if it is the kings pleasure to give me my prayer and do my request let the king and Haman come to the feast which I will make ready for them and tomorrow I will do as the king has said
Est  Then on that day Haman went out full of joy and glad in heart but when he saw Mordecai in the kings doorway and he did not get to his feet or give any sign of fear before him Haman was full of wrath against Mordecai
Est  But controlling himself he went to his house and he sent for his friends and Zeresh his wife
Est  And he gave them an account of the glories of his wealth and the number of children he had and the ways in which he had been honoured by the king and how he had put him over the captains and servants of the king
Est  And Haman said further Truly Esther the queen let no man but myself come in to the feast which she had made ready for the king and tomorrow again I am to be her guest with the king
Est  But all this is nothing to me while I see Mordecai the Jew seated by the kings doorway
Est  Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him Let a pillar fifty cubits high be made ready for hanging him and in the morning get the king to give orders for the hanging of Mordecai then you will be able to go to the feast with the king with a glad heart And Haman was pleased with the suggestion and he had the pillar made
Est  That night the king was unable to get any sleep and he sent for the books of the records and while some one was reading them to the king
Est  It came out that it was recorded in the book how Mordecai had given word of the designs of Bigthana and Teresh two of the kings servants keepers of the door by whom an attack on the king had been designed
Est  And the king said What honour and reward have been given to Mordecai for this Then the servants who were waiting on the king said Nothing has been done for him
Est  Then the king said Who is in the outer room Now Haman had come into the outer room to get the kings authority for the hanging of Mordecai on the pillar which he had made ready for him
Est  And the kings servants said to him See Haman is waiting in the outer room And the king said Let him come in
Est  So Haman came in And the king said to him What is to be done to the man whom the king has delight in honouring Then the thought came into Hamans mind Whom more than myself would the king have pleasure in honouring
Est  And Haman answering the king said For the man whom the king has delight in honouring
Est  Let them take the robes which the king generally puts on and the horse on which the king goes and the crown which is on his head
Est  And let the robes and the horse be given to one of the kings most noble captains so that they may put them on the man whom the king has delight in honouring and let him go on horseback through the streets of the town with men crying out before him So let it be done to the man whom the king has delight in honouring
Est  Then the king said to Haman Go quickly and take the robes and the horse as you have said and do even so to Mordecai the Jew who is seated at the kings doorway see that you do everything as you have said
Est  Then Haman took the robes and the horse and dressing Mordecai in the robes he made him go on horseback through the streets of the town crying out before him So let it be done to the man whom the king has delight in honouring
Est  And Mordecai came back to the kings doorway But Haman went quickly back to his house sad and with his head covered
Est  And Haman gave his wife Zeresh and all his friends an account of what had taken place Then his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him If Mordecai who is starting to get the better of you is of the seed of the Jews you will not be able to do anything against him but you will certainly go down before him
Est  While they were still talking the kings servants came to take Haman to the feast which Esther had made ready
Est  So the king and Haman came to take wine with Esther the queen
Est  And the king said to Esther again on the second day while they were drinking What is your prayer Queen Esther for it will be given to you and what is your request for it will be done even to the half of my kingdom
Est  Then Esther the queen answering said If I have your approval O king and if it is the kings pleasure let my life be given to me in answer to my prayer and my people at my request
Est  For we are given up I and my people to destruction and death and to be cut off If we had been taken as menservants and womenservants for a price I would have said nothing for our trouble is little in comparison with the kings loss
Est  Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen Who is he and where is he who has had this evil thought in his heart
Est  And Esther said Our hater and attacker is this evil Haman Then Haman was full of fear before the king and the queen
Est  And the king in his wrath got up from the feast and went into the garden and Haman got to his feet to make a prayer for his life to Esther the queen for he saw that the kings purpose was evil against him
Est  Then the king came back from the garden into the room where they had been drinking and Haman was stretched out on the seat where Esther was Then the king said Is he taking the queen by force before my eyes in my house And while the words were on the kings lips they put a cloth over Hamans face
Est  Then Harbonah one of the unsexed servants waiting before the king said See the pillar fifty cubits high which Haman made for Mordecai who said a good word for the king is still in its place in Hamans house Then the king said Put him to death by hanging him on it
Est  So Haman was put to death by hanging him on the pillar he had made for Mordecai Then the kings wrath became less
Est  That day the king gave all the family of Haman the hater of the Jews to Esther the queen And Mordecai came before the king for Esther had made clear what he was to her
Est  And the king took off his ring which he had taken from Haman and gave it to Mordecai And Esther put Mordecai over the family of Haman
Est  Then Esther again came before the king falling down at his feet and made request to him with weeping that he would put a stop to the evil purposes of Haman the Agagite and the designs which he had made against the Jews
Est  Then the king put out the rod of gold to Esther and she got up before the king
Est  And she said If it is the kings pleasure and if I have his approval and this thing seems right to the king and I am pleasing to him then let letters be sent giving orders against those which Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite sent out for the destruction of the Jews in all divisions of the kingdom
Est  For how is it possible for me to see the evil which is to overtake my nation how may I see the destruction of my people
Est  Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew See now I have given Esther the family of Haman and he has come to his death by hanging because he made an attack on the Jews
Est  So now send a letter about the Jews writing whatever seems good to you in the kings name and stamping it with the kings ring for a writing signed in the kings name and stamped with the kings ring may not be changed
Est  Then at that time on the twentythird day of the third month which is the month Sivan the kings scribes were sent for and everything ordered by Mordecai was put in writing and sent to the Jews and the captains and the rulers and the chiefs of all the divisions of the kingdom from India to Ethiopia a hundred and twentyseven divisions to every division in the writing commonly used there and to every people in their language and to the Jews in their writing and their language
Est  The letters were sent in the name of King Ahasuerus and stamped with his ring and they were taken by men on horseback going on the quickrunning horses used for the kings business the offspring of his best horses
Est  In these letters the king gave authority to the Jews in every town to come together and make a fight for their lives and to send death and destruction on the power of any people in any part of the kingdom attacking them or their children or their women and to take their goods from them by force
Est  On one day in every division of the kingdom of Ahasuerus that is on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month the month Adar
Est  A copy of the writing to be made public as an order in every division of the kingdom was given out to all the peoples so that the Jews might be ready when that day came to give punishment to their haters
Est  So the men went out on the quickrunning horses used on the kings business wasting no time and forced on by the kings order and the order was given out in Shushan the kings town
Est  And Mordecai went out from before the king dressed in kinglike robes of blue and white and with a great crown of gold and clothing of purple and the best linen and all the town of Shushan gave loud cries of joy
Est  And the Jews had light and joy and honour
Est  And in every part of the kingdom and in every town wherever the kings letter and his order came the Jews were glad with great joy and had a feast and a good day And a great number of the people of the land became Jews for the fear of the Jews had come on them
Est  Now on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month which is the month Adar when the time came for the kings order to be put into effect on the very day when the haters of the Jews had been hoping to have rule over them though the opposite had come about and the Jews had rule over their haters
Est  On that day the Jews came together in their towns through all the divisions of the kingdom of Ahasuerus for the purpose of attacking all those who were attempting evil against them and everyone had to give way before them for the fear of them had come on all the peoples
Est  And all the chiefs and the captains and the rulers and those who did the kings business gave support to the Jews because the fear of Mordecai had come on them
Est  For Mordecai was great in the kings house and word of him went out through every part of the kingdom for the man Mordecai became greater and greater
Est  So the Jews overcame all their attackers with the sword and with death and destruction and did to their haters whatever they had a desire to do
Est  And in Shushan the Jews put to death five hundred men
Est  They put to death Parshandatha Dalphon Aspatha
Est  Poratha Adalia Aridatha
Est  Parmashta Arisai Aridai and Vaizatha
Est  The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha the hater of the Jews but they put not a hand on any of their goods
Est  On that day the number of those who had been put to death in the town of Shushan was given to the king
Est  And the king said to Esther the queen The Jews have put five hundred men to death in Shushan as well as the ten sons of Haman what then have they done in the rest of the kingdom Now what is your prayer for it will be given to you what other request have you and it will be done
Est  Then Esther said If it is the kings pleasure let authority be given to the Jews in Shushan to do tomorrow as has been done today and let orders be given for the hanging of Hamans ten sons
Est  And the king said that this was to be done and the order was given out in Shushan and the hanging of Hamans ten sons was effected
Est  For the Jews who were in Shushan came together again on the fourteenth day of the month Adar and put to death three hundred men in Shushan but they put not a hand on their goods
Est  And the other Jews in every division of the kingdom came together fighting for their lives and got salvation from their haters and put seventyfive thousand of them to death but they did not put a hand on their goods
Est  This they did on the thirteenth day of the month Adar and on the fourteenth day of the same month they took their rest and made it a day of feasting and joy
Est  But the Jews in Shushan came together on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth day of the month and on the fifteenth day they took their rest and made it a day of feasting and joy
Est  So the Jews of the country places living in unwalled towns make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of feasting and joy and a good day a day for sending offerings one to another
Est  And Mordecai sent letters to all the Jews in every division of the kingdom of Ahasuerus near and far
Est  Ordering them to keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar and the fifteenth day of the same month every year
Est  As days on which the Jews had rest from their haters and the month which for them was turned from sorrow to joy and from weeping to a good day and that they were to keep them as days of feasting and joy of sending offerings to one another and good things to the poor
Est  And the Jews gave their word to go on as they had been doing and as Mordecai had given them orders in writing
Est  Because Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite the hater of all the Jews had made designs for their destruction attempting to get a decision by Pur that is chance with a view to putting an end to them and cutting them off
Est  But when the business was put before the king he gave orders by letters that the evil design which he had made against the Jews was to be turned against himself and that he and his sons were to be put to death by hanging
Est  So these days were named Purim after the name of Pur And so because of the words of this letter and of what they had seen in connection with this business and what had come to them
Est  The Jews made a rule and gave an undertaking causing their seed and all those who were joined to them to do the same so that it might be in force for ever that they would keep those two days as ordered in the letter at the fixed time every year
Est  And that those days were to be kept in memory through every generation and every family in every division of the kingdom and every town that there might never be a time when these days of Purim would not be kept among the Jews or when the memory of them would go from the minds of their seed
Est  Then Esther the queen daughter of Abihail and Mordecai the Jew sent a second letter giving the force of their authority to the order about the Purim
Est  And he sent letters to all the Jews in the hundred and twentyseven divisions of the kingdom of Ahasuerus with true words of peace
Est  Giving the force of law to these days of Purim at their fixed times as they had been ordered by Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen and in keeping with the rules they had made for themselves and their seed in connection with their time of going without food and their cry for help
Est  The order given by Esther gave the force of law to the rules about the Purim and it was recorded in the book
Est  And King Ahasuerus put a tax on the land and on the islands of the sea
Est  And all his acts of power and his great strength and the full story of the high place which the king gave Mordecai are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Media and Persia
Est  For Mordecai the Jew was second only to King Ahasuerus and great among the Jews and respected by the body of his countrymen working for the good of his people and saying words of peace to all his seed
Job  There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job He was without sin and upright fearing God and keeping himself far from evil
Job  And he had seven sons and three daughters
Job  And of cattle he had seven thousand sheep and goats and three thousand camels and a thousand oxen and five hundred sheasses and a very great number of servants And the man was greater than any of the sons of the east
Job  His sons regularly went to one anothers houses and every one on his day gave a feast and at these times they sent for their three sisters to take part in their feasts with them
Job  And at the end of their days of feasting Job sent and made them clean getting up early in the morning and offering burned offerings for them all For Job said It may be that my sons have done wrong and said evil of God in their hearts And Job did this whenever the feasts came round
Job  And there was a day when the sons of the gods came together before the Lord and the Satan came with them
Job  And the Lord said to the Satan Where do you come from And the Satan said in answer From wandering this way and that on the earth and walking about on it
Job  And the Lord said to the Satan Have you taken note of my servant Job for there is no one like him on the earth a man without sin and upright fearing God and keeping himself far from evil
Job  And the Satan said in answer to the Lord Is it for nothing that Job is a godfearing man
Job  Have you yourself not put a wall round him and his house and all he has on every side blessing the work of his hands and increasing his cattle in the land
Job  But now put out your hand against all he has and he will be cursing you to your face
Job  And the Lord said to the Satan See I give all he has into your hands only do not put a finger on the man himself And the Satan went out from before the Lord
Job  And there was a day when his sons and daughters were feasting in the house of their oldest brother
Job  And a man came to Job and said The oxen were ploughing and the asses were taking their food by their side
Job  And the men of Sheba came against them and took them away putting the young men to the sword and I was the only one who got away safe to give you the news
Job  And this one was still talking when another came and said The fire of God came down from heaven burning up the sheep and the goats and the young men completely and I was the only one who got away safe to give you the news
Job  And this one was still talking when another came and said The Chaldaeans made themselves into three bands and came down on the camels and took them away putting the young men to the sword and I was the only one who got away safe to give you the news
Job  And this one was still talking when another came and said Your sons and your daughters were feasting together in their oldest brothers house
Job  When a great wind came rushing from the waste land against the four sides of the house and it came down on the young men and they are dead and I was the only one who got away safe to give you the news
Job  Then Job got up and after parting his clothing and cutting off his hair he went down on his face to the earth and gave worship and said
Job  With nothing I came out of my mothers body and with nothing I will go back there the Lord gave and the Lord has taken away let the Lords name be praised
Job  In all this Job did no sin and did not say that Gods acts were foolish
Job  And there was a day when the sons of the gods came together before the Lord and the Satan came with them
Job  And the Lord said to the Satan Where do you come from And the Satan said in answer From wandering this way and that on the earth and walking about on it
Job  And the Lord said to the Satan Have you taken note of my servant Job for there is no one like him on the earth a man without sin and upright fearing God and keeping himself far from evil and he still keeps his righteousness though you have been moving me to send destruction on him without cause
Job  And the Satan said in answer to the Lord Skin for skin all a man has he will give for his life
Job  But now if you only put your hand on his bone and his flesh he will certainly be cursing you to your face
Job  And the Lord said to the Satan See he is in your hands only do not take his life
Job  And the Satan went out from before the Lord and sent on Job an evil disease covering his skin from his feet to the top of his head
Job  And he took a broken bit of a pot and seated in the dust was rubbing himself with the sharp edge of it
Job  And his wife said to him Are you still keeping your righteousness Say a curse against God and put an end to yourself
Job  And he said to her You are talking like one of the foolish women If we take the good God sends us are we not to take the evil when it comes In all this Job kept his lips from sin
Job  And Jobs three friends had word of all this evil which had come on him And they came every one from his place Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite So they came together to a meetingplace in order that they might go and make clear to Job their grief for him and give him comfort
Job  And lifting up their eyes when they were still far off it did not seem that the man they saw was Job because of the change in him And they gave way to bitter weeping with signs of grief and put dust on their heads
Job  And they took their seats on the earth by his side for seven days and seven nights but no one said a word to him for they saw that his pain was very great
Job  Then opening his mouth and cursing the day of his birth
Job  Job made answer and said
Job  Let destruction take the day of my birth and the night on which it was said A man child has come into the world
Job  That daylet it be dark let not God take note of it from on high and let not the light be shining on it
Job  Let the dark and the black night take it for themselves let it be covered with a cloud let the dark shades of day send fear on it
Job  That nightlet the thick dark take it let it not have joy among the days of the year let it not come into the number of the months
Job  As for that night let it have no fruit let no voice of joy be sounded in it
Job  Let it be cursed by those who put a curse on the day who are ready to make Leviathan awake
Job  Let its morning stars be dark let it be looking for light but may it not have any let it not see the eyes of the dawn
Job  Because it did not keep the doors of my mothers body shut so that trouble might be veiled from my eyes
Job  Why did death not take me when I came out of my mothers body why did I not when I came out give up my last breath
Job  Why did the knees take me or why the breasts that they might give me milk
Job  For then I might have gone to my rest in quiet and in sleep have been in peace
Job  With kings and the wise ones of the earth who put up great houses for themselves
Job  Or with rulers who had gold and whose houses were full of silver
Job  Or as a child dead at birth I might never have come into existence like young children who have not seen the light
Job  There the passions of the evil are over and those whose strength has come to an end have rest
Job  There the prisoners are at peace together the voice of the overseer comes not again to their ears
Job  The small and the great are there and the servant is free from his master
Job  Why does he give light to him who is in trouble and life to the bitter in soul
Job  To those whose desire is for death but it comes not who are searching for it more than for secret wealth
Job  Who are glad with great joy and full of delight when they come to their last restingplace
Job  To a man whose way is veiled and who is shut in by God
Job  In place of my food I have grief and cries of sorrow come from me like water
Job  For I have a fear and it comes on me and my heart is greatly troubled
Job  I have no peace no quiet and no rest nothing but pain comes on me
Job  And Eliphaz the Temanite made answer and said
Job  If one says a word will it be a weariness to you but who is able to keep from saying what is in his mind
Job  Truly you have been a helper to others and you have made feeble hands strong
Job  He who was near to falling has been lifted up by your words and you have given strength to bent knees
Job  But now it has come on you and it is a weariness to you you are touched by it and your mind is troubled
Job  Is not your fear of God your support and your upright way of life your hope
Job  Have you ever seen destruction come to an upright man or when were the godfearing ever cut off
Job  What I have seen is that those by whom trouble has been ploughed and evil planted get the same for themselves
Job  By the breath of God destruction takes them and by the wind of his wrath they are cut off
Job  Though the noise of the lion and the sounding of his voice may be loud the teeth of the young lions are broken
Job  The old lion comes to his end for need of food and the young of the shelion go wandering in all directions
Job  A word was given to me secretly and the low sound of it came to my ears
Job  In troubled thoughts from visions of the night when deep sleep comes on men
Job  Fear came on me and shaking and my bones were full of trouble
Job  And a breath was moving over my face the hair of my flesh became stiff
Job  Something was present before me but I was not able to see it clearly there was a form before my eyes a quiet voice came to my ears saying
Job  May a man be upright before God or a man be clean before his Maker
Job  Truly he puts no faith in his servants and he sees error in his angels
Job  How much more those living in houses of earth whose bases are in the dust They are crushed more quickly than an insect
Job  Between morning and evening they are completely broken they come to an end for ever and no one takes note
Job  If their tentcord is pulled up do they not come to an end and without wisdom
Job  Give now a cry for help is there anyone who will give you an answer and to which of the holy ones will you make your prayer
Job  For wrath is the cause of death to the foolish and he who has no wisdom comes to his end through passion
Job  I have seen the foolish taking root but suddenly the curse came on his house
Job  Now his children have no safe place and they are crushed before the judges for no one takes up their cause
Job  Their produce is taken by him who has no food and their grain goes to the poor and he who is in need of water gets it from their spring
Job  For evil does not come out of the dust or trouble out of the earth
Job  But trouble is mans fate from birth as the flames go up from the fire
Job  But as for me I would make my prayer to God and I would put my cause before him
Job  Who does great things outside our knowledge wonders without number
Job  Who gives rain on the earth and sends water on the fields
Job  Lifting up those who are low and putting the sad in a safe place
Job  Who makes the designs of the wise go wrong so that they are unable to give effect to their purposes
Job  He takes the wise in their secret designs and the purposes of the twisted are cut off suddenly
Job  In the daytime it becomes dark for them and in the sunlight they go feeling about as if it was night
Job  But he keeps safe from their sword those who have no father and the poor from the power of the strong
Job  So the poor man has hope and the mouth of the evildoer is stopped
Job  Truly that man is happy who has training from the hand of God so do not let your heart be shut to the teaching of the Ruler of all
Job  For after his punishment he gives comfort and after wounding his hands make you well
Job  He will keep you safe from six troubles and in seven no evil will come near you
Job  When there is need of food he will keep you from death and in war from the power of the sword
Job  He will keep you safe from the evil tongue and you will have no fear of wasting when it comes
Job  You will make sport of destruction and need and will have no fear of the beasts of the earth
Job  For you will be in agreement with the stones of the earth and the beasts of the field will be at peace with you
Job  And you will be certain that your tent is at peace and after looking over your property you will see that nothing is gone
Job  You will be certain that your seed will be great and your offspring like the plants of the earth
Job  You will come to your last restingplace in full strength as the grain is taken up to the crushingfloor in its time
Job  See we have made search with care and it is so it has come to our ears see that you take note of it for yourself
Job  And Job made answer and said
Job  If only my passion might be measured and put into the scales against my trouble
Job  For then its weight would be more than the sand of the seas because of this my words have been uncontrolled
Job  For the arrows of the Ruler of all are present with me and their poison goes deep into my spirit his army of fears is put in order against me
Job  Does the ass of the fields give out his voice when he has grass or does the ox make sounds over his food
Job  Will a man take food which has no taste without salt or is there any taste in the soft substance of purslain
Job  My soul has no desire for such things they are as disease in my food
Job  If only I might have an answer to my prayer and God would give me my desire
Job  If only he would be pleased to put an end to me and would let loose his hand so that I might be cut off
Job  So I would still have comfort and I would have joy in the pains of death for I have not been false to the words of the Holy One
Job  Have I strength to go on waiting or have I any end to be looking forward to
Job  Is my strength the strength of stones or is my flesh brass
Job  I have no help in myself and wisdom is completely gone from me
Job  He whose heart is shut against his friend has given up the fear of the Ruler of all
Job  My friends have been false like a stream like streams in the valleys which come to an end
Job  Which are dark because of the ice and the snow falling into them
Job  Under the burning sun they are cut off and come to nothing because of the heat
Job  The cameltrains go out of their way they go up into the waste and come to destruction
Job  The cameltrains of Tema were searching with care the bands of Sheba were waiting for them
Job  They were put to shame because of their hope they came and their hope was gone
Job  So have you now become to me you see my sad condition and are in fear
Job  Did I say Give me something or Make a payment for me out of your wealth
Job  Or Get me out of the power of my hater or Give money so that I may be free from the power of the cruel ones
Job  Give me teaching and I will be quiet and make me see my error
Job  How pleasing are upright words but what force is there in your arguments
Job  My words may seem wrong to you but the words of him who has no hope are for the wind
Job  Truly you are such as would give up the child of a dead man to his creditors and would make a profit out of your friend
Job  Now then let your eyes be turned to me for truly I will not say what is false to your face
Job  Let your minds be changed and do not have an evil opinion of me yes be changed for my righteousness is still in me
Job  Is there evil in my tongue is not the cause of my trouble clear to me
Job  Has not man his ordered time of trouble on the earth and are not his days like the days of a servant working for payment
Job  As a servant desiring the shades of evening and a workman looking for his payment
Job  So I have for my heritage months of pain to no purpose and nights of weariness are given to me
Job  When I go to my bed I say When will it be time to get up but the night is long and I am turning from side to side till morning light
Job  My flesh is covered with worms and dust my skin gets hard and then is cracked again
Job  My days go quicker than the clothworkers thread and come to an end without hope
Job  O keep in mind that my life is wind my eye will never again see good
Job  The eye of him who sees me will see me no longer your eyes will be looking for me but I will be gone
Job  A cloud comes to an end and is gone so he who goes down into the underworld comes not up again
Job  He will not come back to his house and his place will have no more knowledge of him
Job  So I will not keep my mouth shut I will let the words come from it in the pain of my spirit my soul will make a bitter outcry
Job  Am I a sea or a seabeast that you put a watch over me
Job  When I say In my bed I will have comfort there I will get rest from my disease
Job  Then you send dreams to me and visions of fear
Job  So that a hard death seems better to my soul than my pains
Job  I have no desire for life I would not be living for ever Keep away from me for my days are as a breath
Job  What is man that you have made him great and that your attention is fixed on him
Job  And that your hand is on him every morning and that you are testing him every minute
Job  How long will it be before your eyes are turned away from me so that I may have a minutes breathingspace
Job  If I have done wrong what have I done to you O keeper of men why have you made me a mark for your blows so that I am a weariness to myself
Job  And why do you not take away my sin and let my wrongdoing be ended for now I go down to the dust and you will be searching for me with care but I will be gone
Job  Then Bildad the Shuhite made answer and said
Job  How long will you say these things and how long will the words of your mouth be like a strong wind
Job  Does God give wrong decisions or is the Ruler of all not upright in his judging
Job  If your children have done evil against him then their punishment is from his hand
Job  If you will make search for God with care and put your request before the Ruler of all
Job  If you are clean and upright then he will certainly be moved to take up your cause and will make clear your righteousness by building up your house again
Job  And though your start was small your end will be very great
Job  Put the question now to the past generations and give attention to what has been searched out by their fathers
Job  For we are but of yesterday and have no knowledge because our days on earth are gone like a shade
Job  Will they not give you teaching and say words of wisdom to you
Job  Will the riverplant come up in its pride without wet earth will the grass get tall without water
Job  When it is still green without being cut down it becomes dry and dead before any other plant
Job  So is the end of all who do not keep God in mind and the hope of the evildoer comes to nothing
Job  Whose support is cut off and whose hope is no stronger than a spiders thread
Job  He is looking to his family for support but it is not there he puts his hope in it but it comes to nothing
Job  He is full of strength before the sun and his branches go out over his garden
Job  His roots are twisted round the stones forcing their way in between them
Job  If he is taken away from his place then it will say I have not seen you
Job  Such is the joy of his way and out of the dust another comes up to take his place
Job  Truly God will not give up him who is without sin and will not take evildoers by the hand
Job  The time will come when your mouth will be full of laughing and cries of joy will come from your lips
Job  Your haters will be clothed with shame and the tent of the sinner will not be seen again
Job  And Job made answer and said
Job  Truly I see that it is so and how is it possible for a man to get his right before God
Job  If a man was desiring to go to law with him he would not be able to give him an answer to one out of a thousand questions
Job  He is wise in heart and great in strength who ever made his face hard against him and any good came of it
Job  It is he who takes away the mountains without their knowledge overturning them in his wrath
Job  Who is moving the earth out of its place so that its pillars are shaking
Job  Who gives orders to the sun and it does not give its light and who keeps the stars from shining
Job  By whose hand the heavens were stretched out and who is walking on the waves of the sea
Job  Who made the Bear and Orion and the Pleiades and the storehouses of the south
Job  Who does great things not to be searched out yes wonders without number
Job  See he goes past me and I see him not he goes on before but I have no knowledge of him
Job  If he puts out his hand to take by whom may it be turned back who may say to him What are you doing
Job  Gods wrath may not be turned back the helpers of Rahab were bent down under him
Job  How much less may I give an answer to him using the right words in argument with him
Job  Even if my cause was good I would not be able to give an answer I would make request for grace from him who was against me
Job  If I had sent for him to be present and he had come I would have no faith that he would give ear to my voice
Job  For I would be crushed by his storm my wounds would be increased without cause
Job  He would not let me take my breath but I would be full of bitter grief
Job  If it is a question of strength he says Here I am and if it is a question of a cause at law he says Who will give me a fixed day
Job  Though I was in the right he would say that I was in the wrong I have done no evil but he says that I am a sinner
Job  I have done no wrong I give no thought to what becomes of me I have no desire for life
Job  It is all the same to me so I say He puts an end to the sinner and to him who has done no wrong together
Job  If death comes suddenly through disease he makes sport of the fate of those who have done no wrong
Job  The land is given into the power of the evildoer the faces of its judges are covered if not by him then who has done it
Job  My days go quicker than a postrunner they go in flight they see no good
Job  They go rushing on like reedboats like an eagle dropping suddenly on its food
Job  If I say I will put my grief out of mind I will let my face be sad no longer and I will be bright
Job  I go in fear of all my pains I am certain that I will not be free from sin in your eyes
Job  You will not let me be clear of sin why then do I take trouble for nothing
Job  If I am washed with snow water and make my hands clean with soap
Job  Then you will have me pushed into the dust so that I will seem disgusting to my very clothing
Job  For he is not a man as I am that I might give him an answer that we might come together before a judge
Job  There is no one to give a decision between us who might have control over us
Job  Let him take away his rod from me and not send his fear on me
Job  Then I would say what is in my mind without fear of him for there is no cause of fear in myself
Job  My soul is tired of life I will let my sad thoughts go free in words my soul will make a bitter outcry
Job  I will say to God Do not put me down as a sinner make clear to me what you have against me
Job  What profit is it to you to be cruel to give up the work of your hands looking kindly on the design of evildoers
Job  Have you eyes of flesh or do you see as man sees
Job  Are your days as the days of man or your years like his
Job  That you take note of my sin searching after my wrongdoing
Job  Though you see that I am not an evildoer and there is no one who is able to take a man out of your hands
Job  Your hands made me and I was formed by you but then changing your purpose you gave me up to destruction
Job  O keep in mind that you made me out of earth and will you send me back again to dust
Job  Was I not drained out like milk becoming hard like cheese
Job  By you I was clothed with skin and flesh and joined together with bones and muscles
Job  You have been kind to me and your grace has been with me and your care has kept my spirit safe
Job  But you kept these things in the secret of your heart I am certain this was in your thoughts
Job  That if I did wrong you would take note of it and would not make me clear from sin
Job  That if I was an evildoer the curse would come on me and if I was upright my head would not be lifted up being full of shame and overcome with trouble
Job  And that if there was cause for pride you would go after me like a lion and again put out your wonders against me
Job  That you would send new witnesses against me increasing your wrath against me and letting loose new armies on me
Job  Why then did you make me come out of my mothers body It would have been better for me to have taken my last breath and for no eye to have seen me
Job  And for me to have been as if I had not been to have been taken from my mothers body straight to my last restingplace
Job  Are not the days of my life small in number Let your eyes be turned away from me so that I may have a little pleasure
Job  Before I go to the place from which I will not come back to the land where all is dark and black
Job  A land of thick dark without order where the very light is dark
Job  Then Zophar the Naamathite made answer and said
Job  Are all these words to go unanswered and is a man seen to be right because he is full of talk
Job  Are your words of pride to make men keep quiet and are you to make sport with no one to put you to shame
Job  You may say My way is clean and I am free from sin in your eyes
Job  But if only God would take up the word opening his lips in argument with you
Job  And would make clear to you the secrets of wisdom and the wonders of his purpose
Job  Are you able to take Gods measure to make discovery of the limits of the Ruler of all
Job  They are higher than heaven what is there for you to do deeper than the underworld and outside your knowledge
Job  Longer in measure than the earth and wider than the sea
Job  If he goes on his way shutting a man up and putting him to death who may make him go back from his purpose
Job  For in his eyes men are as nothing he sees evil and takes note of it
Job  And so a hollowminded man will get wisdom when a young ass of the field gets teaching
Job  But if you put your heart right stretching out your hands to him
Job  If you put far away the evil of your hands and let no wrongdoing have a place in your tent
Job  Then truly your face will be lifted up with no mark of sin and you will be fixed in your place without fear
Job  For your sorrow will go from your memory like waters flowing away
Job  And your life will be brighter than day though it is dark it will become like the morning
Job  And you will be safe because there is hope after looking round you will take your rest in quiet
Job  Sleeping with no fear of danger and men will be desiring to have grace in your eyes
Job  But the eyes of the evildoers will be wasting away their way of flight is gone and their only hope is the taking of their last breath
Job  And Job made answer and said
Job  No doubt you have knowledge and wisdom will come to an end with you
Job  But I have a mind as well as you I am equal to you yes who has not knowledge of such things as these
Job  It seems that I am to be as one who is a cause of laughing to his neighbour one who makes his prayer to God and is answered the upright man who has done no wrong is to be made sport of
Job  In the thought of him who is in comfort there is no respect for one who is in trouble such is the fate of those whose feet are slipping
Job  There is wealth in the tents of those who make destruction and those by whom God is moved to wrath are safe even those whose god is their strength
Job  But put now a question to the beasts and get teaching from them or to the birds of the heaven and they will make it clear to you
Job  Or to the things which go flat on the earth and they will give you wisdom and the fishes of the sea will give you news of it
Job  Who does not see by all these that the hand of the Lord has done this
Job  In whose hand is the soul of every living thing and the breath of all flesh of man
Job  Are not words tested by the ear even as food is tasted by the mouth
Job  Old men have wisdom and a long life gives knowledge
Job  With him there is wisdom and strength power and knowledge are his
Job  Truly there is no building up of what is pulled down by him when a man is shut up by him no one may let him loose
Job  Truly he keeps back the waters and they are dry he sends them out and the earth is overturned
Job  With him are strength and wise designs he who is guided into error together with his guide are in his hands
Job  He takes away the wisdom of the wise guides and makes judges foolish
Job  He undoes the chains of kings and puts his band on them
Job  He makes priests prisoners overturning those in safe positions
Job  He makes the words of responsible persons without effect and takes away the good sense of the old
Job  He puts shame on chiefs and takes away the power of the strong
Job  Uncovering deep things out of the dark and making the deep shade bright
Job  Increasing nations and sending destruction on them making wide the lands of peoples and then giving them up
Job  He takes away the wisdom of the rulers of the earth and sends them wandering in a waste where there is no way
Job  They go feeling about in the dark without light wandering without help like those overcome with wine
Job  Truly my eye has seen all this word of it has come to my ear and I have knowledge of it
Job  The same things are in my mind as in yours I am equal to you
Job  But I would have talk with the Ruler of all and my desire is to have an argument with God
Job  But you put a false face on things all your attempts to put things right are of no value
Job  If only you would keep quiet it would be a sign of wisdom
Job  Give ear to the argument of my mouth and take note of the words of my lips
Job  Will you say in Gods name what is not right and put false words into his mouth
Job  Will you have respect for Gods person in this cause and put yourselves forward as his supporters
Job  Will it be good for you to be searched out by him or have you the thought that he may be guided into error like a man
Job  He will certainly put you right if you have respect for persons in secret
Job  Will not his glory put you in fear so that your hearts will be overcome before him
Job  Your wise sayings are only dust and your strong places are only earth
Job  Keep quiet and let me say what is in my mind whatever may come to me
Job  I will take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in my hand
Job  Truly he will put an end to me I have no hope but I will not give way in argument before him
Job  And that will be my salvation for an evildoer would not come before him
Job  Give ear with care to my words and keep what I say in your minds
Job  See now I have put my cause in order and I am certain that I will be seen to be right
Job  Is any one able to take up the argument against me If so I would keep quiet and give up my breath
Job  Only two things do not do to me then I will come before your face
Job  Take your hand far away from me and let me not be overcome by fear of you
Job  Then at the sound of your voice I will give answer or let me put forward my cause for you to give me an answer
Job  What is the number of my evildoings and my sins give me knowledge of them
Job  Why is your face veiled from me as if I was numbered among your haters
Job  Will you be hard on a leaf in flight before the wind will you make a dry stem go more quickly on its way
Job  For you put bitter things on record against me and send punishment on me for the sins of my early years
Job  And you put chains on my feet watching all my ways and making a limit for my steps
Job  Though a man comes to nothing like a bit of dead wood or like a robe which has become food for the worm
Job  As for man the son of woman his days are short and full of trouble
Job  He comes out like a flower and is cut down he goes in flight like a shade and is never seen again
Job  Is it on such a one as this that your eyes are fixed with the purpose of judging him
Job  If only a clean thing might come out of an unclean But it is not possible
Job  If his days are ordered and you have knowledge of the number of his months having given him a fixed limit past which he may not go
Job  Let your eyes be turned away from him and take your hand from him so that he may have pleasure at the end of his day like a servant working for payment
Job  For there is hope of a tree if it is cut down it will come to life again and its branches will not come to an end
Job  Though its root may be old in the earth and its cutoff end may be dead in the dust
Job  Still at the smell of water it will make buds and put out branches like a young plant
Job  But man comes to his death and is gone he gives up his spirit and where is he
Job  The waters go from a pool and a river becomes waste and dry
Job  So man goes down to his last restingplace and comes not again till the heavens come to an end they will not be awake or come out of their sleep
Job  If only you would keep me safe in the underworld putting me in a secret place till your wrath is past giving me a fixed time when I might come to your memory again
Job  If death takes a man will he come to life again All the days of my trouble I would be waiting till the time came for me to be free
Job  At the sound of your voice I would give an answer and you would have a desire for the work of your hands
Job  For now my steps are numbered by you and my sin is not overlooked
Job  My wrongdoing is corded up in a bag and my sin is shut up safe
Job  But truly a mountain falling comes to dust and a rock is moved from its place
Job  The stones are crushed small by the force of the waters the dust of the earth is washed away by their overflowing and so you put an end to the hope of man
Job  You overcome him for ever and he is gone his face is changed in death and you send him away
Job  His sons come to honour and he has no knowledge of it they are made low but he is not conscious of it
Job  Only his flesh still has pain and his soul is sad
Job  And Eliphaz the Temanite made answer and said
Job  Will a wise man make answer with knowledge of no value or will he give birth to the east wind
Job  Will he make arguments with words in which is no profit and with sayings which have no value
Job  Truly you make the fear of God without effect so that the time of quiet worship before God is made less by your outcry
Job  For your mouth is guided by your sin and you have taken the tongue of the false for yourself
Job  It is by your mouth even yours that you are judged to be in the wrong and not by me and your lips give witness against you
Job  Were you the first man to come into the world or did you come into being before the hills
Job  Were you present at the secret meeting of God and have you taken all wisdom for yourself
Job  What knowledge have you which we have not is there anything in your mind which is not in ours
Job  With us are men who are greyhaired and full of years much older than your father
Job  Are the comforts of God not enough for you and the gentle word which was said to you
Job  Why is your heart uncontrolled and why are your eyes lifted up
Job  So that you are turning your spirit against God and letting such words go out of your mouth
Job  What is man that he may be clean and how may the son of woman be upright
Job  Truly he puts no faith in his holy ones and the heavens are not clean in his eyes
Job  How much less one who is disgusting and unclean a man who takes in evil like water
Job  Take note and give ear to my words and I will say what I have seen
Job  The things which wise men have got from their fathers and have not kept secret from us
Job  For only to them was the land given and no strange people were among them
Job  The evil man is in pain all his days and the number of the years stored up for the cruel is small
Job  A sound of fear is in his ears in time of peace destruction will come on him
Job  He has no hope of coming safe out of the dark and his fate will be the sword
Job  He is wandering about in search of bread saying Where is it and he is certain that the day of trouble is ready for him
Job  He is greatly in fear of the dark day trouble and pain overcome him
Job  Because his hand is stretched out against God and his heart is lifted up against the Ruler of all
Job  Running against him like a man of war covered by his thick breastplate even like a king ready for the fight
Job  Because his face is covered with fat and his body has become thick
Job  And he has made his restingplace in the towns which have been pulled down in houses where no man had a right to be whose fate was to become masses of broken walls
Job  He does not get wealth for himself and is unable to keep what he has got the heads of his grain are not bent down to the earth
Job  He does not come out of the dark his branches are burned by the flame and the wind takes away his bud
Job  Let him not put his hope in what is false falling into error for he will get deceit as his reward
Job  His branch is cut off before its time and his leaf is no longer green
Job  He is like a vine whose grapes do not come to full growth or an olivetree dropping its flowers
Job  For the band of the evildoers gives no fruit and the tents of those who give wrong decisions for reward are burned with fire
Job  Evil has made them with child and they give birth to trouble and the fruit of their body is shame for themselves
Job  And Job made answer and said
Job  Such things have frequently come to my ears you are comforters who only give trouble
Job  May words which are like the wind be stopped or what is troubling you to make answer to them
Job  It would not be hard for me to say such things if your souls were in my souls place joining words together against you and shaking my head at you
Job  I might give you strength with my mouth and not keep back the comfort of my lips
Job  If I say what is in my mind my pain becomes no less and if I keep quiet how much of it goes from me
Job  But now he has overcome me with weariness and fear and I am in the grip of all my trouble
Job  It has come up as a witness against me and the wasting of my flesh makes answer to my face
Job  I am broken by his wrath and his hate has gone after me he has made his teeth sharp against me my haters are looking on me with cruel eyes
Job  Their mouths are open wide against me the blows of his bitter words are falling on my face all of them come together in a mass against me
Job  God gives me over to the power of sinners sending me violently into the hands of evildoers
Job  I was in comfort but I have been broken up by his hands he has taken me by the neck shaking me to bits he has put me up as a mark for his arrows
Job  His bowmen come round about me their arrows go through my body without mercy my life is drained out on the earth
Job  I am broken with wound after wound he comes rushing on me like a man of war
Job  I have made haircloth the clothing of my skin and my horn is rolled in the dust
Job  My face is red with weeping and my eyes are becoming dark
Job  Though my hands have done no violent acts and my prayer is clean
Job  O earth let not my blood be covered and let my cry have no restingplace
Job  Even now my witness is in heaven and the supporter of my cause is on high
Job  My friends make sport of me to God my eyes are weeping
Job  So that he may give decision for a man in his cause with God and between a son of man and his neighbour
Job  For in a short time I will take the journey from which I will not come back
Job  My spirit is broken my days are ended the last restingplace is ready for me
Job  Truly those who make sport of me are round about me and my eyes become dark because of their bitter laughing
Job  Be pleased now to be responsible for me to yourself for there is no other who will put his hand in mine
Job  You have kept their hearts from wisdom for this cause you will not give them honour
Job  As for him who is false to his friend for a reward light will be cut off from the eyes of his children
Job  He has made me a word of shame to the peoples I have become a mark for their sport
Job  My eyes have become dark because of my pain and all my body is wasted to a shade
Job  The upright are surprised at this and he who has done no wrong is troubled because of the evildoers
Job  Still the upright keeps on his way and he who has clean hands gets new strength
Job  But come back now all of you come and I will not see a wise man among you
Job  My days are past my purposes are broken off even the desires of my heart
Job  They are changing night into day they say The light is near the dark
Job  If I am waiting for the underworld as my house if I have made my bed in the dark
Job  If I say to the earth You are my father and to the worm My mother and my sister
Job  Where then is my hope and who will see my desire
Job  Will they go down with me into the underworld Will we go down together into the dust
Job  Then Bildad the Shuhite made answer and said
Job  How long will it be before you have done talking Get wisdom and then we will say what is in our minds
Job  Why do we seem as beasts in your eyes and as completely without knowledge
Job  But come back now come you who are wounding yourself in your passion will the earth be given up because of you or a rock be moved out of its place
Job  For the light of the sinner is put out and the flame of his fire is not shining
Job  The light is dark in his tent and the light shining over him is put out
Job  The steps of his strength become short and by his design destruction overtakes him
Job  His feet take him into the net and he goes walking into the cords
Job  His foot is taken in the net he comes into its grip
Job  The twisted cord is put secretly in the earth to take him and the cord is placed in his way
Job  He is overcome by fears on every side they go after him at every step
Job  His strength is made feeble for need of food and destruction is waiting for his falling footstep
Job  His skin is wasted by disease and his body is food for the worst of diseases
Job  He is pulled out of his tent where he was safe and he is taken away to the king of fears
Job  In his tent will be seen that which is not his burning stone is dropped on his house
Job  Under the earth his roots are dry and over it his branch is cut off
Job  His memory is gone from the earth and in the open country there is no knowledge of his name
Job  He is sent away from the light into the dark he is forced out of the world
Job  He has no offspring or family among his people and in his livingplace there is no one of his name
Job  At his fate those of the west are shocked and those of the east are overcome with fear
Job  Truly these are the houses of the sinner and this is the place of him who has no knowledge of God
Job  And Job made answer and said
Job  How long will you make my life bitter crushing me with words
Job  Ten times now you have made sport of me it gives you no sense of shame to do me wrong
Job  And truly if I have been in error the effect of my error is only on myself
Job  If you make yourselves great against me using my punishment as an argument against me
Job  Be certain that it is God who has done me wrong and has taken me in his net
Job  Truly I make an outcry against the violent man but there is no answer I give a cry for help but no one takes up my cause
Job  My way is walled up by him so that I may not go by he has made my roads dark
Job  He has put off my glory from me and taken the crown from my head
Job  I am broken down by him on every side and I am gone my hope is uprooted like a tree
Job  His wrath is burning against me and I am to him as one of his haters
Job  His armies come on together they make their road high against me and put up their tents round mine
Job  He has taken my brothers far away from me they have seen my fate and have become strange to me
Job  My relations and my near friends have given me up and those living in my house have put me out of their minds
Job  I am strange to my womenservants and seem to them as one from another country
Job  At my cry my servant gives me no answer and I have to make a prayer to him
Job  My breath is strange to my wife and I am disgusting to the offspring of my mothers body
Job  Even young children have no respect for me when I get up their backs are turned on me
Job  All the men of my circle keep away from me and those dear to me are turned against me
Job  My bones are joined to my skin and I have got away with my flesh in my teeth
Job  Have pity on me have pity on me O my friends for the hand of God is on me
Job  Why are you cruel to me like God for ever saying evil against me
Job  If only my words might be recorded if they might be put in writing in a book
Job  And with an iron pen and lead be cut into the rock for ever
Job  But I am certain that he who will take up my cause is living and that in time to come he will take his place on the dust
Job  And  without my flesh I will see God
Job  Whom I will see on my side and not as one strange to me My heart is broken with desire
Job  If you say How cruel we will be to him because the root of sin is clearly in him
Job  Be in fear of the sword for the sword is the punishment for such things so that you may be certain that there is a judge
Job  Then Zophar the Naamathite made answer and said
Job  For this cause my thoughts are troubling me and driving me on
Job  I have to give ear to arguments which put me to shame and your answers to me are wind without wisdom
Job  Have you knowledge of this from early times when man was placed on the earth
Job  That the pride of the sinner is short and the joy of the evildoer but for a minute
Job  Though he is lifted up to the heavens and his head goes up to the clouds
Job  Like the waste from his body he comes to an end for ever those who have seen him say Where is he
Job  He is gone like a dream and is not seen again he goes in flight like a vision of the night
Job  The eye which saw him sees him no longer and his place has no more knowledge of him
Job  His children are hoping that the poor will be kind to them and his hands give back his wealth
Job  His bones are full of young strength but it will go down with him into the dust
Job  Though evildoing is sweet in his mouth and he keeps it secretly under his tongue
Job  Though he takes care of it and does not let it go but keeps it still in his mouth
Job  His food becomes bitter in his stomach the poison of snakes is inside him
Job  He takes down wealth as food and sends it up again it is forced out of his stomach by God
Job  He takes the poison of snakes into his mouth the tongue of the snake is the cause of his death
Job  Let him not see the rivers of oil the streams of honey and milk
Job  He is forced to give back the fruit of his work and may not take it for food he has no joy in the profit of his trading
Job  Because he has been cruel to the poor turning away from them in their trouble because he has taken a house by force which he did not put up
Job  There is no peace for him in his wealth and no salvation for him in those things in which he took delight
Job  He had never enough for his desire for this cause his wellbeing will quickly come to an end
Job  Even when his wealth is great he is full of care for the hand of everyone who is in trouble is turned against him
Job  God gives him his desire and sends the heat of his wrath on him making it come down on him like rain
Job  He may go in flight from the iron spear but the arrow from the bow of brass will go through him
Job  He is pulling it out and it comes out of his back and its shining point comes out of his side he is overcome by fears
Job  All his wealth is stored up for the dark a fire not made by man sends destruction on him and on everything in his tent
Job  The heavens make clear his sin and the earth gives witness against him
Job  The produce of his house is taken away into another country like things given into the hands of others in the day of wrath
Job  This is the reward of the evil man and the heritage given to him by God
Job  Then Job made answer and said
Job  Give attention with care to my words and let this be your comfort
Job  Let me say what is in my mind and after that go on making sport of me
Job  As for me is my outcry against man is it then to be wondered at if my spirit is troubled
Job  Take note of me and be full of wonder put your hand on your mouth
Job  At the very thought of it my flesh is shaking with fear
Job  Why is life given to the evildoers why do they become old and strong in power
Job  Their children are ever with them and their offspring before their eyes
Job  Their houses are free from fear and the rod of God does not come on them
Job  Their ox is ready at all times to give seed their cow gives birth without dropping her young
Job  They send out their young ones like a flock and their children have pleasure in the dance
Job  They make songs to the instruments of music and are glad at the sound of the pipe
Job  Their days come to an end without trouble and suddenly they go down to the underworld
Job  Though they said to God Go away from us for we have no desire for the knowledge of your ways
Job  What is the Ruler of all that we may give him worship and what profit is it to us to make prayer to him
Job  Truly is not their wellbeing in their power The purpose of the evildoers is far from me
Job  How frequently is the light of the evildoers put out or does trouble come on them how frequently does his wrath take them with cords
Job  How frequently are they as dry stems before the wind or as grass taken away by the stormwind
Job  You say God keeps punishment stored up for his children Let him send it on the man himself so that he may have the punishment of it
Job  Let his eyes see his trouble and let him be full of the wrath of the Ruler of all
Job  For what interest has he in his house after him when the number of his months is ended
Job  Is anyone able to give teaching to God for he is the judge of those who are on high
Job  One comes to his end in complete wellbeing full of peace and quiet
Job  His buckets are full of milk and there is no loss of strength in his bones
Job  And another comes to his end with a bitter soul without ever tasting good
Job  Together they go down to the dust and are covered by the worm
Job  See I am conscious of your thoughts and of your violent purposes against me
Job  For you say Where is the house of the ruler and where is the tent of the evildoer
Job  Have you not put the question to the travellers and do you not take note of their experience
Job  How the evil man goes free in the day of trouble and has salvation in the day of wrath
Job  Who will make his way clear to his face and if he has done a thing who gives him punishment for it
Job  He is taken to his last restingplace and keeps watch over it
Job  The earth of the valley covering his bones is sweet to him and all men come after him as there were unnumbered before him
Job  Why then do you give me comfort with words in which there is no profit when you see that there is nothing in your answers but deceit
Job  Then Eliphaz the Temanite made answer and said
Job  Is it possible for a man to be of profit to God No for a mans wisdom is only of profit to himself
Job  Is it of any interest to the Ruler of all that you are upright or is it of use to him that your ways are without sin
Job  Is it because you give him honour that he is sending punishment on you and is judging you
Job  Is not your evildoing great and there is no end to your sins
Job  For you have taken your brothers goods when he was not in your debt and have taken away the clothing of those who have need of it
Job  You do not give water to the tired traveller and from him who has no food you keep back bread
Job  For it was the man with power who had the land and the man with an honoured name who was living in it
Job  You have sent widows away without hearing their cause and you have taken away the support of the child who has no father
Job  For this cause nets are round your feet and you are overcome with sudden fear
Job  Your light is made dark so that you are unable to see and you are covered by a mass of waters
Job  Is not God as high as heaven and see the stars how high they are
Job  And you say What knowledge has God is he able to give decisions through the deep dark
Job  Thick clouds are covering him so that he is unable to see and he is walking on the arch of heaven
Job  Will you keep the old way by which evil men went
Job  Who were violently taken away before their time who were overcome by the rush of waters
Job  Who said to God Go away from us and What is the Ruler of all able to do to us
Job  Though he made their houses full of good things but the purpose of the evildoers is far from me
Job  The upright saw it and were glad and those who had done no wrong made sport of them
Job  Saying Truly their substance is cut off and their wealth is food for the fire
Job  Put yourself now in a right relation with him and be at peace so will you do well in your undertakings
Job  Be pleased to take teaching from his mouth and let his words be stored up in your heart
Job  If you come back to the Ruler of all making yourself low before him if you put evil far away from your tents
Job  And put your gold in the dust even your gold of Ophir among the rocks of the valleys
Job  Then the Ruler of all will be your gold and his teaching will be your silver
Job  For then you will have delight in the Ruler of all and your face will be lifted up to God
Job  You will make your prayer to him and be answered and you will give effect to your oaths
Job  Your purposes will come about and light will be shining on your ways
Job  For God makes low those whose hearts are lifted up but he is a saviour to the poor in spirit
Job  He makes safe the man who is free from sin and if your hands are clean salvation will be yours
Job  And Job made answer and said
Job  Even today my outcry is bitter his hand is hard on my sorrow
Job  If only I had knowledge of where he might be seen so that I might come even to his seat
Job  I would put my cause in order before him and my mouth would be full of arguments
Job  I would see what his answers would be and have knowledge of what he would say to me
Job  Would he make use of his great power to overcome me No but he would give attention to me
Job  There an upright man might put his cause before him and I would be free for ever from my judge
Job  See I go forward but he is not there and back but I do not see him
Job  I am looking for him on the left hand but there is no sign of him and turning to the right I am not able to see him
Job  For he has knowledge of the way I take after I have been tested I will come out like gold
Job  My feet have gone in his steps I have kept in his way without turning to one side or to the other
Job  I have never gone against the orders of his lips the words of his mouth have been stored up in my heart
Job  But his purpose is fixed and there is no changing it and he gives effect to the desire of his soul
Job  For what has been ordered for me by him will be gone through to the end and his mind is full of such designs
Job  For this cause I am in fear before him my thoughts of him overcome me
Job  For God has made my heart feeble and my mind is troubled before the Ruler of all
Job  For I am overcome by the dark and by the black night which is covering my face
Job  Why are times not stored up by the Ruler of all and why do those who have knowledge of him not see his days
Job  The landmarks are changed by evil men they violently take away flocks together with their keepers
Job  They send away the ass of him who has no father they take the widows ox for debt
Job  The crushed are turned out of the way all the poor of the earth go into a secret place together
Job  Like asses in the waste land they go out to their work looking for food with care from the waste land they get bread for their children
Job  They get mixed grain from the field and they take away the late fruit from the vines of those who have wealth
Job  They take their rest at night without clothing and have no cover in the cold
Job  They are wet with the rain of the mountains and get into the cracks of the rock for cover
Job  The child without a father is forced from its mothers breast and they take the young children of the poor for debt
Job  Others go about without clothing and though they have no food they get in the grain from the fields
Job  Between the lines of olivetrees they make oil though they have no drink they are crushing out the grapes
Job  From the town come sounds of pain from those who are near death and the soul of the wounded is crying out for help but God does not take note of their prayer
Job  Then there are those who are haters of the light who have no knowledge of its ways and do not go in them
Job  He who is purposing death gets up before day so that he may put to death the poor and those in need
Job  And the man whose desire is for the wife of another is waiting for the evening saying No eye will see me and he puts a cover on his face And in the night the thief goes about
Job  In the dark he makes holes in the walls of houses in the daytime they are shutting themselves up they have no knowledge of the light
Job  For the middle of the night is as morning to them they are not troubled by the fear of the dark
Job  They go quickly on the face of the waters their heritage is cursed in the earth the steps of the crusher of grapes are not turned to their vinegarden
Job  Snow waters become dry with the heat so do sinners go down into the underworld
Job  The public place of his town has no more knowledge of him and his name has gone from the memory of men he is rooted up like a dead tree
Job  He is not kind to the widow and he has no pity for her child
Job  But God by his power gives long life to the strong he gets up again though he has no hope of life
Job  He takes away his fear of danger and gives him support and his eyes are on his ways
Job  For a short time they are lifted up then they are gone they are made low they are pulled off like fruit and like the heads of grain they are cut off
Job  And if it is not so now who will make it clear that my words are false and that what I say is of no value
Job  Then Bildad the Shuhite made answer and said
Job  Rule and power are his he makes peace in his high places
Job  Is it possible for his armies to be numbered and on whom is not his light shining
Job  How then is it possible for man to be upright before God or how may he be clean who is a son of woman
Job  See even the moon is not bright and the stars are not clean in his eyes
Job  How much less man who is an insect and the son of man who is a worm
Job  Then Job made answer and said
Job  How have you given help to him who has no power how have you been the salvation of the arm which has no strength
Job  How have you given teaching to him who has no wisdom and fully made clear true knowledge
Job  To whom have your words been said and whose spirit came out from you
Job  The shades in the underworld are shaking the waters and those living in them
Job  The underworld is uncovered before him and Destruction has no veil
Job  By his hand the north is stretched out in space and the earth is hanging on nothing
Job  By him the waters are shut up in his thick clouds and the cloud does not give way under them
Job  By him the face of his high seat is veiled and his cloud stretched out over it
Job  By him a circle is marked out on the face of the waters to the limits of the light and the dark
Job  The pillars of heaven are shaking and are overcome by his sharp words
Job  By his power the sea was made quiet and by his wisdom Rahab was wounded
Job  By his wind the heavens become bright by his hand the quickly moving snake was cut through
Job  See these are only the outskirts of his ways and how small is that which comes to our ears about him But the thunder of his acts of power is outside all knowledge
Job  And Job again took up the word and said
Job  By the life of God who has taken away my right and of the Ruler of all who has made my soul bitter
Job  For all my breath is still in me and the spirit of God is my life
Job  Truly there is no deceit in my lips and my tongue does not say what is false
Job  Let it be far from me I will certainly not say that you are right I will come to death before I give up my righteousness
Job  I will keep it safe and will not let it go my heart has nothing to say against any part of my life
Job  Let my hater be like the evil man and let him who comes against me be as the sinner
Job  For what is the hope of the sinner when he is cut off when God takes back his soul
Job  Will his cry come to the ears of God when he is in trouble
Job  Will he take delight in the Ruler of all and make his prayer to God at all times
Job  I will give you teaching about the hand of God I will not keep secret from you what is in the mind of the Ruler of all
Job  Truly you have all seen it yourselves why then have you become completely foolish
Job  This is the punishment of the evildoer from God and the heritage given to the cruel by the Ruler of all
Job  If his children are increased it is for the sword and his offspring have not enough bread
Job  When those of his house who are still living come to their end by disease they are not put into the earth and their widows are not weeping for them
Job  Though he may get silver together like dust and make ready great stores of clothing
Job  He may get them ready but the upright will put them on and he who is free from sin will take the silver for a heritage
Job  His house has no more strength than a spiders thread or a watchmans tent
Job  He goes to rest full of wealth but does so for the last time on opening his eyes he sees it there no longer
Job  Fears overtake him like rushing waters in the night the stormwind takes him away
Job  The east wind takes him up and he is gone he is forced violently out of his place
Job  God sends his arrows against him without mercy he goes in flight before his hand
Job  Men make signs of joy because of him driving him from his place with sounds of hissing
Job  Truly there is a mine for silver and a place where gold is washed out
Job  Iron is taken out of the earth and stone is changed into brass by the fire
Job  Man puts an end to the dark searching out to the farthest limit the stones of the deep places of the dark
Job  He makes a deep mine far away from those living in the light of day when they go about on the earth they have no knowledge of those who are under them who are hanging far from men twisting from side to side on a cord
Job  As for the earth bread comes out of it but under its face it is turned up as if by fire
Job  Its stones are the place of sapphires and it has dust of gold
Job  No bird has knowledge of it and the hawks eye has never seen it
Job  The great beasts have not gone over it and the cruel lion has not taken that way
Job  Man puts out his hand on the hard rock overturning mountains by the roots
Job  He makes deep ways cut through the rock and his eye sees everything of value
Job  He keeps back the streams from flowing and makes the secret things come out into the light
Job  But where may wisdom be seen and where is the restingplace of knowledge
Job  Man has not seen the way to it and it is not in the land of the living
Job  The deep waters say It is not in me and the sea says It is not with me
Job  Gold may not be given for it or a weight of silver in payment for it
Job  It may not be valued with the gold of Ophir with the onyx of great price or the sapphire
Job  Gold and glass are not equal to it in price and it may not be exchanged for jewels of the best gold
Job  There is no need to say anything about coral or crystal and the value of wisdom is greater than that of pearls
Job  The topaz of Ethiopia is not equal to it and it may not be valued with the best gold
Job  From where then does wisdom come and where is the restingplace of knowledge
Job  For it is kept secret from the eyes of all living unseen by the birds of the air
Job  Destruction and Death say We have only had word of it with our ears
Job  God has knowledge of the way to it and of its restingplace
Job  For his eyes go to the ends of the earth and he sees everything under heaven
Job  When he made a weight for the wind measuring out the waters
Job  When he made a law for the rain and a way for the thunderflames
Job  Then he saw it and put it on record he gave it its fixed form searching it out completely
Job  And he said to man Truly the fear of the Lord is wisdom and to keep from evil is the way to knowledge
Job  And Job again took up the word and said
Job  If only I might again be as I was in the months which are past in the days when God was watching over me
Job  When his light was shining over my head and when I went through the dark by his light
Job  As I was in my flowering years when my tent was covered by the hand of God
Job  While the Ruler of all was still with me and my children were round me
Job  When my steps were washed with milk and rivers of oil were flowing out of the rock for me
Job  When I went out of my door to go up to the town and took my seat in the public place
Job  The young men saw me and went away and the old men got up from their seats
Job  The rulers kept quiet and put their hands on their mouths
Job  The chiefs kept back their words and their tongues were joined to the roofs of their mouths
Job  For when it came to their ears men said that I was truly happy and when their eyes saw they gave witness to me
Job  For I was a saviour to the poor when he was crying for help to the child with no father and to him who had no supporter
Job  The blessing of him who was near to destruction came on me and I put a song of joy into the widows heart
Job  I put on righteousness as my clothing and was full of it right decisions were to me a robe and a headdress
Job  I was eyes to the blind and feet to him who had no power of walking
Job  I was a father to the poor searching out the cause of him who was strange to me
Job  By me the great teeth of the evildoer were broken and I made him give up what he had violently taken away
Job  Then I said I will come to my end with my children round me my days will be as the sand in number
Job  My root will be open to the waters and the night mist will be on my branches
Job  My glory will be ever new and my bow will be readily bent in my hand
Job  Men gave ear to me waiting and keeping quiet for my suggestions
Job  After I had said what was in my mind they were quiet and let my words go deep into their hearts
Job  They were waiting for me as for the rain opening their mouths wide as for the spring rains
Job  I was laughing at them when they had no hope and the light of my face was never clouded by their fear
Job  I took my place as a chief guiding them on their way and I was as a king among his army 
Job  But now those who are younger than I make sport of me those whose fathers I would not have put with the dogs of my flocks
Job  Of what use is the strength of their hands to me all force is gone from them
Job  They are wasted for need of food biting the dry earth their only hope of life is in the waste land
Job  They are pulling off the salt leaves from the brushwood and making a meal of roots
Job  They are sent out from among their townsmen men are crying after them as thieves
Job  They have to get a restingplace in the hollows of the valleys in holes of the earth and rocks
Job  They make noises like asses among the brushwood they get together under the thorns
Job  They are sons of shame and of men without a name who have been forced out of the land
Job  And now I have become their song and I am a word of shame to them
Job  I am disgusting to them they keep away from me and put marks of shame on me
Job  For he has made loose the cord of my bow and put me to shame he has sent down my flag to the earth before me
Job  The lines of his men of war put themselves in order and make high their ways of destruction against me
Job  They have made waste my roads with a view to my destruction his bowmen come round about me
Job  As through a wide broken place in the wall they come on I am overturned by the shock of their attack
Job  Fears have come on me my hope is gone like the wind and my wellbeing like a cloud
Job  But now my soul is turned to water in me days of trouble overtake me
Job  The flesh is gone from my bones and they give me no rest there is no end to my pains
Job  With great force he takes a grip of my clothing pulling me by the neck of my coat
Job  Truly God has made me low even to the earth and I have become like dust
Job  You give no answer to my cry and take no note of my prayer
Job  You have become cruel to me the strength of your hand is hard on me
Job  Lifting me up you make me go on the wings of the wind I am broken up by the storm
Job  For I am certain that you will send me back to death and to the meetingplace ordered for all living
Job  Has not my hand been stretched out in help to the poor have I not been a saviour to him in his trouble
Job  Have I not been weeping for the crushed and was not my soul sad for him who was in need
Job  For I was looking for good and evil came I was waiting for light and it became dark
Job  My feelings are strongly moved and give me no rest days of trouble have overtaken me
Job  I go about in dark clothing uncomforted I get up in the public place crying out for help
Job  I have become a brother to the jackals and go about in the company of ostriches
Job  My skin is black and dropping off me and my bones are burning with the heat of my disease
Job  And my music has been turned to sorrow and the sound of my pipe into the noise of weeping
Job  I made an agreement with my eyes how then might my eyes be looking on a virgin
Job  For what is Gods reward from on high or the heritage given by the Ruler of all from heaven
Job  Is it not trouble for the sinner and destruction for the evildoers
Job  Does he not see my ways and are not my steps all numbered
Job  If I have gone in false ways or my foot has been quick in working deceit
Job  Let me be measured in upright scales and let God see my righteousness
Job  If my steps have been turned out of the way or if my heart went after my eyes or if the property of another is in my hands
Job  Let me put seed in the earth for another to have the fruit of it and let my produce be uprooted
Job  If my heart went after another mans wife or if I was waiting secretly at my neighbours door
Job  Then let my wife give pleasure to another man and let others make use of her body
Job  For that would be a crime it would be an act for which punishment would be measured out by the judges
Job  It would be a fire burning even to destruction and taking away all my produce
Job  If I did wrong in the cause of my manservant or my womanservant when they went to law with me
Job  What then will I do when God comes as my judge and what answer may I give to his questions
Job  Did not God make him as well as me did he not give us life in our mothers bodies
Job  If I kept back the desire of the poor if the widows eye was looking for help to no purpose
Job  If I kept my food for myself and did not give some of it to the child with no father
Job  For I was cared for by God as by a father from my earliest days he was my guide from the body of my mother
Job  If I saw one near to death for need of clothing and that the poor had nothing covering him
Job  If his back did not give me a blessing and the wool of my sheep did not make him warm
Job  If my hand had been lifted up against him who had done no wrong when I saw that I was supported by the judges
Job  May my arm be pulled from my body and be broken from its base
Job  For the fear of God kept me back and because of his power I might not do such things
Job  If I made gold my hope or if I ever said to the best gold I have put my faith in you
Job  If I was glad because my wealth was great and because my hand had got together a great store
Job  If when I saw the sun shining and the moon moving on its bright way
Job  A secret feeling of worship came into my heart and my hand gave kisses from my mouth
Job  That would have been another sin to be rewarded with punishment by the judges for I would have been false to God on high
Job  If I was glad at the trouble of my hater and gave cries of joy when evil overtook him
Job  For I did not let my mouth give way to sin in putting a curse on his life
Job  If the men of my tent did not say Who has not had full measure of his meat
Job  The traveller did not take his nights rest in the street and my doors were open to anyone on a journey
Job  If I kept my evil doings covered and my sin in the secret of my breast
Job  For fear of the great body of people or for fear that families might make sport of me so that I kept quiet and did not go out of my door
Job  If only God would give ear to me and the Ruler of all would give me an answer or if what he has against me had been put in writing
Job  Truly I would take up the book in my hands it would be to me as a crown
Job  I would make clear the number of my steps I would put it before him like a prince The words of Job are ended
Job  If my land has made an outcry against me or the ploughed earth has been in sorrow
Job  If I have taken its produce without payment causing the death of its owners
Job  Then in place of grain let thorns come up and in place of barley evilsmelling plants
Job  So these three men gave no more answers to Job because he seemed to himself to be right
Job  And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite of the family of Ram was angry burning with wrath against Job because he seemed to himself more right than God
Job  And he was angry with his three friends because they had been unable to give him an answer and had not made Jobs sin clear
Job  Now Elihu had kept quiet while Job was talking because they were older than he
Job  And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men he was very angry
Job  And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite made answer and said I am young and you are very old so I was in fear and kept myself from putting my knowledge before you
Job  I said to myself It is right for the old to say what is in their minds and for those who are far on in years to give out wisdom
Job  But truly it is the spirit in man even the breath of the Ruler of all which gives them knowledge
Job  It is not the old who are wise and those who are full of years have not the knowledge of what is right
Job  So I say Give ear to me and I will put forward my knowledge
Job  I was waiting for your words I was giving ear to your wise sayings while you were searching out what to say
Job  I was taking note and truly not one of you was able to make clear Jobs error or to give an answer to his words
Job  Take care that you do not say Wisdom is here God may overcome him but not man
Job  I will not put forward words like these or make use of your sayings in answer to him
Job  Fear has overcome them they have no more answers to give they have come to an end of words
Job  And am I to go on waiting while they have nothing to say while they keep quiet and give no more answers
Job  I will give my answer I will put forward my knowledge
Job  For I am full of words I am unable to keep in my breath any longer
Job  My stomach is like wine which is unable to get out like skins full of new wine it is almost burst
Job  Let me say what is in my mind so that I may get comfort let me give answer with open mouth
Job  Let me not give respect to any man or give names of honour to any living
Job  For I am not able to give names of honour to any man and if I did my Maker would quickly take me away
Job  And now O Job give ear to my words and take note of all I say
Job  See now my mouth is open my tongue gives out words
Job  My heart is overflowing with knowledge my lips say what is true
Job  The spirit of God has made me and the breath of the Ruler of all gives me life
Job  If you are able give me an answer put your cause in order and come forward
Job  See I am the same as you are in the eyes of God I was cut off from the same bit of wet earth
Job  Fear of me will not overcome you and my hand will not be hard on you
Job  But you said in my hearing and your voice came to my ears
Job  I am clean without sin I am washed and there is no evil in me
Job  See he is looking for something against me in his eyes I am as one of his haters
Job  He puts chains on my feet he is watching all my ways
Job  Truly in saying this you are wrong for God is greater than man
Job  Why do you put forward your cause against him saying He gives no answer to any of my words
Job  For God gives his word in one way even in two and man is not conscious of it
Job  In a dream in a vision of the night when deep sleep comes on men while they take their rest on their beds
Job  Then he makes his secrets clear to men so that they are full of fear at what they see
Job  In order that man may be turned from his evil works and that pride may be taken away from him
Job  To keep back his soul from the underworld and his life from destruction
Job  Pain is sent on him as a punishment while he is on his bed there is no end to the trouble in his bones
Job  He has no desire for food and his soul is turned away from delicate meat
Job  His flesh is so wasted away that it may not be seen and his bones 
Job  And his soul comes near to the underworld and his life to the angels of death
Job  If now there may be an angel sent to him one of the thousands which there are to be between him and God and to make clear to man what is right for him
Job  And if he has mercy on him and says Let him not go down to the underworld I have given the price for his life
Job  Then his flesh becomes young again and he comes back to the days of his early strength
Job  He makes his prayer to God and he has mercy on him he sees Gods face with cries of joy he gives news of his righteousness to men
Job  He makes a song saying I did wrong turning from the straight way but he did not give me the reward of my sin
Job  He kept my soul from the underworld and my life sees the light in full measure
Job  Truly God does all these things to man twice and three times
Job  Keeping back his soul from the underworld so that he may see the light of life
Job  Take note O Job give ear to me keep quiet while I say what is in my mind
Job  If you have anything to say give me an answer for it is my desire that you may be judged free from sin
Job  If not give attention to me and keep quiet and I will give you wisdom
Job  And Elihu made answer and said
Job  Give ear you wise to my words and you who have knowledge give attention to me
Job  For words are tested by the ear as food is tasted by the mouth
Job  Let us make the decision for ourselves as to what is right let us have the knowledge among ourselves of what is good
Job  For Job has said I am upright and it is God who has taken away my right
Job  Though I am right still I am in pain my wound may not be made well though I have done no wrong
Job  What man is like Job a man who freely makes sport of God
Job  And goes in the company of evildoers walking in the way of sinners
Job  For he has said It is no profit to a man to take delight in God
Job  Now then you wise take note you men of knowledge give ear to me Let it be far from God to do evil and from the Ruler of all to do wrong
Job  For he gives to every man the reward of his work and sees that he gets the fruit of his ways
Job  Truly God does not do evil and the Ruler of all is not a false judge
Job  Who put the earth into his care or made him responsible for the world
Job  If he made his spirit come back to him taking his breath into himself again
Job  All flesh would come to an end together and man would go back to the dust
Job  If you are wise take note of this give ear to the voice of my words
Job  How may a hater of right be a ruler and will you say that the upright Ruler of all is evil
Job  He who says to a king You are an evildoer and to rulers You are sinners
Job  Who has no respect for rulers and who gives no more attention to those who have wealth than to the poor for they are all the work of his hands
Job  Suddenly they come to an end even in the middle of the night the blow comes on the men of wealth and they are gone and the strong are taken away without the hand of man
Job  For his eyes are on the ways of a man and he sees all his steps
Job  There is no dark place and no thick cloud in which the workers of evil may take cover
Job  For he does not give man a fixed time to come before him to be judged
Job  He sends the strong to destruction without searching out their cause and puts others in their place
Job  For he has knowledge of their works overturning them in the night so that they are crushed
Job  The evildoers are broken by his wrath he puts his hand on them with force before the eyes of all onlookers
Job  Because they did not go after him and took no note of his ways
Job  So that the cry of the poor might come up to him and the prayer of those in need come to his ears
Job

Job  
Job  Men of knowledge and all wise men hearing me will say
Job  Jobs words do not come from knowledge they are not the fruit of wisdom
Job  May Job be tested to the end because his answers have been like those of evil men
Job  For in addition to his sin he is uncontrolled in heart before our eyes he makes sport of God increasing his words against him
Job  And Elihu made answer and said
Job  Does it seem to you to be right and righteousness before God to say
Job  What profit is it to me and how am I better off than if I had done wrong
Job  I will make answer to you and to your friends
Job  Let your eyes be turned to the heavens and lifted up to see the skies they are higher than you
Job  If you have done wrong is he any the worse for it and if your sins are great in number what is it to him
Job  If you are upright what do you give to him or what does he take from your hand
Job  Your evildoing may have an effect on a man like yourself or your righteousness on a son of man
Job  Because the hand of the cruel is hard on them men are making sounds of grief they are crying out for help because of the arm of the strong
Job  But no one has said Where is God my Maker who gives songs in the night
Job  Who gives us more knowledge than the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the heaven
Job  There they are crying out because of the pride of the evildoers but he gives them no answer
Job  But God will not give ear to what is false or the Ruler of all take note of it
Job  How much less when you say that you do not see him that the cause is before him and you are waiting for him
Job  And now  
Job  And Jobs mouth is open wide to give out what is of no profit increasing words without knowledge
Job  And Elihu went on to say
Job  Give me a little more time and I will make it clear to you for I have still something to say for God
Job  I will get my knowledge from far and I will give righteousness to my Maker
Job  For truly my words are not false one who has all knowledge is talking with you
Job  Truly God gives up the hardhearted and will not give life to the sinner
Job  His eyes are ever on the upright and he gives to the crushed their right
Job  Lifting them up to the seat of kings and making them safe for ever
Job  And if they have been prisoned in chains and taken in cords of trouble
Job  Then he makes clear to them what they have done even their evil works in which they have taken pride
Job  Their ear is open to his teaching and he gives them orders so that their hearts may be turned from evil
Job  If they give ear to his voice and do his word then he gives them long life and years full of pleasure
Job  But if not they come to their end and give up their breath without knowledge
Job  Those who have no fear of God keep wrath stored up in their hearts they give no cry for help when they are made prisoners
Job  They come to their end while they are still young their life is short like that of those who are used for sex purposes in the worship of their gods
Job  He makes the wrong done to the poor the way of their salvation opening their ears by their trouble
Job  
Job  
Job  
Job  
Job  
Job  Take care not to be turned to sin for you have taken evil for your part in place of sorrow
Job  Truly God is lifted up in strength who is a ruler like him
Job  Who ever gave orders to him or said to him You have done wrong
Job  See that you give praise to his work about which men make songs
Job  All people are looking on it man sees it from far
Job  Truly God is great greater than all our knowledge the number of his years may not be searched out
Job  For he takes up the drops from the sea he sends them through his mist as rain
Job  Flowing down from the sky and dropping on the peoples
Job  And who has knowledge of how the clouds are stretched out or of the thunders of his tent
Job  See he is stretching out his mist covering the tops of the mountains with it
Job  For by these he gives food to the peoples and bread in full measure
Job  He takes the light in his hands sending it against the mark
Job  The thunder makes clear his passion and the storm gives news of his wrath
Job  At this my heart is shaking it is moved out of its place
Job  Give ear to the rolling noise of his voice to the hollow sound which goes out of his mouth
Job  He sends it out through all the heaven and his thunderflame to the ends of the earth
Job  After it a voice is sounding thundering out the word of his power he does not keep back his thunderflames from his mouth his voice is sounding
Job  He does wonders more than may be searched out great things of which we have no knowledge
Job  For he says to the snow Make the earth wet and to the rainstorm Come down
Job  He puts an end to the work of every man so that all may see his work
Job  Then the beasts go into their holes and take their rest
Job  Out of its place comes the stormwind and the cold out of its storehouses
Job  By the breath of God ice is made and the wide waters are shut in
Job  The thick cloud is weighted with thunderflame and the cloud sends out its light
Job  And it goes this way and that round about turning itself by his guiding to do whatever he gives orders to be done on the face of his world of men
Job  For a rod or for a curse or for mercy causing it to come on the mark
Job  Give ear to this O Job and keep quiet in your place and take note of the wonders worked by God
Job  Have you knowledge of Gods ordering of his works how he makes the light of his cloud to be seen
Job  Have you knowledge of the balancings of the clouds the wonders of him who has all wisdom
Job  You whose clothing is warm when the earth is quiet because of the south wind
Job  Will you with him make the skies smooth and strong as a polished lookingglass
Job  Make clear to me what we are to say to him we are unable to put our cause before him because of the dark
Job  How may he have knowledge of my desire for talk with him or did any man ever say May destruction come on me
Job  And now the light is not seen for it is dark because of the clouds but a wind comes clearing them away
Job  A bright light comes out of the north Gods glory is greatly to be feared
Job  There is no searching out of the Ruler of all his strength and his judging are great he is full of righteousness doing no wrong
Job  For this cause men go in fear of him he has no respect for any who are wise in heart
Job  And the Lord made answer to Job out of the stormwind and said
Job  Who is this who makes the purpose of God dark by words without knowledge
Job  Get your strength together like a man of war I will put questions to you and you will give me the answers
Job  Where were you when I put the earth on its base Say if you have knowledge
Job  By whom were its measures fixed Say if you have wisdom or by whom was the line stretched out over it
Job  On what were its pillars based or who put down its anglestone
Job  When the morning stars made songs together and all the sons of the gods gave cries of joy
Job  Or where were you when the sea came to birth pushing out from its secret place
Job  When I made the cloud its robe and put thick clouds as bands round it
Job  Ordering a fixed limit for it with locks and doors
Job  And said So far you may come and no farther and here the pride of your waves will be stopped
Job  Have you from your earliest days given orders to the morning or made the dawn conscious of its place
Job  So that it might take a grip of the skirts of the earth shaking all the evildoers out of it
Job  It is changed like wet earth under a stamp and is coloured like a robe
Job  And from the evildoers their light is kept back and the arm of pride is broken
Job  Have you come into the springs of the sea walking in the secret places of the deep
Job  Have the doors of death been open to you or have the doorkeepers of the dark ever seen you
Job  Have you taken note of the wide limits of the earth Say if you have knowledge of it all
Job  Which is the way to the restingplace of the light and where is the storehouse of the dark
Job  So that you might take it to its limit guiding it to its house
Job  No doubt you have knowledge of it for then you had come to birth and the number of your days is great
Job  Have you come into the secret place of snow or have you seen the storehouses of the icedrops
Job  Which I have kept for the time of trouble for the day of war and fighting
Job  Which is the way to the place where the wind is measured out and the east wind sent out over the earth
Job  By whom has the way been cut for the flowing of the rain and the flaming of the thunder
Job  Causing rain to come on a land where no man is living on the waste land which has no people
Job  To give water to the land where there is waste and destruction and to make the dry land green with young grass
Job  Has the rain a father or who gave birth to the drops of night mist
Job  Out of whose body came the ice and who gave birth to the cold mist of heaven
Job  The waters are joined together hard as a stone and the face of the deep is covered
Job  Are the bands of the Pleiades fixed by you or are the cords of Orion made loose
Job  Do you make Mazzaroth come out in its right time or are the Bear and its children guided by you
Job  Have you knowledge of the laws of the heavens did you give them rule over the earth
Job  Is your voice sent up to the cloud so that you may be covered by the weight of waters
Job  Do you send out the thunderflames so that they may go and say to you Here we are
Job  Who has put wisdom in the high clouds or given knowledge to the lights of the north
Job  By whose wisdom are the clouds numbered or the waterskins of the heavens turned to the earth
Job  When the earth becomes hard as metal and is joined together in masses
Job  Do you go after food for the shelion or get meat so that the young lions may have enough
Job  When they are stretched out in their holes and are waiting in the brushwood
Job  Who gives in the evening the meat he is searching for when his young ones are crying to God when the young lions with loud noise go wandering after their food
Job  Have you knowledge of the rockgoats or do you see the roes giving birth to their young
Job  Is the number of their months fixed by you or is the time when they give birth ordered by you
Job  They are bent down they give birth to their young they let loose the fruit of their body
Job  Their young ones are strong living in the open country they go out and do not come back again
Job  Who has let the ass of the fields go free or made loose the bands of the loudvoiced beast
Job  To whom I have given the waste land for a heritage and the salt land as a livingplace
Job  He makes sport of the noise of the town the voice of the driver does not come to his ears
Job  He goes looking for his grasslands in the mountains searching out every green thing
Job  Will the ox of the mountains be your servant or is his nights restingplace by your foodstore
Job  Will he be pulling your plough with cords turning up the valleys after you
Job  Will you put your faith in him because his strength is great will you give the fruit of your work into his care
Job  Will you be looking for him to come back and get in your seed to the crushingfloor
Job  Is the wing of the ostrich feeble or is it because she has no feathers
Job  That she puts her eggs on the earth warming them in the dust
Job  Without a thought that they may be crushed by the foot and broken by the beasts of the field
Job  She is cruel to her young ones as if they were not hers her work is to no purpose she has no fear
Job  For God has taken wisdom from her mind and given her no measure of knowledge
Job  When she is shaking her wings on high she makes sport of the horse and of him who is seated on him
Job  Do you give strength to the horse is it by your hand that his neck is clothed with power
Job  Is it through you that he is shaking like a locust in the pride of his loudsounding breath
Job  He is stamping with joy in the valley he makes sport of fear
Job  In his strength he goes out against the arms of war turning not away from the sword
Job  The bow is sounding against him he sees the shining point of spear and arrow
Job  Shaking with passion he is biting the earth he is not able to keep quiet at the sound of the horn
Job  When it comes to his ears he says Aha He is smelling the fight from far off and hearing the thunder of the captains and the warcries
Job  Is it through your knowledge that the hawk takes his flight stretching out his wings to the south
Job  Or is it by your orders that the eagle goes up and makes his restingplace on high
Job  On the rock is his house and on the mountaintop his strong place
Job  From there he is watching for food his eye sees it far off
Job  His young have blood for their drink and where the dead bodies are there is he to be seen
Job  
Job  Will he who is protesting give teaching to the Ruler of all Let him who has arguments to put forward against God give an answer
Job  And Job said in answer to the Lord
Job  Truly I am of no value what answer may I give to you I will put my hand on my mouth
Job  I have said once and even twice what was in my mind but I will not do so again
Job  Then the Lord made answer to Job out of the stormwind and said
Job  Get your strength together like a man of war I will put questions to you and you will give me the answers
Job  Will you even make my right of no value will you say that I am wrong in order to make clear that you are right
Job  Have you an arm like God have you a voice of thunder like his
Job  Put on the ornaments of your pride be clothed with glory and power
Job  Let your wrath be overflowing let your eyes see all the sons of pride and make them low
Job  Send destruction on all who are lifted up pulling down the sinners from their places
Job  Let them be covered together in the dust let their faces be dark in the secret place of the underworld
Job  Then I will give praise to you saying that your right hand is able to give you salvation
Job  See now the Great Beast whom I made even as I made you he takes grass for food like the ox
Job  His strength is in his body and his force in the muscles of his stomach
Job  His tail is curving like a cedar the muscles of his legs are joined together
Job  His bones are pipes of brass his legs are like rods of iron
Job  He is the chief of the ways of God made by him for his pleasure
Job  He takes the produce of the mountains where all the beasts of the field are at play
Job  He takes his rest under the trees of the river and in the pool under the shade of the waterplants
Job  He is covered by the branches of the trees the grasses of the stream are round him
Job  Truly if the river is overflowing it gives him no cause for fear he has no sense of danger even if Jordan is rushing against his mouth
Job  Will anyone take him when he is on the watch or put metal teeth through his nose
Job  Is it possible for Leviathan to be pulled out with a fishhook or for a hook to be put through the bone of his mouth
Job  Will you put a cord into his nose or take him away with a cord round his tongue
Job  Will he make prayers to you or say soft words to you
Job  Will he make an agreement with you so that you may take him as a servant for ever
Job  Will you make sport with him as with a bird or put him in chains for your young women
Job  Will the fishermen make profit out of him will they have him cut up for the traders
Job  Will you put sharppointed irons into his skin or fishspears into his head
Job  Only put your hand on him and see what a fight you will have you will not do it again
Job  Truly the hope of his attacker is false he is overcome even on seeing him
Job  He is so cruel that no one is ready to go against him Who then is able to keep his place before me
Job  Who ever went against me and got the better of me There is no one under heaven
Job  I will not keep quiet about the parts of his body or about his power and the strength of his frame
Job  Who has ever taken off his outer skin who may come inside his inner coat of iron
Job  Who has made open the doors of his face Fear is round about his teeth
Job  His back is made of lines of plates joined tight together one against the other like a stamp
Job  One is so near to the other that no air may come between them
Job  They take a grip of one another they are joined together so that they may not be parted
Job  His sneezings give out flames and his eyes are like the eyes of the dawn
Job  Out of his mouth go burning lights and flames of fire are jumping up
Job  Smoke comes out of his nose like a pot boiling on the fire
Job  His breath puts fire to coals and a flame goes out of his mouth
Job  Strength is in his neck and fear goes dancing before him
Job  The plates of his flesh are joined together fixed and not to be moved
Job  His heart is as strong as a stone hard as the lower crushingstone
Job  When he gets ready for the fight the strong are overcome with fear
Job  The sword may come near him but is not able to go through him the spear or the arrow or the sharppointed iron
Job  Iron is to him as dry grass and brass as soft wood
Job  The arrow is not able to put him to flight stones are no more to him than dry stems
Job  A thick stick is no better than a leaf of grass and he makes sport of the onrush of the spear
Job  Under him are sharp edges of broken pots as if he was pulling a graincrushing instrument over the wet earth
Job  The deep is boiling like a pot of spices and the sea like a perfumevessel
Job  After him his way is shining so that the deep seems white
Job  On earth there is not another like him who is made without fear
Job  Everything which is high goes in fear of him he is king over all the sons of pride
Job  And Job said in answer to the Lord
Job  I see that you are able to do every thing and to give effect to all your designs
Job  Who is this who makes dark the purpose of God by words without knowledge For I have been talking without knowledge about wonders not to be searched out
Job  Give ear to me and I will say what is in my mind I will put questions to you and you will give me the answers
Job  Word of you had come to my ears but now my eye has seen you
Job  For this cause I give witness that what I said is false and in sorrow I take my seat in the dust
Job  And it came about after he had said these words to Job that the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite I am very angry with you and your two friends because you have not said what is right about me as my servant Job has
Job  And now take seven oxen and seven sheep and go to my servant Job and give a burned offering for yourselves and my servant Job will make prayer for you that I may not send punishment on you because you have not said what is right about me as my servant Job has
Job  And Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the Lord had said And the Lord gave ear to Job
Job  And the Lord made up to Job for all his losses after he had made prayer for his friends and all Job had before was increased by the Lord twice as much
Job  And all his brothers and sisters and his friends of earlier days came and took food with him in his house and made clear their grief for him and gave him comfort for all the evil which the Lord had sent on him and they all gave him a bit of money and a gold ring
Job  And the Lords blessing was greater on the end of Jobs life than on its start and so he came to have fourteen thousand sheep and goats and six thousand camels and two thousand oxen and a thousand sheasses
Job  And he had seven sons and three daughters
Job  And he gave the first the name of Jemimah the second Keziah and the third Kerenhappuch
Job  And there were no women so beautiful as the daughters of Job in all the earth and their father gave them a heritage among their brothers
Job  And after this Job had a hundred and forty years of life and saw his sons and his sons sons even four generations
Job  And Job came to his end old and full of days

Psm  For the evildoer is lifted up because of the purpose of his heart and he whose mind is fixed on wealth is turned away from the Lord saying evil against him
Psm  The evildoer in his pride says God will not make a search All his thoughts are There is no God
Psm  His ways are ever fixed your decisions are higher than he may see as for his haters they are as nothing to him
Psm  He has said in his heart I will not be moved through all generations I will never be in trouble
Psm  His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and false words under his tongue are evil purposes and dark thoughts
Psm  He is waiting in the dark places of the towns in the secret places he puts to death those who have done no wrong his eyes are secretly turned against the poor
Psm  He keeps himself in a secret place like a lion in his hole waiting to put his hands on the poor man and pulling him into his net
Psm  The upright are crushed and made low and the feeble are overcome by his strong ones
Psm  He says in his heart God has no memory of me his face is turned away he will never see it
Psm  Up O Lord let your hand be lifted give thought to the poor
Psm  Why has the evildoer a low opinion of God saying in his heart You will not make search for it
Psm  You have seen it for your eyes are on sorrow and grief to take it into your hand the poor man puts his faith in you you have been the helper of the child who has no father
Psm  Let the arm of the sinner and the evildoer be broken go on searching for his sin till there is no more
Psm  The Lord is King for ever and ever the nations are gone from his land
Psm  Lord you have given ear to the prayer of the poor you will make strong their hearts you will give them a hearing
Psm  To give decision for the child without a father and for the brokenhearted so that the man of the earth may no longer be feared
Psm  ltFor the chief musicmaker Of Davidgt In the Lord put I my faith how will you say to my soul Go in flight like a bird to the mountain
Psm  See the bows of the evildoers are bent they make ready their arrows on the cord so that they may send them secretly against the upright in heart
Psm  If the bases are broken down what is the upright man to do
Psm  The Lord is in his holy Temple the Lords seat is in heaven his eyes are watching and testing the children of men
Psm  The Lord puts the upright and the sinner to the test but he has hate in his soul for the lover of violent acts
Psm  On the evildoer he will send down fire and flames and a burning wind with these will their cup be full
Psm  For the Lord is upright he is a lover of righteousness the upright will see his face
Psm  ltFor the chief musicmaker on the Sheminith A Psalm Of Davidgt Send help Lord for mercy has come to an end there is no more faith among the children of men
Psm  Everyone says false words to his neighbour their tongues are smooth in their talk and their hearts are full of deceit
Psm  The smooth lips and the tongue of pride will be cut off by the Lord
Psm  They have said With our tongues will we overcome our lips are ours who is lord over us
Psm  Because of the crushing of the poor and the weeping of those in need now will I come to his help says the Lord I will give him the salvation which he is desiring
Psm  The words of the Lord are true words like silver tested by fire and burned clean seven times
Psm  You will keep them O Lord you will keep them safe from this generation for ever
Psm  The sinners are walking on every side and evil is honoured among the children of men
Psm  ltTo the chief musicmaker A Psalm Of Davidgt Will you for ever put me out of your memory O Lord will your face for ever be turned away from me
Psm  How long is my soul to be in doubt with sorrow in my heart all the day how long will he who is against me be given power over me
Psm  Let my voice come before you and give me an answer O Lord my God let your light be shining on me so that the sleep of death may not overtake me
Psm  And he who is against me may not say I have overcome him and those who are troubling me may not be glad when I am moved
Psm  But I have had faith in your mercy my heart will be glad in your salvation
Psm  I will make a song to the Lord because he has given me my reward
Psm  ltTo the chief musicmaker Of Davidgt The foolish man has said in his heart God will not do anything They are unclean they have done evil works there is not one who does good
Psm  The Lord was looking down from heaven on the children of men to see if there were any who had wisdom searching after God
Psm  They have all gone out of the way together they are unclean there is not one who does good no not one
Psm  Have all the workers of evil no knowledge they take my people for food as they would take bread they make no prayer to the Lord
Psm  Then were they in great fear for God is in the generation of the upright
Psm  You have put to shame the thoughts of the poor but the Lord is his support
Psm  May the salvation of Israel come out of Zion when the fate of his people is changed by the Lord Jacob will have joy and Israel will be glad
Psm  ltA Psalm Of Davidgt Lord who may have a restingplace in your tent a livingplace on your holy hill
Psm  He who goes on his way uprightly doing righteousness and saying what is true in his heart
Psm  Whose tongue is not false who does no evil to his friend and does not take away the good name of his neighbour
Psm  Who gives honour to those who have the fear of the Lord turning away from him who has not the Lords approval He who takes an oath against himself and makes no change
Psm  He who does not put out his money at interest or for payment give false decisions against men who have done no wrong He who does these things will never be moved
Psm  ltMichtam Of Davidgt Keep me safe O God for in you I have put my faith
Psm  O my soul you have said to the Lord You are my Lord I have no good but you
Psm  As for the saints who are in the earth they are the noble in whom is all my delight
Psm  Their sorrows will be increased who go after another god I will not take drink offerings from their hands or take their names on my lips
Psm  The Lord is my heritage and the wine of my cup you are the supporter of my right
Psm  Fair are the places marked out for me I have a noble heritage
Psm  I will give praise to the Lord who has been my guide knowledge comes to me from my thoughts in the night
Psm  I have put the Lord before me at all times because he is at my right hand I will not be moved
Psm  Because of this my heart is glad and my glory is full of joy while my flesh takes its rest in hope
Psm  For you will not let my soul be prisoned in the underworld you will not let your loved one see the place of death
Psm  You will make clear to me the way of life where you are joy is complete in your right hand there are pleasures for ever and ever
Psm  ltA Prayer Of Davidgt Let my cause come to your ears O Lord give attention to my cry give ear to my prayer which goes not out from false lips

Psm  Make clear the wonder of your mercy O saviour of those who put their faith in your right hand from those who come out against them
Psm  Keep me as the light of your eyes covering me with the shade of your wings
Psm  From the evildoers who are violent to me and from those who are round me desiring my death
Psm  They are shut up in their fat with their mouths they say words of pride
Psm  They have made a circle round our steps their eyes are fixed on us forcing us down to the earth
Psm  Like a lion desiring its food and like a young lion waiting in secret places
Psm  Up Lord come out against him make him low with your sword be my saviour from the evildoer
Psm  With your hand O Lord from men even men of the world whose heritage is in this life and whom you make full with your secret wealth they are full of children after their death their offspring take the rest of their goods
Psm  As for me I will see your face in righteousness when I am awake it will be joy enough for me to see your form
Psm  ltTo the chief musicmaker Of the servant of the Lord of David who said the words of this song to the Lord on the day when the Lord made him free from the hand of all his haters and from the hand of Saul and he saidgt I will give you my love O Lord my strength

Psm  I will send up my cry to the Lord who is to be praised so will I be made safe from those who are against me
Psm  The cords of death were round me and the seas of evil put me in fear
Psm  The cords of hell were round me the nets of death came on me
Psm  In my trouble my voice went up to the Lord and my cry to my God my voice came to his hearing in his holy Temple and my prayer came before him even into his ears
Psm  Then trouble and shock came on the earth and the bases of the mountains were moved and shaking because he was angry
Psm  There went up a smoke from his nose and a fire of destruction from his mouth flames were lighted by it
Psm  The heavens were bent so that he might come down and it was dark under his feet
Psm  And he went in flight through the air seated on a stormcloud going quickly on the wings of the wind
Psm  He made the dark his secret place his tent round him was the dark waters and thick clouds of the skies
Psm  Before his shining light his dark clouds went past raining ice and fire
Psm  The Lord made thunder in the heavens and the voice of the Highest was sounding out a rain of ice and fire
Psm  He sent out his arrows driving them in all directions by his flames of fire they were troubled
Psm  Then the deep beds of the waters were seen and the bases of the world were uncovered because of your words of wrath O Lord because of the breath from your mouth
Psm  He sent from on high he took me pulling me out of great waters
Psm  He made me free from my strong hater and from those who were against me because they were stronger than I
Psm  They came on me in the day of my trouble but the Lord was my support

Psm  But the gentle will have the earth for their heritage they will take their delight in peace without measure
Psm  The sinner has evil designs against the upright lifting up the voice of wrath against him
Psm  He will be laughed at by the Lord who sees that his day is coming
Psm  The evildoers have taken out their swords their bows are bent for crushing the poor and to put to death those who are upright in their ways
Psm  But their swords will be turned into their hearts and their bows will be broken
Psm  The little which the good man has is better than the wealth of evildoers
Psm  For the arms of the evildoers will be broken but the Lord is the support of the good
Psm  The days of the upright are numbered by the Lord and their heritage will be for ever
Psm  They will not be shamed in the evil time and in the days when all are in need of food they will have enough
Psm  But the wrongdoers will come to destruction and the haters of the Lord will be like the fat of lambs they will be burned up they will go up in smoke and never again be seen

Psm  I have seen the evildoer in great power covering the earth like a great tree
Psm  But he came to an end and there was no sign of him I made a search for him and he was not there
Psm  Give attention to the good man and take note of the upright because the end of that man is peace
Psm  But as for the sinners they will be cut off together the end of the wrongdoers is destruction
Psm  But the Lord is the saviour of the upright he is their strength in the time of trouble

Psm  My lovers and my friends keep away from my disease my relations keep far away
Psm  Those who have a desire to take my life put nets for me those who are designing my destruction say evil things against me all the day their minds are full of deceit

Psm  In you O Lord is my hope you will give me an answer O Lord my God
Psm  I said Let them not be glad over me when my foot is moved let them not be lifted up with pride against me
Psm  My feet are near to falling and my sorrow is ever before me
Psm  I will make clear my wrongdoing with sorrow in my heart for my sin

Psm  Make your way about Zion and go round it numbering its towers
Psm  Take note of its strong walls looking well at its fair buildings so that you may give word of it to the generation which comes after
Psm  Because this God is our God for ever and ever he will be our guide
Psm  ltAlamoth To the chief musicmaker Of the sons of Korah A Psalmgt Give attention to this all you peoples let your ears be open all you who are living in the world
Psm  High and low together the poor and those who have wealth
Psm  From my mouth will come words of wisdom and in the thoughts of my heart will be knowledge
Psm  I will put my teaching into a story I will make my dark sayings clear with music
Psm  What cause have I for fear in the days of evil when the evildoing of those who are working for my downfall is round about me
Psm  Even of those whose faith is in their wealth and whose hearts are lifted up because of their stores
Psm  Truly no man may get back his soul for a price or give to God the payment for himself
Psm  Because it takes a great price to keep his soul from death and man is not able to give it
Psm  So that he might have eternal life and never see the underworld
Psm  For he sees that wise men come to their end and foolish persons of low behaviour come to destruction together letting their wealth go to others
Psm  The place of the dead is their house for ever and their restingplace through all generations those who come after them give their names to their lands
Psm  But man like the animals does not go on for ever he comes to an end like the beasts
Psm  This is the way of the foolish their silver is for those who come after them and their children get the pleasure of their gold Selah
Psm  Death will give them their food like sheep the underworld is their fate and they will go down into it their flesh is food for worms their form is wasted away the underworld is their restingplace for ever
Psm  But God will get back my soul for he will take me from the power of death Selah
Psm  Have no fear when wealth comes to a man and the glory of his house is increased
Psm  For at his death he will take nothing away his glory will not go down after him
Psm  Though he might have pride in his soul in his lifetime and men will give you praise if you do well for yourself
Psm  He will go to the generation of his fathers he will not see the light again
Psm  Man like the animals does not go on for ever he comes to an end like the beasts
Psm  ltA Psalm Of Asaphgt The God of gods even the Lord has sent out his voice and the earth is full of fear from the coming up of the sun to its going down
Psm  From Zion most beautiful of places God has sent out his light
Psm  Our God will come and will not keep quiet with fire burning before him and stormwinds round him
Psm  His voice will go out to the heavens and to the earth for the judging of his people
Psm  Let my saints come together to me those who have made an agreement with me by offerings
Psm  And let the heavens make clear his righteousness for God himself is the judge Selah
Psm  Give ear O my people to my words O Israel I will be a witness against you I am God even your God
Psm  I will not take up a cause against you because of your offerings or because of your burned offerings which are ever before me
Psm  I will take no ox out of your house or hegoats from your flocks
Psm  For every beast of the woodland is mine and the cattle on a thousand hills
Psm  I see all the birds of the mountains and the beasts of the field are mine
Psm  If I had need of food I would not give you word of it for the earth is mine and all its wealth
Psm  Am I to take the flesh of the ox for my food or the blood of goats for my drink
Psm  Make an offering of praise to God keep the agreements which you have made with the Most High
Psm  Let your voice come up to me in the day of trouble I will be your saviour so that you may give glory to me
Psm  But to the sinner God says What are you doing talking of my laws or taking the words of my agreement in your mouth
Psm  Seeing that you have no desire for my teaching turning your back on my words
Psm  When you saw a thief you were in agreement with him and you were joined with those who took other mens wives
Psm  You have given your mouth to evil your tongue to words of deceit
Psm  You say evil of your brother you make false statements against your mothers son
Psm  These things have you done and I said nothing it seemed to you that I was such a one as yourself but I will make a protest against you and put them in order before your eyes
Psm  Now keep this in mind you who have no memory of God for fear that you may be crushed under my hand with no one to give you help
Psm  Whoever makes an offering of praise gives glory to me and to him who is upright in his ways I will make clear the salvation of God
Psm  ltTo the chief musicmaker A Psalm Of David When Nathan the prophet came to him after he had gone in to Bathshebagt Have pity on me O God in your mercy out of a full heart take away my sin
Psm  Let all my wrongdoing be washed away and make me clean from evil
Psm  For I am conscious of my error my sin is ever before me
Psm  Against you you only have I done wrong working that which is evil in your eyes so that your words may be seen to be right and you may be clear when you are judging
Psm  Truly I was formed in evil and in sin did my mother give me birth
Psm  Your desire is for what is true in the inner parts in the secrets of my soul you will give me knowledge of wisdom
Psm  Make me free from sin with hyssop let me be washed whiter than snow
Psm  Make me full of joy and rapture so that the bones which have been broken may be glad
Psm  Let your face be turned from my wrongdoing and take away all my sins
Psm  Make a clean heart in me O God give me a right spirit again
Psm  Do not put me away from before you or take your holy spirit from me
Psm  Give me back the joy of your salvation let a free spirit be my support
Psm  Then will I make your ways clear to wrongdoers and sinners will be turned to you
Psm  Be my saviour from violent death O God the God of my salvation and my tongue will give praise to your righteousness
Psm  O Lord let my lips be open so that my mouth may make clear your praise
Psm  You have no desire for an offering or I would give it you have no delight in burned offerings
Psm  The offerings of God are a broken spirit a broken and sorrowing heart O God you will not put from you
Psm  Do good to Zion in your good pleasure building up the walls of Jerusalem
Psm  Then you will have delight in the offerings of righteousness in burned offerings and offerings of beasts then they will make offerings of oxen on your altar
Psm  ltTo the chief musicmaker Maschil Of David When Doeg the Edomite came to Saul saying David has come to the house of Ahimelechgt Why do you take pride in wrongdoing lifting yourself up against the upright man all the day
Psm  Purposing destruction using deceit your tongue is like a sharp blade
Psm  You have more love for evil than for good for deceit than for works of righteousness Selah
Psm  Destruction is in all your words O false tongue
Psm  But God will put an end to you for ever driving you out from your tent uprooting you from the land of the living Selah
Psm  The upright will see it with fear and will say laughing at you
Psm  See this is the man who did not make God his strength but had faith in his goods and his property and made himself strong in his wealth
Psm  But I am like a branching olivetree in the house of God I have put my faith in his mercy for ever and ever
Psm  I will give you praise without end for what you have done I will give honour to your name before your saints for it is good
Psm  ltTo the chief musicmaker put to Mahalath Maschil Of Davidgt The foolish man has said in his heart God will not do anything They are unclean they have done evil works there is not one who does good
Psm  God was looking down from heaven on the children of men to see if there were any who had wisdom searching after God
Psm  Every one of them has gone back they are unclean there is not one who does good no not one
Psm  Have the workers of evil no knowledge they take my people for food as they would take bread they make no prayer to God
Psm  They were in great fear where there was no cause for fear for the bones of those who make war on you have been broken by God you have put them to shame because God has no desire for them
Psm  May the salvation of Israel come out of Zion When the fate of his people is changed by God Jacob will have joy and Israel will be glad

Psm  Let my prayer come before you O God give ear to the words of my mouth
Psm  For men who are going after me have come out against me violent men are purposing to take my soul they have not put God before their eyes Selah
Psm  See God is my helper the Lord is the great supporter of my soul
Psm  Let the evil works of my haters come back on them again let them be cut off by your good faith
Psm  Freely will I make my offerings to you I will give praise to your name O Lord for it is good
Psm  Because it has been my saviour from all my trouble and my eyes have seen the punishment of my haters
Psm  ltTo the chief musicmaker on Neginoth Maschil Of Davidgt Give hearing to my prayer O God and let not your ear be shut against my request
Psm  Give thought to me and let my prayer be answered I have been made low in sorrow
Psm  I am troubled because of the voice of the cruel ones because of the loud cry of the evildoers for they put a weight of evil on me and they are cruel in their hate for me
Psm  My heart is deeply wounded and the fear of death has come on me
Psm  Fear and shaking have come over me with deep fear I am covered
Psm  And I said If only I had wings like a dove for then I would go in flight from here and be at rest
Psm  I would go wandering far away living in the waste land Selah
Psm  I would quickly take cover from the driving storm and from the violent wind
Psm  Send destruction on them O Lord make a division of tongues among them for I have seen fighting and violent acts in the town

Psm  For it was not my hater who said evil of me that would have been no grief to me it was not one outside the number of my friends who made himself strong against me or I would have kept myself from him in a secret place
Psm  But it was you my equal my guide my wellloved friend
Psm  We had loving talk together and went to the house of God in company
Psm  Let the hand of death come on them suddenly and let them go down living into the underworld because evil is in their houses and in their hearts
Psm  As for me I will make my prayer to God and he will be my saviour
Psm  In the evening and in the morning and in the middle of the day I will make my prayer with sounds of grief and my voice will come to his ears
Psm  He has taken my soul away from the attack which was made against me and given it peace for great numbers were against me
Psm  God will give thought to me he who from early times is strong will send pain and trouble on them Selah Because they are unchanged they have no fear of God
Psm  He has put out his hand against those who were at peace with him he has not kept his agreement
Psm  The words of his mouth were smoother than butter but war was in his heart his words were softer than oil but they were sharp swords
Psm  Put your cares on the Lord and he will be your support he will not let the upright man be moved
Psm  But you O God will send them down into the underworld the cruel and the false will be cut off before half their days are ended but I will have faith in you

Psm  I have been wounded with sharp words because of you my face has been covered with shame
Psm  I have become strange to my brothers and like a man from a far country to my mothers children
Psm  I am on fire with passion for your house and the hard things which are said about you have come on me
Psm  My bitter weeping and my going without food were turned to my shame
Psm  When I put on the clothing of grief they said evil of me
Psm  I am a cause of wonder to those in authority a song to those who are given to strong drink

Psm  Take me from the grip of the sticky earth so that I may not go down into it let me be lifted up from the deep waters
Psm  Let me not be covered by the flowing waters let not the deep waters go over my head and let me not be shut up in the underworld
Psm  Give an answer to my words O Lord for your mercy is good be turned to me because of your great pity
Psm  Let not your face be covered from your servant for I am in trouble quickly give me an answer
Psm  Come near to my soul for its salvation be my saviour because of those who are against me
Psm  You have seen my shame how I was laughed at and made low my haters are all before you
Psm  My heart is broken by bitter words I am full of grief I made a search for some to have pity on me but there was no one I had no comforter
Psm  They gave me poison for my food and bitter wine for my drink
Psm  Let their table before them be for their destruction let their feasts become a net to take them
Psm  Let their eyes be blind so that they may not see let their bodies for ever be shaking
Psm  Let your curse come on them let the heat of your wrath overtake them
Psm  Give their houses to destruction and let there be no one in their tents
Psm  Because they are cruel to him against whom your hand is turned they make bitter the grief of him who is wounded by you
Psm  Let their punishment be increased let them not come into your righteousness
Psm  Let their names be taken from the book of the living let them not be numbered with the upright
Psm  But I am poor and full of sorrow let me be lifted up by your salvation O Lord
Psm  I will give praise to the name of God with a song I will give glory to him for what he has done
Psm  This will be more pleasing to the Lord than an ox or a young ox of full growth
Psm  The poor will see it and be glad you who are lovers of God let your hearts have life
Psm  For the ears of the Lord are open to the poor and he takes thought for his prisoners
Psm  Let the heavens and the earth give praise to him the seas and everything moving in them
Psm  For God will be the saviour of Zion and the builder of the towns of Judah so that it may be their restingplace and heritage
Psm  The seed of his servants will have their part in it and there the lovers of his name will have rest

Psm  I will give news of the great acts of the Lord God my words will be of your righteousness and of yours only
Psm  O God you have been my teacher from the time when I was young and I have been talking of your works of wonder even till now
Psm  Now when I am old and greyheaded O God give me not up till I have made clear your strength to this generation and your power to all those to come
Psm  Your righteousness O God is very high you have done great things O God who is like you
Psm  You who have sent great and bitter troubles on me will give me life again lifting me up from the deep waters of the underworld
Psm  You will make me greater than before and give me comfort on every side
Psm  I will give praise to you with instruments of music O my God for you are true I will make songs to you with music O Holy One of Israel

Psm  ltOf Solomongt Give the king your authority O God and your righteousness to the kings son
Psm  May he be a judge of your people in righteousness and make true decisions for the poor

Psm  He will have pity on the poor and be the saviour of those who are in need
Psm  He will keep their souls free from evil designs and violent attacks and their blood will be of value in his eyes
Psm  May he have long life and may gold from Sheba be given to him may prayers be made for him at all times may blessings be on him every day

Psm  The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended ltA Psalm Of Asaphgt
Psm  Truly God is good to Israel even to such as are clean in heart
Psm  But as for me my feet had almost gone from under me I was near to slipping
Psm  Because of my envy of the men of pride when I saw the wellbeing of the wrongdoers
Psm  For they have no pain their bodies are fat and strong
Psm  They are not in trouble as others are they have no part in the unhappy fate of men
Psm  For this reason pride is round them like a chain they are clothed with violent behaviour as with a robe
Psm  Their eyes are bursting with fat they have more than their hearts desire
Psm  Their thoughts are deep with evil designs their talk from their seats of power is of cruel acts
Psm  Their mouth goes up to heaven their tongues go walking through the earth
Psm  For this reason they are full of bread and water is ever flowing for them
Psm  And they say How will the Lord see this is there knowledge in the Most High
Psm  Truly such are the sinners they do well at all times and their wealth is increased
Psm  As for me I have made my heart clean to no purpose washing my hands in righteousness
Psm  For I have been troubled all the day every morning have I undergone punishment
Psm  If I would make clear what it is like I would say You are false to the generation of your children
Psm  When my thoughts were turned to see the reason of this it was a weariness in my eyes
Psm  Till I went into Gods holy place and saw the end of the evildoers
Psm  You put their feet where there was danger of slipping so that they go down into destruction
Psm  How suddenly are they wasted fears are the cause of their destruction
Psm  As a dream when one is awake they are ended they are like an image gone out of mind when sleep is over
Psm  My heart was made bitter and I was pained by the bite of grief
Psm  As for me I was foolish and without knowledge I was like a beast before you
Psm  But still I am ever with you you have taken me by my right hand
Psm  Your wisdom will be my guide and later you will put me in a place of honour
Psm  Whom have I in heaven but you and having you I have no desire for anything on earth
Psm  My flesh and my heart are wasting away but God is the Rock of my heart and my eternal heritage
Psm  For those who are far away from you will come to destruction you will put an end to all those who have not kept faith with you
Psm  But it is good for me to come near to God I have put my faith in the Lord God so that I may make clear all his works
Psm  ltMaschil Of Asaphgt Of God why have you put us away from you for ever why is the fire of your wrath smoking against the sheep who are your care
Psm  Keep in mind your band of worshippers for whom you gave payment in the days which are past whom you took for yourself as the people of your heritage even this mountain of Zion which has been your restingplace
Psm  Go up and see the unending destruction all the evil which your haters have done in the holy place
Psm  Sending out their voices like lions among your worshippers they have put up their signs to be seen
Psm  They are cutting down like a man whose blade is lifted up against the thick trees
Psm  Your doors are broken down with hammers and iron blades
Psm  They have put on fire your holy place they have made the place of your name unclean pulling it down to the earth
Psm  They have said in their hearts Let us put an end to them all together they have given over to the fire all Gods places of worship in the land
Psm  We do not see our signs there is no longer any prophet or anyone among us to say how long
Psm  O God how long will those who are against us say cruel things will the hater go on looking down on your name for ever
Psm  Why are you keeping back your hand and covering your right hand in your robe
Psm  For from the past God is my King working salvation in the earth
Psm  The sea was parted in two by your strength the heads of the great seabeasts were broken
Psm  The heads of the great snake were crushed by you you gave them as food to the fishes of the sea
Psm  You made valleys for fountains and springs you made the everflowing rivers dry
Psm  The day is yours and the night is yours you made the light and the sun
Psm  By you all the limits of the earth were fixed you have made summer and winter
Psm  Keep this in mind O Lord that your haters have said cruel things and that your name has been looked down on by a people of evil behaviour
Psm  O give not the soul of your dove to the hawk let not the life of the poor go out of your memory for ever
Psm  Keep in mind your undertaking for the dark places of the earth are full of pride and cruel acts
Psm  O let not the crushed be turned back in shame let the low man and the poor give praise to your name
Psm  Up O God be the judge of your cause keep in mind the bitter things which the man of evil behaviour says against you every day
Psm  Keep in mind the voice of your haters the outcry of those who come against you goes up every day
Psm  ltTo the chief musicmaker put to Altashheth A Psalm Of Asaph A Songgt To you O God we give praise to you we give praise and those who give honour to your name make clear your works of power
Psm  When the right time has come I will be the judge in righteousness
Psm  When the earth and all its people become feeble I am the support of its pillars Selah
Psm  I say to the men of pride Let your pride be gone and to the sinners Let not your horn be lifted up
Psm  Let not your horn be lifted up let no more words of pride come from your outstretched necks
Psm  For honour does not come from the east or from the west or uplifting from the south
Psm  But God is the judge putting down one and lifting up another
Psm  For in the hand of the Lord is a cup and the wine is red it is well mixed overflowing from his hand he will make all the sinners of the earth take of it even to the last drop
Psm  But I will ever be full of joy making songs of praise to the God of Jacob
Psm  By him will all the horns of the sinners be cut off but the horns of the upright will be lifted up
Psm  ltTo the chief musicmaker put to Neginoth A Psalm Of Asaph A Songgt In Judah is the knowledge of God his name is great in Israel
Psm  In Salem is his tent his restingplace in Zion
Psm  There were the arrows of the bow broken there he put an end to bodycover sword and fight Selah
Psm  You are shining and full of glory more than the eternal mountains
Psm  Gone is the wealth of the strong their last sleep has overcome them the men of war have become feeble
Psm  At the voice of your wrath O God of Jacob deep sleep has overcome carriage and horse
Psm  You you are to be feared who may keep his place before you in the time of your wrath
Psm  From heaven you gave your decision the earth in its fear gave no sound
Psm  When God took his place as judge for the salvation of the poor on the earth Selah
Psm  The  will give you praise the rest of 
Psm  Give to the Lord your God what is his by right let all who are round him give offerings to him who is to be feared
Psm  He puts an end to the wrath of rulers he is feared by the kings of the earth
Psm  ltTo the chief musicmaker After Jeduthun Of Asaph A Psalmgt I was crying to God with my voice even to God with my voice and he gave ear to me
Psm  In the day of my trouble my heart was turned to the Lord my hand was stretched out in the night without resting my soul would not be comforted
Psm  I will keep God in memory with sounds of grief my thoughts are troubled and my spirit is overcome Selah
Psm  You keep my eyes from sleep I am so troubled that no words come
Psm  My thoughts go back to the days of the past to the years which are gone
Psm  The memory of my song comes back to me in the night my thoughts are moving in my heart my spirit is searching with care
Psm  Will the Lord put me away for ever will he be kind no longer
Psm  Is his mercy quite gone for ever has his word come to nothing
Psm  Has God put away the memory of his pity are his mercies shut up by his wrath Selah
Psm  And I said It is a weight on my spirit but I will keep in mind the years of the right hand of the Most High
Psm  I will keep in mind the works of Jah I will keep the memory of your wonders in the past
Psm  I will give thought to all your work while my mind goes over your acts of power
Psm  Your way O God is holy what god is so great as our God
Psm  You are the God who does works of power you have made your strength clear to the nations
Psm  With your arm you have made your people free the sons of Jacob and Joseph Selah
Psm  The waters saw you O God the waters saw you they were in fear even the deep was troubled
Psm  The clouds sent out water the skies gave out a sound truly your arrows went far and wide
Psm  The voice of your thunder went rolling on the world was flaming with the light of the storm the earth was shaking
Psm  Your way was in the sea and your road in the great waters there was no knowledge of your footsteps
Psm  You were guiding your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron
Psm  ltMaschil Of Asaphgt Give ear O my people to my law let your ears be bent down to the words of my mouth
Psm  Opening my mouth I will give out a story even the dark sayings of old times
Psm  Which have come to our hearing and our knowledge as they were given to us by our fathers
Psm  We will not keep them secret from our children we will make clear to the coming generation the praises of the Lord and his strength and the great works of wonder which he has done
Psm  He put up a witness in Jacob and made a law in Israel which he gave to our fathers so that they might give knowledge of them to their children
Psm  So that the generation to come might have knowledge of them even the children of the future who would give word of them to their children
Psm  So that they might put their hope in God and not let Gods works go out of their minds but keep his laws
Psm  And not be like their fathers a stiffnecked and uncontrolled generation a generation whose heart was hard whose spirit was not true to God
Psm  The children of Ephraim armed with bows were turned back on the day of the fight
Psm  They were not ruled by Gods word and they would not go in the way of his law
Psm  They let his works go out of their memory and the wonders which he had made them see
Psm  He did great works before the eyes of their fathers in the land of Egypt in the fields of Zoan
Psm  The sea was cut in two so that they might go through the waters were massed together on this side and on that
Psm  In the daytime he was guiding them in the cloud and all through the night with a light of fire
Psm  The rocks of the waste land were broken by his power and he gave them drink as out of the deep waters
Psm  He made streams come out of the rock and waters came flowing down like rivers
Psm  And they went on sinning against him even more turning away from the Most High in the waste land
Psm  Testing God in their hearts requesting meat for their desire
Psm  They said bitter words against God saying Is God able to make ready a table in the waste land
Psm  See the rock was cut open by his power so that the water came rushing out and overflowing streams is he able to give us bread is he able to get meat for his people
Psm  So these things came to the Lords ears and he was angry and a fire was lighted against Jacob and wrath came up against Israel
Psm  Because they had no faith in God and no hope in his salvation
Psm  And he gave orders to the clouds on high and the doors of heaven were open
Psm  And he sent down manna like rain for their food and gave them the grain of heaven
Psm  Man took part in the food of strong ones he sent them meat in full measure
Psm  He sent an east wind from heaven driving on the south wind by his power
Psm  He sent down meat on them like dust and feathered birds like the sand of the sea
Psm  And he let it come down into their restingplace round about their tents
Psm  So they had food and were full for he gave them their desire
Psm  But they were not turned from their desires and while the food was still in their mouths
Psm  The wrath of God came on them and put to death the fattest of them and put an end to the young men of Israel
Psm  For all this they went on sinning even more and had no faith in his great wonders
Psm  So their days were wasted like a breath and their years in trouble
Psm  When he sent death on them then they made search for him turning to him and looking for him with care
Psm  In the memory that God was their Rock and the Most High God their saviour
Psm  But their lips were false to him and their tongues were untrue to him
Psm  And their hearts were not right with him and they did not keep their agreement with him
Psm  But he being full of pity has forgiveness for sin and does not put an end to man frequently turning back his wrath and not being violently angry
Psm  So he kept in mind that they were only flesh a breath which is quickly gone and will not come again
Psm  How frequently did they go against him in the waste land and give him cause for grief in the dry places
Psm  Again they put God to the test and gave pain to the Holy One of Israel
Psm  They did not keep in mind the work of his hand or the day when he took them from the power of their haters
Psm  How he had done his signs in Egypt and his wonders in the field of Zoan
Psm  So that their rivers were turned to blood and they were not able to get drink from their streams
Psm  He sent different sorts of flies among them poisoning their flesh and frogs for their destruction
Psm  He gave the increase of their fields to worms the fruits of their industry to the locusts
Psm  He sent ice for the destruction of their vines their trees were damaged by the bitter cold
Psm  Ice was rained down on their cattle thunderstorms sent destruction among the flocks
Psm  He sent on them the heat of his wrath his bitter disgust letting loose evil angels among them
Psm  He let his wrath have its way he did not keep back their soul from death but gave their life to disease
Psm  He gave to destruction all the first sons of Egypt the firstfruits of their strength in the tents of Ham
Psm  But he took his people out like sheep guiding them in the waste land like a flock
Psm  He took them on safely so that they had no fear but their haters were covered by the sea
Psm  And he was their guide to his holy land even to the mountain which his right hand had made his
Psm  Driving out nations before them marking out the line of their heritage and giving the people of Israel their tents for a restingplace
Psm  But they were bitter against the Most High God testing him and not keeping his laws
Psm  Their hearts were turned back and untrue like their fathers they were turned to one side like a twisted bow
Psm  They made him angry with their high places moving him to wrath with their images
Psm  When this came to Gods ears he was very angry and gave up Israel completely
Psm  So that he went away from the holy place in Shiloh the tent which he had put among men
Psm  And he let his strength be taken prisoner and gave his glory into the hands of his hater
Psm  He gave his people up to the sword and was angry with his heritage
Psm  Their young men were burned in the fire and their virgins were not praised in the bridesong
Psm  Their priests were put to death by the sword and their widows made no weeping for them
Psm  Then was the Lord like one awaking from sleep and like a strong man crying out because of wine
Psm  His haters were turned back by his blows and shamed for ever
Psm  And he put the tent of Joseph on one side and took not the tribe of Ephraim
Psm  But he took the tribe of Judah for himself and the mountain of Zion in which he had pleasure
Psm  And he made his holy place like the high heaven like the earth which is fixed by him for ever
Psm  He took David to be his servant taking him from the place of the flocks
Psm  From looking after the sheep which were giving milk he took him to give food to Jacob his people and to Israel his heritage
Psm  So he gave them food with an upright heart guiding them by the wisdom of his hands
Psm  ltA Psalm Of Asaphgt O God the nations have come into your heritage they have made your holy Temple unclean they have made Jerusalem a mass of broken walls
Psm  They have given the bodies of your servants as food to the birds of the air and the flesh of your saints to the beasts of the earth
Psm  Their blood has been flowing like water round about Jerusalem there was no one to put them in their last restingplace
Psm  We are looked down on by our neighbours we are laughed at and made sport of by those who are round us
Psm  How long O Lord will you be angry for ever will your wrath go on burning like fire
Psm  Let your wrath be on the nations who have no knowledge of you and on the kingdoms who have not made prayer to your name
Psm  For they have taken Jacob for their meat and made waste his house
Psm  Do not keep in mind against us the sins of our fathers let your mercy come to us quickly for we have been made very low
Psm  Give us help O God of our salvation for the glory of your name take us out of danger and give us forgiveness for our sins because of your name
Psm  Why may the nations say Where is their God Let payment for the blood of your servants be made openly among the nations before our eyes
Psm  Let the cry of the prisoner come before you with your strong arm make free the children of death
Psm  And give punishment seven times over into the breast of our neighbours for the bitter words which they have said against you O Lord
Psm  So we your people and the sheep of your flock will give you glory for ever we will go on praising you through all generations
Psm  ltTo the chief musicmaker put to Shoshannimeduth Of Asaph A Psalmgt Give ear O Keeper of Israel guiding Joseph like a flock you who have your seat on the winged ones let your glory be seen
Psm  Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh let your strength be awake from sleep and come as our salvation
Psm  Take us back again O God let us see the shining of your face and let us be safe
Psm  O Lord God of armies how long will your wrath be burning against the rest of your people
Psm  You have given them the bread of weeping for food for their drink you have given them sorrow in great measure
Psm  You make us a cause of war among our neighbours our haters are laughing at us among themselves
Psm  Take us back again O God of armies let us see the shining of your face and let us be safe
Psm  You took a vine out of Egypt driving out the nations and planting it in their land
Psm  You made ready a place for it so that it might take deep root and it sent out its branches over all the land
Psm  The mountains were covered with its shade and the great trees with its branches
Psm  It sent out its arms to the Sea and its branches to the River
Psm  Why are its walls broken down by your hands so that all who go by may take its fruit
Psm  It is uprooted by the pigs from the woods the beasts of the field get their food from it
Psm  Come back O God of armies from heaven let your eyes be turned to this vine and give your mind to it
Psm  Even to the tree which was planted by your right hand and to the branch which you made strong for yourself
Psm  It is burned with fire it is cut down they are made waste by the wrath of your face
Psm  Let your hand be on the man of your right hand on the son of man whom you made strong for yourself
Psm  So will we not be turned back from you keep us in life and we will give praise to your name
Psm  Take us back O Lord God of armies let us see the shining of your face and let us be safe
Psm  ltTo the chief musicmaker put to the Gittith Of Asaphgt Make a song to God our strength make a glad cry to the God of Jacob
Psm  Take up the melody playing on an instrument of music even on corded instruments
Psm  Let the horn be sounded in the time of the new moon at the full moon on our holy feastday
Psm  For this is a rule for Israel and a law of the God of Jacob
Psm  He gave it to Joseph as a witness when he went out over the land of Egypt then the words of a strange tongue were sounding in my ears
Psm  I took the weight from his back his hands were made free from the baskets
Psm  You gave a cry in your trouble and I made you free I gave you an answer in the secret place of the thunder I put you to the test at the waters of Meribah Selah
Psm  Give ear O my people and I will give you my word O Israel if you will only do as I say
Psm  There is to be no strange god among you you are not to give worship to any other god
Psm  I am the Lord your God who took you up from the land of Egypt let your mouth be open wide so that I may give you food
Psm  But my people did not give ear to my voice Israel would have nothing to do with me
Psm  So I gave them up to the desires of their hearts that they might go after their evil purposes
Psm  If only my people would give ear to me walking in my ways
Psm  I would quickly overcome their haters my hand would be turned against those who make war on them
Psm  The haters of the Lord would be broken and their destruction would be eternal
Psm  I would give them the best grain for food you would be full of honey from the rock
Psm  ltA Psalm Of Asaphgt God is in the meetingplace of God he is judging among the gods
Psm  How long will you go on judging falsely having respect for the persons of evildoers Selah
Psm  Give ear to the cause of the poor and the children without fathers let those who are troubled and in need have their rights
Psm  Be the saviour of the poor and those who have nothing take them out of the hand of the evildoers
Psm  They have no knowledge or sense they go about in the dark all the bases of the earth are moved
Psm  I said You are gods all of you are the sons of the Most High

Psm  ltA Song A Psalm Of Asaphgt O God do not keep quiet let your lips be open and take no rest O God
Psm  For see those who make war on you are out of control your haters are lifting up their heads
Psm  They have made wise designs against your people talking together against those whom you keep in a secret place
Psm  They have said Come let us put an end to them as a nation so that the name of Israel may go out of mans memory
Psm  For they have all come to an agreement they are all joined together against you
Psm  The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites Moab and the Hagarites
Psm  Gebal and Ammon and Amalek the Philistines and the people of Tyre
Psm  Assur is joined with them they have become the support of the children of Lot Selah
Psm  Do to them what you did to the Midianites what you did to Sisera and Jabin at the stream of Kishon
Psm  Who came to destruction at Endor their bodies became dust and waste
Psm  Make their chiefs like Oreb and Zeeb and all their rulers like Zebah and Zalmunna
Psm  Who have said Let us take for our heritage the restingplace of God

Psm  As fire burning a wood and as a flame causing fire on the mountains
Psm  So go after them with your strong wind and let them be full of fear because of your storm
Psm  Let their faces be full of shame so that they may give honour to your name O Lord

Psm  Happy is the man who is guided by you O Jah and to whom you give teaching out of your law
Psm  So that you may give him rest from the days of evil till a hole is made ready for the destruction of the sinners
Psm  The Lord will not give up his people or take away his support from his heritage
Psm  But decisions will again be made in righteousness and they will be kept by all whose hearts are true

Psm  His feeling will no longer be bitter he will not keep his wrath for ever

Psm  As a father has pity on his children so the Lord has pity on his worshippers
Psm  For he has knowledge of our feeble frame he sees that we are only dust
Psm  As for man his days are as grass his beautiful growth is like the flower of the field
Psm  The wind goes over it and it is gone and its place sees it no longer
Psm  But the mercy of the Lord is eternal for his worshippers and their childrens children will see his righteousness

Psm  He makes winds his angels and flames of fire his servants
Psm  He has made the earth strong on its bases so that it may not be moved for ever and ever
Psm  Covering it with the sea as with a robe the waters were high over the mountains
Psm  At the voice of your word they went in flight at the sound of your thunder they went away in fear
Psm  The mountains came up and the valleys went down into the place which you had made ready for them
Psm  You made a limit over which they might not go so that the earth would never again be covered by them
Psm  You sent the springs into the valleys they are flowing between the hills
Psm  They give drink to every beast of the field the mountain asses come to them for water
Psm  The birds of the air have their restingplaces by them and make their song among the branches
Psm  He sends down rain from his storehouses on the hills the earth is full of the fruit of his works
Psm  He makes the grass come up for the cattle and plants for the use of man so that bread may come out of the earth
Psm  And wine to make glad the heart of man and oil to make his face shining and bread giving strength to his heart
Psm  The trees of the Lord are full of growth the cedars of Lebanon of his planting
Psm  Where the birds have their restingplaces as for the stork the tall trees are her house
Psm  The high hills are a safe place for the mountain goats and the rocks for the small beasts
Psm  He made the moon for a sign of the divisions of the year teaching the sun the time of its going down
Psm  When you make it dark it is night when all the beasts of the woods come quietly out of their secret places
Psm  The young lions go thundering after their food searching for their meat from God
Psm  The sun comes up and they come together and go back to their secret places to take their rest
Psm  Man goes out to his work and to his business till the evening
Psm  O Lord how great is the number of your works in wisdom you have made them all the earth is full of the things you have made
Psm  There is the great wide sea where there are living things great and small more than may be numbered
Psm  There go the ships there is that great beast which you have made as a plaything
Psm  All of them are waiting for you to give them their food in its time
Psm  They take what you give them they are full of the good things which come from your open hand
Psm  If your face is veiled they are troubled when you take away their breath they come to an end and go back to the dust
Psm  If you send out your spirit they are given life you make new the face of the earth
Psm  Let the glory of the Lord be for ever let the Lord have joy in his works
Psm  At whose look the earth is shaking at whose touch the mountains send out smoke
Psm  I will make songs to the Lord all my life I will make melody to my God while I have my being
Psm  Let my thoughts be sweet to him I will be glad in the Lord
Psm  Let sinners be cut off from the earth and let all evildoers come to an end Give praise to the Lord O my soul Give praise to the Lord
Psm  O give praise to the Lord give honour to his name talking of his doings among the peoples
Psm  Let your voice be sounding in songs and melody let all your thoughts be of the wonder of his works
Psm  Have glory in his holy name let the hearts of those who are searching after the Lord be glad
Psm  Let your search be for the Lord and for his strength let your hearts ever be turned to him
Psm  Keep in mind the great works which he has done his wonders and the decisions of his mouth
Psm  O you seed of Abraham his servant you children of Jacob his loved ones
Psm  He is the Lord our God he is judge of all the earth
Psm  He has kept his agreement in mind for ever the word which he gave for a thousand generations
Psm  The agreement which he made with Abraham and his oath to Isaac
Psm  And he gave it to Jacob for a law and to Israel for an eternal agreement
Psm  Saying To you will I give the land of Canaan the measured line of your heritage
Psm  When they were still small in number and strange in the land
Psm  When they went about from one nation to another and from one kingdom to another people
Psm  He would not let anyone do them wrong he even kept back kings because of them
Psm  Saying Put not your hand on those who have been marked with my holy oil and do my prophets no wrong
Psm  And he took away all food from the land so that the people were without bread
Psm  He sent a man before them even Joseph who was given as a servant for a price
Psm  His feet were fixed in chains his neck was put in iron bands
Psm  Till the time when his word came true he was tested by the word of the Lord
Psm  The king sent men to take off his chains even the ruler of the people who let him go free
Psm  He made him lord of his house and ruler over everything he had
Psm  To give his chiefs teaching at his pleasure and so that his lawgivers might get wisdom from him
Psm  Then Israel came into Egypt and Jacob was living in the land of Ham
Psm  And his people were greatly increased and became stronger than those who were against them
Psm  Their hearts were turned to hate against his people so that they made secret designs against them
Psm  He sent Moses his servant and Aaron the man of his selection
Psm  He let his signs be seen among the people and his wonders in the land of Ham
Psm  He sent black night and made it dark and they did not go against his word
Psm  At his word their waters were turned to blood and he sent death on all their fish
Psm  Their land was full of frogs even in the rooms of the king
Psm  He gave the word and there came the dogfly and insects over all the land
Psm  He gave them ice for rain and flaming fire in their land
Psm  He gave their vines and their figtrees to destruction and the trees of their land were broken down
Psm  At his word the locusts came and young locusts more than might be numbered
Psm  And put an end to all the plants of their land taking all the fruit of the earth for food
Psm  He put to death the first child of every family in the land the firstfruits of their strength
Psm  He took his people out with silver and gold there was not one feeble person among them
Psm  Egypt was glad when they went for the fear of them had come down on them
Psm  A cloud was stretched over them for a cover and he sent fire to give light in the night
Psm  At the peoples request he sent birds and gave them the bread of heaven for food
Psm  His hand made the rock open and the waters came streaming out they went down through the dry places like a river
Psm  For he kept in mind his holy word and Abraham his servant
Psm  And he took his people out with joy the men of his selection with glad cries
Psm  And gave them the lands of the nations and they took the work of the peoples for a heritage
Psm  So that they might keep his orders and be true to his laws Give praise to the Lord
Psm  Let the Lord be praised O give praise to the Lord for he is good for his mercy is unchanging for ever
Psm  Who is able to give an account of the great acts of the Lord or to make clear all his praise
Psm  Happy are they whose decisions are upright and he who does righteousness at all times
Psm  Keep me in mind O Lord when you are good to your people O let your salvation come to me
Psm  So that I may see the wellbeing of the people of your selection and have a part in the joy of your nation and take pride in your heritage
Psm  We are sinners like our fathers we have done wrong our acts are evil
Psm  Our fathers did not give thought to your wonders in Egypt they did not keep in memory the great number of your mercies but gave you cause for wrath at the sea even at the Red Sea
Psm  But he was their saviour because of his name so that men might see his great power
Psm  By his word the Red Sea was made dry and he took them through the deep waters as through the waste land
Psm  And he took them safely out of the hands of their haters and kept them from the attacks of those who were against them
Psm  And the waters went over their haters all of them came to an end
Psm  Then they had faith in his words they gave him songs of praise
Psm  But their memory of his works was short not waiting to be guided by him
Psm  They gave way to their evil desires in the waste land and put God to the test in the dry places
Psm  And he gave them their request but sent a wasting disease into their souls
Psm  They were full of envy against Moses among the tents and against Aaron the holy one of the Lord
Psm  The earth opening put an end to Dathan covering up Abiram and his band
Psm  And a fire was lighted among their tents the sinners were burned up by the flames
Psm  They made a young ox in Horeb and gave worship to an image of gold
Psm  And their glory was changed into the image of an ox whose food is grass
Psm  They had no memory of God their saviour who had done great things in Egypt
Psm  Works of wonder in the land of Ham and things of fear by the Red Sea
Psm  And he was purposing to put an end to them if Moses his special servant had not gone up before him between him and his people turning back his wrath to keep them from destruction
Psm  They were disgusted with the good land they had no belief in his word
Psm  Talking against him secretly in their tents they did not give ear to the voice of the Lord
Psm  So he made an oath against them to put an end to them in the waste land
Psm  That their children might be mixed among the nations and sent away into other lands
Psm  And they were joined to Baalpeor and took part in the offerings to the dead
Psm  So they made him angry by their behaviour and he sent disease on them
Psm  Then Phinehas got up and made prayer for them and the disease went no farther
Psm  And all the generations coming after him kept the memory of his righteousness for ever
Psm  They made God angry again at the waters of Meribah so that Moses was troubled because of them
Psm  For they made his spirit bitter and he said unwise things
Psm  They did not put an end to the peoples as the Lord had said
Psm  But they were joined to the nations learning their works
Psm  And they gave worship to images which were a danger to them
Psm  They even made offerings of their sons and their daughters to evil spirits
Psm  And gave the blood of their sons and their daughters who had done no wrong offering them to the images of Canaan and the land was made unclean with blood
Psm  So they became unclean through their works going after their evil desires
Psm  Then the wrath of the Lord was burning against his people and he was angry with his heritage
Psm  And he gave them into the hands of the nations and they were ruled by their haters
Psm  By them they were crushed and made low under their hands
Psm  Again and again he made them free but their hearts were turned against his purpose and they were overcome by their sins
Psm  But when their cry came to his ears he had pity on their trouble
Psm  And kept in mind his agreement with them and in his great mercy gave them forgiveness
Psm  He put pity into the hearts of those who made them prisoners
Psm  Be our saviour O Lord our God and let us come back together from among the nations so that we may give honour to your holy name and have glory in your praise
Psm  Praise be to the Lord God of Israel for ever and for ever and let all the people say So be it Give praise to the Lord
Psm  O give praise to the Lord for he is good for his mercy is unchanging for ever
Psm  Let those whose cause the Lord has taken up say so his people whom he has taken out of the hands of their haters
Psm  Making them come together out of all the lands from the east and from the west from the north and from the south
Psm  They were wandering in the waste places they saw no way to a restingplace
Psm  Their souls became feeble for need of food and drink
Psm  Then they sent up their cry to the Lord in their sorrow and he gave them salvation out of all their troubles
Psm  Guiding them in the right way so that they might come into the town of their restingplace
Psm  Let men give praise to the Lord for his mercy and for the wonders which he does for the children of men
Psm  He gives its desire to the unresting soul so that it is full of good things
Psm  Those who were in the dark in the black night in chains of sorrow and iron
Psm  Because they went against the words of God and gave no thought to the laws of the Most High
Psm  So that he made their hearts weighted down with grief they were falling and had no helper
Psm  Then they sent up their cry to the Lord in their sorrow and he gave them salvation out of all their troubles
Psm  He took them out of the dark and the black night and all their chains were broken
Psm  Let men give praise to the Lord for his mercy and for the wonders which he does for the children of men
Psm  The doors of brass are broken by his arm and the bands of iron are cut in two
Psm  Foolish men because of their sins and because of their wrongdoing are troubled
Psm  They are disgusted by all food and they come near to the doors of death
Psm  Then they send up their cry to the Lord in their sorrow and he gives them salvation out of all their troubles
Psm  He sent his word and made them well and kept them safe from the underworld
Psm  Let men give praise to the Lord for his mercy and for the wonders which he does for the children of men
Psm  Let them make offerings of praise giving news of his works with cries of joy
Psm  Those who go down to the sea in ships who do business in the great waters
Psm  They see the works of the Lord and his wonders in the deep
Psm  For at his word comes up the stormwind lifting high the waves
Psm  The sailors go up to heaven and down into the deep their souls are wasted because of their trouble
Psm  They are turned here and there rolling like a man who is full of wine and all their wisdom comes to nothing
Psm  Then they send up their cry to the Lord in their sorrow and he gives them salvation out of all their troubles
Psm  He makes the storm into a calm so that the waves are at peace
Psm  Then they are glad because the sea is quiet and he takes them to the harbour of their desire
Psm  Let men give praise to the Lord for his mercy and for the wonders which he does for the children of men
Psm  Let them give glory to him in the meeting of the people and praise among the chiefs
Psm  He makes rivers into waste places and springs of water into a dry land
Psm  He makes a fertile country into a salt waste because of the sins of those who are living there
Psm  He makes a waste land into a place of water and a dry land into watersprings
Psm  And there he gives the poor a restingplace so that they may make themselves a town
Psm  And put seed in the fields and make vinegardens to give them fruit
Psm  He gives them his blessing so that they are increased greatly and their cattle do not become less
Psm  And when they are made low and crushed by trouble and sorrow
Psm  He puts an end to the pride of kings and sends them wandering in the waste lands where there is no way
Psm  But he puts the poor man on high from his troubles and gives him families like a flock
Psm  The upright see it and are glad the mouth of the sinner is stopped
Psm  Let the wise give thought to these things and see the mercies of the Lord
Psm  ltA Song A Psalm Of Davidgt O God my heart is fixed I will make songs and melody even with my glory

Psm  For my love they give me back hate but I have given myself to prayer

Psm  Let the Lord keep in mind the wrongdoing of his fathers and may the sin of his mother have no forgiveness
Psm  Let them be ever before the eyes of the Lord so that the memory of them may be cut off from the earth
Psm  Because he had no mercy but was cruel to the low and the poor designing the death of the brokenhearted
Psm  As he took pleasure in cursing so let it come on him and as he had no delight in blessing let it be far from him
Psm  He put on cursing like a robe and it has come into his body like water and into his bones like oil
Psm  Let it be to him as a robe which he puts on let it be like a band which is round him at all times
Psm  Let this be the reward given to my haters from the Lord and to those who say evil of my soul
Psm  But O Lord God give me your help because of your name take me out of danger because your mercy is good
Psm  For I am poor and in need and my heart is wounded in me

Psm  For there is not a word on my tongue which is not clear to you O Lord
Psm  I am shut in by you on every side and you have put your hand on me
Psm  Such knowledge is a wonder greater than my powers it is so high that I may not come near it
Psm  Where may I go from your spirit how may I go in flight from you
Psm  If I go up to heaven you are there or if I make my bed in the underworld you are there
Psm  If I take the wings of the morning and go to the farthest parts of the sea

Psm  See if there is any way of sorrow in me and be my guide in the eternal way
Psm  ltTo the chief musicmaker A Psalm Of Davidgt O Lord take me out of the power of the evil man keep me safe from the violent man
Psm  For their hearts are full of evil designs and they are ever making ready causes of war
Psm  Their tongues are sharp like the tongue of a snake the poison of snakes is under their lips Selah
Psm  O Lord take me out of the hands of sinners keep me safe from the violent man for they are designing my downfall
Psm  The men of pride have put secret cords for my feet stretching nets in my way so that they may take me with their tricks Selah
Psm  I have said to the Lord You are my God give ear O Lord to the voice of my prayer
Psm  O Lord God the strength of my salvation you have been a cover over my head in the day of the fight
Psm  O Lord give not the wrongdoer his desire give him no help in his evil designs or he may be uplifted in pride Selah
Psm  As for those who come round me let their heads be covered by the evil of their lips
Psm  Let burning flames come down on them let them be put into the fire and into deep waters so that they may not get up again
Psm  Let not a man of evil tongue be safe on earth let destruction overtake the violent man with blow on blow
Psm  I am certain that the Lord will take care of the cause of the poor and of the rights of those who are troubled
Psm  Truly the upright will give praise to your name the holy will have a place in your house
Psm  ltA Psalm Of Davidgt Lord I have made my cry to you come to me quickly give ear to my voice when it goes up to you
Psm  Let my prayer be ordered before you like a sweet smell and let the lifting up of my hands be like the evening offering
Psm  O Lord keep a watch over my mouth keep the door of my lips
Psm  Keep my heart from desiring any evil thing or from taking part in the sins of the evildoers with men who do wrong and let me have no part in their good things
Psm  Let the upright give me punishment and let the godfearing man put me in the right way but I will not let the oil of sinners come on my head when they do evil I will give myself to prayer
Psm  When destruction comes to their judges by the side of the rock they will give ear to my words for they are sweet
Psm  Our bones are broken up at the mouth of the underworld as the earth is broken by the plough
Psm  But my eyes are turned to you O Lord God my hope is in you let not my soul be given up to death
Psm  Keep me from the net which they have put down for me and from the designs of the workers of evil
Psm  Let the sinners be taken in the nets which they themselves have put down while I go free
Psm  ltMaschil Of David A prayer when he was in the hole of the rockgt The sound of my cry went up to the Lord with my voice I made my prayer for grace to the Lord
Psm  I put all my sorrows before him and made clear to him all my trouble
Psm  When my spirit is overcome your eyes are on my goings nets have been secretly placed in the way in which I go
Psm  Looking to my right side I saw no man who was my friend I had no safe place no one had any care for my soul
Psm  I have made my cry to you O Lord I have said You are my safe place and my heritage in the land of the living
Psm  Give ear to my cry for I am made very low take me out of the hands of my haters for they are stronger than I
Psm  Take my soul out of prison so that I may give praise to your name the upright will give praise because of me for you have given me a full reward
Psm  ltA Psalm Of Davidgt Let my prayer come to you O Lord give ear to my requests for your grace keep faith with me and give me an answer in your righteousness
Psm  Let not your servant come before you to be judged for no man living is upright in your eyes
Psm  The evil man has gone after my soul my life is crushed down to the earth he has put me in the dark like those who have long been dead
Psm  Because of this my spirit is overcome and my heart is full of fear
Psm  I keep in mind the early days of the past giving thought to all your acts even to the work of your hands

Pro  Give ear my sons to the teaching of a father give attention so that you may have knowledge
Pro  For I give you good teaching do not give up the knowledge you are getting from me
Pro  For I was a son to my father a gentle and an only one to my mother
Pro  And he gave me teaching saying to me Keep my words in your heart keep my rules so that you may have life

Pro  Let there be no turning to the right or to the left keep your feet from evil
Pro  My son give attention to my wisdom let your ear be turned to my teaching
Pro  So that you may be ruled by a wise purpose and your lips may keep knowledge
Pro  For honey is dropping from the lips of the strange woman and her mouth is smoother than oil
Pro  But her end is bitter as wormwood and sharp as a twoedged sword
Pro  Her feet go down to death and her steps to the underworld
Pro  She never keeps her mind on the road of life her ways are uncertain she has no knowledge
Pro  Give ear to me then my sons and do not put away my words from you
Pro  Go far away from her do not come near the door of her house
Pro  For fear that you may give your honour to others and your wealth to strange men
Pro  And strange men may be full of your wealth and the fruit of your work go to the house of others
Pro  And you will be full of grief at the end of your life when your flesh and your body are wasted
Pro  And you will say How was teaching hated by me and my heart put no value on training
Pro  I did not give attention to the voice of my teachers my ear was not turned to those who were guiding me
Pro  I was in almost all evil in the company of the people
Pro  Let water from your store and not that of others be your drink and running water from your fountain
Pro  Let not your springs be flowing in the streets or your streams of water in the open places
Pro  Let them be for yourself only not for other men with you
Pro  Let blessing be on your fountain have joy in the wife of your early years
Pro  As a loving hind and a gentle doe let her breasts ever give you rapture let your passion at all times be moved by her love
Pro  Why let yourself my son go out of the way with a strange woman and take another woman in your arms
Pro  For a mans ways are before the eyes of the Lord and he puts all his goings in the scales
Pro  The evildoer will be taken in the net of his crimes and prisoned in the cords of his sin
Pro  He will come to his end for need of teaching he is so foolish that he will go wandering from the right way
Pro  My son if you have made yourself responsible for your neighbour or given your word for another
Pro  You are taken as in a net by the words of your mouth the sayings of your lips have overcome you
Pro  Do this my son and make yourself free because you have come into the power of your neighbour go without waiting and make a strong request to your neighbour
Pro  Give no sleep to your eyes or rest to them
Pro  Make yourself free like the roe from the hand of the archer and the bird from him who puts a net for her
Pro  Go to the ant you hater of work give thought to her ways and be wise
Pro  Having no chief overseer or ruler
Pro  She gets her meat in the summer storing up food at the time of the graincutting
Pro  How long will you be sleeping O hater of work when will you get up from your sleep
Pro  A little sleep a little rest a little folding of the hands in sleep
Pro  Then loss will come on you like an outlaw and your need like an armed man
Pro  A goodfornothing man is an evildoer he goes on his way causing trouble with false words
Pro  Making signs with his eyes rubbing with his feet and giving news with his fingers
Pro  His mind is ever designing evil he lets loose violent acts
Pro  For this cause his downfall will be sudden quickly he will be broken and there will be no help for him
Pro  Six things are hated by the Lord seven things are disgusting to him
Pro  Eyes of pride a false tongue hands which take life without cause
Pro  A heart full of evil designs feet which are quick in running after sin
Pro  A false witness breathing out untrue words and one who lets loose violent acts among brothers
Pro  My son keep the rule of your father and have in memory the teaching of your mother
Pro  Keep them ever folded in your heart and have them hanging round your neck
Pro  In your walking it will be your guide when you are sleeping it will keep watch over you when you are awake it will have talk with you
Pro  For the rule is a light and the teaching a shining light and the guiding words of training are the way of life
Pro  They will keep you from the evil woman from the smooth tongue of the strange woman
Pro  Let not your hearts desire go after her fair body let not her eyes take you prisoner
Pro  For a loose woman is looking for a cake of bread but another mans wife goes after ones very life
Pro  May a man take fire to his breast without burning his clothing
Pro  Or may one go on lighted coals and his feet not be burned
Pro  So it is with him who goes in to his neighbours wife he who has anything to do with her will not go free from punishment
Pro  Men do not have a low opinion of a thief who takes food when he is in need of it
Pro  But if he is taken in the act he will have to give back seven times as much giving up all his property which is in his house
Pro  He who takes another mans wife is without all sense he who does it is the cause of destruction to his soul
Pro  Wounds will be his and loss of honour and his shame may not be washed away
Pro  For bitter is the wrath of an angry husband in the day of punishment he will have no mercy
Pro  He will not take any payment and he will not make peace with you though your money offerings are increased
Pro  My son keep my sayings and let my rules be stored up with you
Pro  Keep my rules and you will have life let my teaching be to you as the light of your eyes
Pro  Let them be fixed to your fingers and recorded in your heart
Pro  Say to wisdom You are my sister let knowledge be named your special friend
Pro  So that they may keep you from the strange woman even from her whose words are smooth
Pro  Looking out from my house and watching through the window
Pro  I saw among the young men one without sense
Pro  Walking in the street near the turn of her road going on the way to her house
Pro  At nightfall in the evening of the day in the black dark of the night
Pro  And the woman came out to him in the dress of a loose woman with a designing heart
Pro  She is full of noise and uncontrolled her feet keep not in her house
Pro  Now she is in the street now in the open spaces waiting at every turning of the road
Pro  So she took him by his hand kissing him and without a sign of shame she said to him
Pro  I have a feast of peaceofferings for today my oaths have been effected
Pro  So I came out in the hope of meeting you looking for you with care and now I have you
Pro  My bed is covered with cushions of needlework with coloured cloths of the cotton thread of Egypt
Pro  I have made my bed sweet with perfumes and spices
Pro  Come let us take our pleasure in love till the morning having joy in loves delights
Pro  For the master of the house is away on a long journey
Pro  He has taken a bag of money with him he is coming back at the full moon
Pro  With her fair words she overcame him forcing him with her smooth lips
Pro  The simple man goes after her like an ox going to its death like a roe pulled by a cord
Pro  Like a bird falling into a net with no thought that his life is in danger till an arrow goes into his side
Pro  So now my sons give ear to me give attention to the sayings of my mouth
Pro  Let not your heart be turned to her ways do not go wandering in her footsteps
Pro  For those wounded and made low by her are great in number and all those who have come to their death through her are a great army
Pro  Her house is the way to the underworld going down to the rooms of death
Pro  Is not wisdom crying out and the voice of knowledge sounding
Pro  At the top of the highways at the meeting of the roads she takes her place
Pro  Where the roads go into the town her cry goes out at the doorways her voice is loud
Pro  I am crying out to you O men my voice comes to the sons of men
Pro  Become expert in reason O you simple ones you foolish ones take training to heart
Pro  Give ear for my words are true and my lips are open to give out what is upright
Pro  For good faith goes out of my mouth and false lips are disgusting to me
Pro  All the words of my mouth are righteousness there is nothing false or twisted in them
Pro  They are all true to him whose mind is awake and straightforward to those who get knowledge
Pro  Take my teaching and not silver get knowledge in place of the best gold
Pro  For wisdom is better than jewels and all things which may be desired are nothing in comparison with her
Pro  I wisdom have made wise behaviour my near relation I am seen to be the special friend of wise purposes
Pro  The fear of the Lord is seen in hating evil pride a high opinion of oneself the evil way and the false tongue are unpleasing to me
Pro  Wise design and good sense are mine reason and strength are mine
Pro  Through me kings have their power and rulers give right decisions
Pro  Through me chiefs have authority and the noble ones are judging in righteousness
Pro  Those who have given me their love are loved by me and those who make search for me with care will get me
Pro  Wealth and honour are in my hands even wealth without equal and righteousness
Pro  My fruit is better than gold even than the best gold and my increase is more to be desired than silver
Pro  I go in the road of righteousness in the way of right judging
Pro  So that I may give my lovers wealth for their heritage making their storehouses full
Pro  The Lord made me as the start of his way the first of his works in the past
Pro  From eternal days I was given my place from the birth of time before the earth was
Pro  When there was no deep I was given birth when there were no fountains flowing with water
Pro  Before the mountains were put in their places before the hills was my birth
Pro  When he had not made the earth or the fields or the dust of the world
Pro  When he made ready the heavens I was there when he put an arch over the face of the deep
Pro  When he made strong the skies overhead when the fountains of the deep were fixed
Pro  When he put a limit to the sea so that the waters might not go against his word when he put in position the bases of the earth
Pro  Then I was by his side as a master workman and I was his delight from day to day playing before him at all times
Pro  Playing in his earth and my delight was with the sons of men
Pro  Give ear to me then my sons for happy are those who keep my ways
Pro  Take my teaching and be wise do not let it go
Pro  Happy is the man who gives ear to me watching at my doors day by day keeping his place by the pillars of my house
Pro  For whoever gets me gets life and grace from the Lord will come to him
Pro  But he who does evil to me does wrong to his soul all my haters are in love with death
Pro  Wisdom has made her house putting up her seven pillars
Pro  She has put her fat beasts to death her wine is mixed her table is ready
Pro  She has sent out her womenservants her voice goes out to the highest places of the town saying
Pro  Whoever is simple let him come in here and to him who has no sense she says
Pro  Come take of my bread and of my wine which is mixed
Pro  Give up the simple ones and have life and go in the way of knowledge
Pro  He who gives teaching to a man of pride gets shame for himself he who says sharp words to a sinner gets a bad name
Pro  Do not say sharp words to a man of pride or he will have hate for you make them clear to a wise man and you will be dear to him
Pro  Give teaching to a wise man and he will become wiser give training to an upright man and his learning will be increased
Pro  The fear of the Lord is the start of wisdom and the knowledge of the Holy One gives a wise mind
Pro  For by me your days will be increased and the years of your life will be long
Pro  If you are wise you are wise for yourself if your heart is full of pride you only will have the pain of it
Pro  The foolish woman is full of noise she has no sense at all
Pro  Seated at the door of her house in the high places of the town
Pro  Crying out to those who go by going straight on their way she says
Pro  Whoever is simple let him come in here and to him who is without sense she says
Pro  Drink taken without right is sweet and food in secret is pleasing
Pro  But he does not see that the dead are there that her guests are in the deep places of the underworld
Pro  A wise son makes a glad father but a foolish son is a sorrow to his mother
Pro  Wealth which comes from sin is of no profit but righteousness gives salvation from death
Pro  The Lord will not let the upright be in need of food but he puts far from him the desire of the evildoers
Pro  He who is slow in his work becomes poor but the hand of the ready worker gets in wealth
Pro  He who in summer gets together his store is a son who does wisely but he who takes his rest when the grain is being cut is a son causing shame
Pro  Blessings are on the head of the upright but the face of sinners will be covered with sorrow
Pro  The memory of the upright is a blessing but the name of the evildoer will be turned to dust

Ecc  I got together silver and gold and the wealth of kings and of countries I got makers of song male and female and the delights of the sons of mengirls of all sorts to be my brides
Ecc  And I became great increasing more than all who had been before me in Jerusalem and my wisdom was still with me
Ecc  And nothing which was desired by my eyes did I keep from them I did not keep any joy from my heart because my heart took pleasure in all my work and this was my reward
Ecc  Then I saw all the works which my hands had made and everything I had been working to do and I saw that all was to no purpose and desire for wind and there was no profit under the sun
Ecc  And I went again in search of wisdom and of foolish ways What may the man do who comes after the king The thing which he has done before
Ecc  Then I saw that wisdom is better than foolish waysas the light is better than the dark
Ecc  The wise mans eyes are in his head but the foolish man goes walking in the dark but still I saw that the same event comes to them all
Ecc  Then said I in my heart As it comes to the foolish man so will it come to me so why have I been wise overmuch Then I said in my heart This again is to no purpose
Ecc  Of the wise man as of the foolish man there is no memory for ever seeing that those who now are will have gone from memory in the days to come See how death comes to the wise as to the foolish
Ecc  So I was hating life because everything under the sun was evil to me all is to no purpose and desire for wind
Ecc  Hate had I for all my work which I had done because the man who comes after me will have its fruits
Ecc  And who is to say if that man will be wise or foolish But he will have power over all my work which I have done and in which I have been wise under the sun This again is to no purpose
Ecc  So my mind was turned to grief for all the trouble I had taken and all my wisdom under the sun
Ecc  Because there is a man whose work has been done with wisdom with knowledge and with an expert hand but one who has done nothing for it will have it for his heritage This again is to no purpose and a great evil
Ecc  What does a man get for all his work and for the weight of care with which he has done his work under the sun
Ecc  All his days are sorrow and his work is full of grief Even in the night his heart has no rest This again is to no purpose
Ecc  There is nothing better for a man than taking meat and drink and having delight in his work This again I saw was from the hand of God
Ecc  Who may take food or have pleasure without him
Ecc  To the man with whom he is pleased God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy but to the sinner he gives the work of getting goods together and storing up wealth to give to him in whom God has pleasure This again is to no purpose and desire for wind
Ecc  For everything there is a fixed time and a time for every business under the sun
Ecc  A time for birth and a time for death a time for planting and a time for uprooting
Ecc  A time to put to death and a time to make well a time for pulling down and a time for building up
Ecc  A time for weeping and a time for laughing a time for sorrow and a time for dancing
Ecc  A time to take stones away and a time to get stones together a time for kissing and a time to keep from kissing
Ecc  A time for search and a time for loss a time to keep and a time to give away
Ecc  A time for undoing and a time for stitching a time for keeping quiet and a time for talk
Ecc  A time for love and a time for hate a time for war and a time for peace
Ecc  What profit has the worker in the work which he does
Ecc  I saw the work which God has put on the sons of man
Ecc  He has made everything right in its time but he has made their hearts without knowledge so that man is unable to see the works of God from the first to the last
Ecc  I am certain that there is nothing better for a man than to be glad and to do good while life is in him
Ecc  And for every man to take food and drink and have joy in all his work is a reward from God
Ecc  I am certain that whatever God does will be for ever No addition may be made to it nothing may be taken from it and God has done it so that man may be in fear before him
Ecc  Whatever is has been before and what is to be is now because God makes search for the things which are past
Ecc  And again I saw under the sun in the place of the judges that evil was there and in the place of righteousness that evil was there
Ecc  I said in my heart God will be judge of the good and of the bad because a time for every purpose and for every work has been fixed by him
Ecc  I said in my heart It is because of the sons of men so that God may put them to the test and that they may see themselves as beasts
Ecc  Because the fate of the sons of men and the fate of the beasts is the same As is the death of one so is the death of the other and all have one spirit Man is not higher than the beasts because all is to no purpose
Ecc  All go to one place all are of the dust and all will be turned to dust again
Ecc  Who is certain that the spirit of the sons of men goes up to heaven or that the spirit of the beasts goes down to the earth
Ecc  So I saw that there is nothing better than for a man to have joy in his workbecause that is his reward Who will make him see what will come after him
Ecc  And again I saw all the cruel things which are done under the sun there was the weeping of those who have evil done to them and they had no comforter and from the hands of the evildoers there went out power but they had no comforter
Ecc  So my praise was for the dead who have gone to their death more than for the living who still have life
Ecc  Yes happier than the dead or the living seemed he who has not ever been who has not seen the evil which is done under the sun
Ecc  And I saw that the cause of all the work and of everything which is done well was mans envy of his neighbour This again is to no purpose and a desire for wind
Ecc  The foolish man folding his hands takes the flesh of his body for food
Ecc  One hand full of rest is better than two hands full of trouble and desire for wind
Ecc  Then I came back and I saw an example of what is to no purpose under the sun
Ecc  It is one who is by himself without a second and without son or brother but there is no end to all his work and he has never enough of wealth For whom then am I working and keeping myself from pleasure This again is to no purpose and a bitter work
Ecc  Two are better than one because they have a good reward for their work
Ecc  And if one has a fall the other will give him a hand but unhappy is the man who is by himself because he has no helper
Ecc  So again if two are sleeping together they are warm but how may one be warm by himself
Ecc  And two attacked by one would be safe and three cords twisted together are not quickly broken
Ecc  A young man who is poor and wise is better than a king who is old and foolish and will not be guided by the wisdom of others
Ecc  Because out of a prison the young man comes to be king though by birth he was only a poor man in the kingdom
Ecc  I saw all the living under the sun round the young man who was to be ruler in place of the king
Ecc  There was no end of all the people of all those whose head he was but they who come later will have no delight in him This again is to no purpose and desire for wind
Ecc  Put your feet down with care when you go to the house of God for it is better to give ear than to make the burned offerings of the foolish whose knowledge is only of doing evil
Ecc  Be not unwise with your mouth and let not your heart be quick to say anything before God because God is in heaven and you are on the earthso let not the number of your words be great
Ecc  As a dream comes from much business so the voice of a foolish man comes with words in great number
Ecc  When you take an oath before God put it quickly into effect because he has no pleasure in the foolish keep the oath you have taken
Ecc  It is better not to take an oath than to take an oath and not keep it
Ecc  Let not your mouth make your flesh do evil And say not before the angel It was an error So that God may not be angry with your words and put an end to the work of your hands
Ecc  Because much talk comes from dreams and things of no purpose But let the fear of God be in you
Ecc  If you see the poor under a cruel yoke and law and right being violently overturned in a country be not surprised because one authority is keeping watch on another and there are higher than they
Ecc  It is good generally for a country where the land is worked to have a king
Ecc  He who has a love for silver never has enough silver or he who has love for wealth enough profit This again is to no purpose
Ecc  When goods are increased the number of those who take of them is increased and what profit has the owner but to see them
Ecc  The sleep of a working man is sweet if he has little food or much but to him who is full sleep will not come
Ecc  There is a great evil which I have seen under the sunwealth kept by the owner to be his downfall
Ecc  And I saw the destruction of his wealth by an evil chance and when he became the father of a son he had nothing in his hand
Ecc  As he came from his mother at birth so does he go again he gets from his work no reward which he may take away in his hand
Ecc  And this again is a great evil that in all points as he came so will he go and what profit has he in working for the wind
Ecc  All his days are in the dark and he has much sorrow pain disease and trouble
Ecc  This is what I have seen it is good and fair for a man to take meat and drink and to have joy in all his work under the sun all the days of his life which God has given him that is his reward
Ecc  Every man to whom God has given money and wealth and the power to have pleasure in it and to do his part and have joy in his work this is given by God
Ecc  He will not give much thought to the days of his life because God lets him be taken up with the joy of his heart
Ecc  There is an evil which I have seen under the sun and it is hard on men
Ecc  A man to whom God gives money wealth and honour so that he has all his desires but God does not give him the power to have joy of it and a strange man takes it This is to no purpose and an evil disease
Ecc  If a man has a hundred children and his life is long so that the days of his years are great in number but his soul takes no pleasure in good and he is not honoured at his death I say that a birth before its time is better than he
Ecc  In wind it came and to the dark it will go and with the dark will its name be covered
Ecc  Yes it saw not the sun and it had no knowledge it is better with this than with the other
Ecc  And though he goes on living a thousand years twice over and does not see good are not the two going to the same place
Ecc  All the work of man is for his mouth and still he has a desire for food
Ecc  What have the wise more than the foolish and what has the poor man by walking wisely before the living
Ecc  What the eyes see is better than the wandering of desire This is to no purpose and a desire for wind
Ecc  That which is has been named before and of what man is there is knowledge He has no power against one stronger than he
Ecc  There are words without number for increasing what is to no purpose but what is man profited by them
Ecc  Who is able to say what is good for man in life all the days of his foolish life which he goes through like a shade who will say what is to be after him under the sun
Ecc  A good name is better than oil of great price and the day of death than the day of birth
Ecc  It is better to go to the house of weeping than to go to the house of feasting because that is the end of every man and the living will take it to their hearts
Ecc  Sorrow is better than joy when the face is sad the mind gets better
Ecc  The hearts of the wise are in the house of weeping but the hearts of the foolish are in the house of joy
Ecc  It is better to take note of the protest of the wise than for a man to give ear to the song of the foolish
Ecc  Like the cracking of thorns under a pot so is the laugh of a foolish man and this again is to no purpose
Ecc  The wise are troubled by the ways of the cruel and the giving of money is the destruction of the heart
Ecc  The end of a thing is better than its start and a gentle spirit is better than pride
Ecc  Be not quick to let your spirit be angry because wrath is in the heart of the foolish
Ecc  Say not Why were the days which have gone by better than these Such a question comes not from wisdom
Ecc  Wisdom together with a heritage is good and a profit to those who see the sun
Ecc  Wisdom keeps a man from danger even as money does but the value of knowledge is that wisdom gives life to its owner
Ecc  Give thought to the work of God Who will make straight what he has made bent
Ecc  In the day of wealth have joy but in the day of evil take thought God has put the one against the other so that man may not be certain what will be after him
Ecc  These two have I seen in my life which is to no purpose a good man coming to his end in his righteousness and an evil man whose days are long in his evildoing
Ecc  Be not given overmuch to righteousness and be not overwise Why let destruction come on you
Ecc  Be not evil overmuch and be not foolish Why come to your end before your time
Ecc  It is good to take this in your hand and not to keep your hand from that he who has the fear of God will be free of the two
Ecc  Wisdom makes a wise man stronger than ten rulers in a town
Ecc  There is no man on earth of such righteousness that he does good and is free from sin all his days
Ecc  Do not give ear to all the words which men say for fear of hearing the curses of your servant
Ecc  Your heart has knowledge how frequently others have been cursed by you
Ecc  All this I have put to the test by wisdom I said I will be wise but it was far from me
Ecc  Far off is true existence and very deep who may have knowledge of it
Ecc  I gave my mind to knowledge and to searching for wisdom and the reason of things and to the discovery that sin is foolish and that to be foolish is to be without ones senses
Ecc  And I saw a thing more bitter than death even the woman whose heart is full of tricks and nets and whose hands are as bands He with whom God is pleased will get free from her but the sinner will be taken by her
Ecc  Look this I have seen said the Preacher taking one thing after another to get the true account
Ecc  For which my soul is still searching but I have it not one man among a thousand have I seen but a woman among all these I have not seen
Ecc  This only have I seen that God made men upright but they have been searching out all sorts of inventions
Ecc  Who is like the wise man and to whom is the sense of anything clear A mans wisdom makes his face shining and his hard face will be changed
Ecc  I say to you Keep the kings law from respect for the oath of God
Ecc  Be not quick to go from before him Be not fixed in an evil design because he does whatever is pleasing to him
Ecc  The word of a king has authority and who may say to him What is this you are doing
Ecc  Whoever keeps the law will come to no evil and a wise mans heart has knowledge of time and of decision
Ecc  For every purpose there is a time and a decision because the sorrow of man is great in him
Ecc  No one is certain what is to be and who is able to say to him when it will be
Ecc  No man has authority over the wind to keep the wind or is ruler over the day of his death In war no mans time is free and evil will not keep the sinner safe
Ecc  All this have I seen and have given my heart to all the work which is done under the sun there is a time when man has power over man for his destruction
Ecc  And then I saw evil men put to rest taken even from the holy place and they went about and were praised in the town because of what they had done This again is to no purpose
Ecc  Because punishment for an evil work comes not quickly the minds of the sons of men are fully given to doing evil
Ecc  Though a sinner does evil a hundred times and his life is long I am certain that it will be well for those who go in fear of God and are in fear before him
Ecc  But it will not be well for the evildoer he will not make his days long like a shade because he has no fear before God
Ecc  There is a thing which is to no purpose done on the earth that there are good men to whom is given the same punishment as those who are evil and there are evil men who get the reward of the good I say that this again is to no purpose
Ecc  So I gave praise to joy because there is nothing better for a man to do under the sun than to take meat and drink and be happy for that will be with him in his work all the days of his life which God gives him under the sun
Ecc  When I gave my mind to the knowledge of wisdom and to seeing the business which is done on the earth and there are those whose eyes see not sleep by day or by night
Ecc  Then I saw all the work of God and that man may not get knowledge of the work which is done under the sun because if a man gives hard work to the search he will not get knowledge and even if the wise man seems to be coming to the end of his search still he will be without knowledge
Ecc  All this I took to heart and my heart saw it all that the upright and the wise and their works are in the hand of God and men may not be certain if it will be love or hate all is to no purpose before them
Ecc  Because to all there is one event to the upright man and to the evil to the clean and to the unclean to him who makes an offering and to him who makes no offering as is the good so is the sinner he who takes an oath is as he who has fear of it
Ecc  This is evil in all things which are done under the sun that there is one fate for all and the hearts of the sons of men are full of evil while they have life their hearts are foolish and after thatto the dead
Ecc  For him who is joined to all the living there is hope a living dog is better than a dead lion
Ecc  The living are conscious that death will come to them but the dead are not conscious of anything and they no longer have a reward because there is no memory of them
Ecc  Their love and their hate and their envy are now ended and they have no longer a part for ever in anything which is done under the sun
Ecc  Come take your bread with joy and your wine with a glad heart God has taken pleasure in your works
Ecc  Let your clothing be white at all times and let not your head be without oil
Ecc  Have joy with the woman of your love all the days of your foolish life which he gives you under the sun Because that is your part in life and in your work which you do under the sun
Ecc  Whatever comes to your hand to do with all your power do it because there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom in the place of the dead to which you are going
Ecc  And again I saw under the sun that the reward goes not to him who is quick or the fruits of war to the strong and there is no bread for the wise or wealth for men of learning or respect for those who have knowledge but time and chance come to all
Ecc  Even man has no knowledge of his time like fishes taken in an evil net or like birds taken by deceit are the sons of men taken in an evil time when it comes suddenly on them
Ecc  This again I have seen under the sun as wisdom and it seemed great to me
Ecc  There was a little town and the number of its men was small and there came a great king against it and made an attack on it building works of war round about it
Ecc  Now there was in the town a poor wise man and he by his wisdom kept the town safe But no one had any memory of that same poor man
Ecc  Then I said Wisdom is better than strength but the poor mans wisdom is not respected and his words are not given a hearing
Ecc  The words of the wise which come quietly to the ear are noted more than the cry of a ruler among the foolish
Ecc  Wisdom is better than instruments of war but one sinner is the destruction of much good
Ecc  Dead flies make the oil of the perfumer give out an evil smell more valued is a little wisdom than the great glory of the foolish
Ecc  The heart of the wise man goes in the right direction but the heart of a foolish man in the wrong
Ecc  And when the foolish man is walking in the way he has no sense and lets everyone see that he is foolish
Ecc  If the wrath of the ruler is against you keep in your place in him who keeps quiet even great sins may be overlooked
Ecc  There is an evil which I have seen under the sun like an error which comes by chance from a ruler
Ecc  The foolish are placed in high positions but men of wealth are kept low
Ecc  I have seen servants on horses and rulers walking on the earth as servants
Ecc  He who makes a hole for others will himself go into it and for him who makes a hole through a wall the bite of a snake will be a punishment
Ecc  He who gets out stones from the earth will be damaged by them and in the cutting of wood there is danger
Ecc  If the iron has no edge and he does not make it sharp then he has to put out more strength but wisdom makes things go well
Ecc  If a snake gives a bite before the word of power is said then there is no longer any use in the word of power
Ecc  The words of a wise mans mouth are sweet to all but the lips of a foolish man are his destruction
Ecc  The first words of his mouth are foolish and the end of his talk is evil crime
Ecc  The foolish are full of words man has no knowledge of what will be and who is able to say what will be after him
Ecc  The work of the foolish will be a weariness to him because he has no knowledge of the way to the town
Ecc  Unhappy is the land whose king is a boy and whose rulers are feasting in the morning
Ecc  Happy is the land whose ruler is of noble birth and whose chiefs take food at the right time for strength and not for feasting
Ecc  When no work is done the roof goes in and when the hands do nothing water comes into the house
Ecc  A feast is for laughing and wine makes glad the heart but by the one and the other money is wasted
Ecc  Say not a curse against the king even in your thoughts and even secretly say not a curse against the man of wealth because a bird of the air will take the voice and that which has wings will give news of it
Ecc  Put out your bread on the face of the waters for after a long time it will come back to you again
Ecc  Give a part to seven or even to eight because you have no knowledge of the evil which will be on the earth
Ecc  If the clouds are full of rain they send it down on the earth and if a tree comes down to the south or the north in whatever place it comes down there it will be
Ecc  He who is watching the wind will not get the seed planted and he who is looking at the clouds will not get in the grain
Ecc  As you have no knowledge of the way of the wind or of the growth of the bones in the body of her who is with child even so you have no knowledge of the works of God who has made all
Ecc  In the morning put your seed into the earth and till the evening let not your hand be at rest because you are not certain which will do well this or thator if the two will be equally good
Ecc  Truly the light is sweet and it is good for the eyes to see the sun
Ecc  But even if a mans life is long and he has joy in all his years let him keep in mind the dark days because they will be great in number Whatever may come is to no purpose
Ecc  Have joy O young man while you are young and let your heart be glad in the days of your strength and go in the ways of your heart and in the desire of your eyes but be certain that for all these things God will be your judge
Ecc  So put away trouble from your heart and sorrow from your flesh because the early years and the best years are to no purpose
Ecc  Let your mind be turned to your Maker in the days of your strength while the evil days come not and the years are far away when you will say I have no pleasure in them
Ecc  While the sun or the light or the moon or the stars are not dark and the clouds come not back after the rain
Ecc  In the day when the keepers of the house are shaking for fear and the strong men are bent down and the women who were crushing the grain are at rest because their number is small and those looking out of the windows are unable to see
Ecc  When the doors are shut in the street and the sound of the crushing is low and the voice of the bird is soft and the daughters of music will be made low
Ecc  And he is in fear of that which is high and danger is in the road and the tree is white with flower and the least thing is a weight and desire is at an end because man goes to his last restingplace and those who are sorrowing are in the streets
Ecc  Before ever the silver cord is cut or the vessel of gold is broken or the pot is broken at the fountain or the wheel broken at the waterhole
Ecc  And the dust goes back to the earth as it was and the spirit goes back to God who gave it
Ecc  All things are to no purpose says the Preacher all is to no purpose
Ecc  And because the Preacher was wise he still gave the people knowledge searching out testing and putting in order a great number of wise sayings
Ecc  The Preacher made search for words which were pleasing but his writing was in words upright and true
Ecc  The words of the wise are pointed and sayings grouped together are like nails fixed with a hammer they are given by one guide
Ecc  And further my son take note of this of the making of books there is no end and much learning is a weariness to the flesh
Ecc  This is the last word All has been said Have fear of God and keep his laws because this is right for every man
Ecc  God will be judge of every work with every secret thing good or evil
Son  The song of Songs which is Solomons
Son  Let him give me the kisses of his mouth for his love is better than wine
Son  Sweet is the smell of your perfumes your name is as perfume running out so the young girls give you their love
Son  Take me to you and we will go after you the king has taken me into his house We will be glad and full of joy in you we will give more thought to your love than to wine rightly are they your lovers
Son  I am dark but fair of form O daughters of Jerusalem as the tents of Kedar as the curtains of Solomon
Son  Let not your eyes be turned on me because I am dark because I was looked on by the sun my mothers children were angry with me they made me the keeper of the vinegardens but my vinegarden I have not kept
Son  Say O love of my soul where you give food to your flock and where you make them take their rest in the heat of the day why have I to be as one wandering by the flocks of your friends
Son  If you have not knowledge O most beautiful among women go on your way in the footsteps of the flock and give your young goats food by the tents of the keepers
Son  I have made a comparison of you O my love to a horse in Pharaohs carriages
Son  Your face is a delight with rings of hair your neck with chains of jewels
Son  We will make you chains of gold with ornaments of silver
Son  While the king is seated at his table my spices send out their perfume
Son  As a bag of myrrh is my wellloved one to me when he is at rest all night between my breasts
Son  My love is to me as a branch of the cypresstree in the vinegardens of Engedi
Son  See you are fair my love you are fair you have the eyes of a dove
Son  See you are fair my loved one and a pleasure our bed is green
Son  Cedartrees are the pillars of our house and our boards are made of firtrees
Son  I am a rose of Sharon a flower of the valleys
Son  As the lilyflower among the thorns of the waste so is my love among the daughters
Son  As the appletree among the trees of the wood so is my loved one among the sons I took my rest under his shade with great delight and his fruit was sweet to my taste
Son  He took me to the house of wine and his flag over me was love
Son  Make me strong with winecakes let me be comforted with apples I am overcome with love
Son  His left hand is under my head and his right hand is round about me
Son  I say to you O daughters of Jerusalem by the roes of the field do not let love be moved till it is ready
Son  The voice of my loved one See he comes dancing on the mountains stepping quickly on the hills
Son  My loved one is like a roe see he is on the other side of our wall he is looking in at the windows letting himself be seen through the spaces
Son  My loved one said to me Get up my love my fair one and come away
Son  For see the winter is past the rain is over and gone
Son  The flowers are come on the earth the time of cutting the vines is come and the voice of the dove is sounding in our land
Son  The figtree puts out her green fruit and the vines with their young fruit give a good smell Get up from your bed my beautiful one and come away
Son  O my dove you are in the holes of the mountain sides in the cracks of the high hills let me see your face let your voice come to my ears for sweet is your voice and your face is fair
Son  Take for us the foxes the little foxes which do damage to the vines our vines have young grapes
Son  My loved one is mine and I am his he takes his food among the flowers
Son  Till the evening comes and the sky slowly becomes dark come my loved one and be like a roe on the mountains of Bether
Son  By night on my bed I was looking for him who is the love of my soul I was looking for him but I did not see him
Son  I will get up now and go about the town in the streets and in the wide ways I will go after him who is the love of my soul I went after him but I did not see him
Son  The watchmen who go about the town came by me to them I said Have you seen him who is my hearts desire
Son  I was but a little way from them when I came face to face with him who is the love of my soul I took him by the hands and did not let him go till I had taken him into my mothers house and into the room of her who gave me birth
Son  I say to you O daughters of Jerusalem by the roes of the field let not love be moved till it is ready
Son  Who is this coming out of the waste places like pillars of smoke perfumed with sweet spices with all the spices of the trader
Son  See it is the bed of Solomon sixty men of war are about it of the army of Israel
Son  All of them armed with swords trained in war every man has his sword at his side because of fear in the night
Son  King Solomon made himself a bed of the wood of Lebanon
Son  He made its pillars of silver its base of gold its seat of purple the middle of it of ebony
Son  Go out O daughters of Jerusalem and see King Solomon with the crown which his mother put on his head on the day when he was married and on the day of the joy of his heart
Son  See you are fair my love you are fair you have the eyes of a dove your hair is as a flock of goats which take their rest on the side of Gilead
Son  Your teeth are like a flock of sheep whose wool is newly cut which come up from the washing every one has two lambs and there is not one without young
Son  Your red lips are like a bright thread and your mouth is fair of form the sides of your head are like pomegranate fruit under your veil
Son  Your neck is like the tower of David made for a storehouse of arms in which a thousand breastplates are hanging breastplates for fightingmen
Son  Your two breasts are like two young roes of the same birth which take their food among the lilies
Son  Till the evening comes and the sky slowly becomes dark I will go to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense
Son  You are all fair my love there is no mark on you
Son  Come with me from Lebanon my bride with me from Lebanon see from the top of Amana from the top of Senir and Hermon from the places of the lions from the mountains of the leopards
Son  You have taken away my heart my sister my bride you have taken away my heart with one look you have taken it with one chain of your neck
Son  How fair is your love my sister How much better is your love than wine and the smell of your oils than any perfume
Son  Your lips are dropping honey honey and milk are under your tongue and the smell of your clothing is like the smell of Lebanon
Son  A garden walledin is my sister my bride a garden shut up a spring of water stopped
Son  The produce of the garden is pomegranates with all the best fruits henna and spikenard
Son  Spikenard and safron calamus and cinnamon with all trees of frankincense myrrh and aloes with all the chief spices
Son  You are a fountain of gardens a spring of living waters and flowing waters from Lebanon
Son  Be awake O north wind and come O south blowing on my garden so that its spices may come out Let my loved one come into his garden and take of his good fruits
Son  I have come into my garden my sister my bride to take my myrrh with my spice my wax with my honey my wine with my milk Take meat O friends take wine yes be overcome with love
Son  I am sleeping but my heart is awake it is the sound of my loved one at the door saying Be open to me my sister my love my dove my very beautiful one my head is wet with dew and my hair with the drops of the night
Son  I have put off my coat how may I put it on My feet are washed how may I make them unclean
Son  My loved one put his hand on the door and my heart was moved for him
Son  I got up to let my loved one in and my hands were dropping with myrrh and my fingers with liquid myrrh on the lock of the door
Son  I made the door open to my loved one but my loved one had taken himself away and was gone my soul was feeble when his back was turned on me I went after him but I did not come near him I said his name but he gave me no answer
Son  The keepers who go about the town overtook me they gave me blows and wounds the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me
Son  I say to you O daughters of Jerusalem if you see my loved one what will you say to him That I am overcome with love
Son  What is your loved one more than another O fairest among women What is your loved one more than another that you say this to us
Son  My loved one is white and red the chief among ten thousand
Son  His head is as the most delicate gold his hair is thick and black as a raven
Son  His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the water streams washed with milk and rightly placed
Son  His face is as beds of spices giving out perfumes of every sort his lips like lilies dropping liquid myrrh
Son  His hands are as rings of gold ornamented with berylstones his body is as a smooth plate of ivory covered with sapphires
Son  His legs are as pillars of stone on a base of delicate gold his looks are as Lebanon beautiful as the cedartree
Son  His mouth is most sweet yes he is all beautiful This is my loved one and this is my friend O daughters of Jerusalem
Son  Where is your loved one gone O most fair among women Where is your loved one turned away that we may go looking for him with you
Son  My loved one is gone down into his garden to the beds of spices to take food in the gardens and to get lilies
Son  I am for my loved one and my loved one is for me he takes food among the lilies
Son  You are beautiful O my love as Tirzah as fair as Jerusalem you are to be feared like an army with flags
Son  Let your eyes be turned away from me see they have overcome me your hair is as a flock of goats which take their rest on the side of Gilead
Son  Your teeth are like a flock of sheep which come up from the washing every one has two lambs and there is not one without young
Son  Like pomegranate fruit are the sides of your head under your veil
Son  There are sixty queens and eighty servantwives and young girls without number
Son  My dove my very beautiful one is but one she is the only one of her mother she is the dearest one of her who gave her birth The daughters saw her and gave her a blessing yes the queens and the servantwives and they gave her praises
Son  Who is she looking down as the morning light fair as the moon clear as the sun who is to be feared like an army with flags
Son  I went down into the garden of nuts to see the green plants of the valley and to see if the vine was in bud and the pomegranatetrees were in flower
Son  Before I was conscious of it 
Son  Come back come back O Shulammite come back come back so that our eyes may see you What will you see in the Shulammite A sworddance
Son  How beautiful are your feet in their shoes O kings daughter The curves of your legs are like jewels the work of the hands of a good workman
Son  Your stomach is a store of grain with lilies round it and in the middle a round cup full of wine
Son  Your two breasts are like two young roes of the same birth
Son  Your neck is as a tower of ivory your eyes like the waters in Heshbon by the doorway of Bathrabbim your nose is as the tower on Lebanon looking over Damascus
Son  Your head is like Carmel and the hair of your head is like purple in whose net the king is prisoner
Son  How beautiful and how sweet you are O love for delight
Son  You are tall like a palmtree and your breasts are like the fruit of the vine
Son  I said Let me go up the palmtree and let me take its branches in my hands your breasts will be as the fruit of the vine and the smell of your breath like apples
Son  And the roof of your mouth like good wine flowing down smoothly for my loved one moving gently over my lips and my teeth
Son  I am for my loved one and his desire is for me
Son  Come my loved one let us go out into the field let us take rest among the cypresstrees
Son  Let us go out early to the vinegardens let us see if the vine is in bud if it has put out its young fruit and the pomegranate is in flower There I will give you my love
Son  The mandrakes give out a sweet smell and at our doors are all sorts of good fruits new and old which I have kept for my loved one
Son  Oh that you were my brother who took milk from my mothers breasts When I came to you in the street I would give you kisses yes I would not be looked down on
Son  I would take you by the hand into my mothers house and she would be my teacher I would give you drink of spiced wine drink of the pomegranate
Son  His left hand would be under my head and his right hand about me
Son  I say to you O daughters of Jerusalem do not let love be moved till it is ready
Son  Who is this who comes up from the waste places resting on her loved one It was I who made you awake under the appletree where your mother gave you birth there she was in pain at your birth
Son  Put me as a sign on your heart as a sign on your arm love is strong as death and wrath bitter as the underworld its coals are coals of fire violent are its flames
Son  Much water may not put out love or the deep waters overcome it if a man would give all the substance of his house for love it would be judged a price not great enough
Son  We have a young sister and she has no breasts what are we to do for our sister in the day when she is given to a man
Son  If she is a wall we will make on her a strong base of silver and if she is a door we will let her be shut up with cedarwood
Son  I am a wall and my breasts are like towers then was I in his eyes as one to whom good chance had come
Son  Solomon had a vinegarden at Baalhamon he let out the vinegarden to keepers every one had to give a thousand bits of silver for its fruit
Son  My vinegarden which is mine is before me you O Solomon will have the thousand and those who keep the fruit of them two hundred
Son  You who have your restingplace in the gardens the friends give ear to your voice make me give ear to it
Son  Come quickly my loved one and be like a roe on the mountains of spice
Isa  The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz which he saw about Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah Jotham Ahaz and Hezekiah kings of Judah
Isa  Give ear O heavens and you O earth to the word which the Lord has said I have taken care of my children till they became men but their hearts have been turned away from me
Isa  Even the ox has knowledge of its owner and the ass of the place where its master puts its food but Israel has no knowledge my people give no thought to me
Isa  O nation full of sin a people weighted down with crime a generation of evildoers falsehearted children they have gone away from the Lord they have no respect for the Holy One of Israel their hearts are turned back from him
Isa  Why will you have more and more punishment why keep on in your evil ways Every head is tired and every heart is feeble
Isa  The body from head to foot is all diseased it is a mass of open wounds marks of blows and broken flesh the flow of blood has not been stopped and no oil has been put on the wounds
Isa  Your country has become waste your towns are burned with fire as for your land it is overturned before your eyes made waste and overcome by men from strange lands
Isa  And the daughter of Zion has become like a tent in a vinegarden like a watchmans house in a field of fruit like a town shut in by armies
Isa  If the Lord of armies had not kept some at least of us safe we would have been like Sodom and the fate of Gomorrah would have been ours
Isa  Give ear to the word of the Lord you rulers of Sodom let your hearts be turned to the law of our God you people of Gomorrah
Isa  What use to me is the number of the offerings which you give me says the Lord your burned offerings of sheep and the best parts of fat cattle are a weariness to me I take no pleasure in the blood of oxen or of lambs or of hegoats
Isa  At whose request do you come before me making my house unclean with your feet
Isa  Give me no more false offerings the smoke of burning flesh is disgusting to me so are your new moons and Sabbaths and your holy meetings
Isa  Your new moons and your regular feasts are a grief to my soul they are a weight in my spirit I am crushed under them
Isa  And when your hands are stretched out to me my eyes will be turned away from you even though you go on making prayers I will not give ear your hands are full of blood
Isa  Be washed make yourselves clean put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes let there be an end of sinning
Isa  Take pleasure in welldoing let your ways be upright keep down the cruel give a right decision for the child who has no father see to the cause of the widow
Isa  Come now and let us have an argument together says the Lord how may your sins which are red like blood be white as snow how may their dark purple seem like wool
Isa  If you will give ear to my word and do it the good things of the land will be yours
Isa  But if your hearts are turned against me I will send destruction on you by the sword so the Lord has said
Isa  The upright town has become untrue there was a time when her judges gave right decisions when righteousness had a restingplace in her but now she is full of those who take mens lives
Isa  Your silver is no longer true metal your wine is mixed with water
Isa  Your chiefs have gone against the Lord they have become friends of thieves every one of them is looking for profit and going after rewards they do not give right decisions for the child who has no father and they do not let the cause of the widow come before them
Isa  For this reason the Lord the Lord of armies the Strong One of Israel has said I will put an end to my haters and send punishment on those who are against me
Isa  And my hand will again be on you washing away what is unclean as with soap and taking away all your false metal
Isa  And I will give you judges again as at the first and wise guides as in the past then you will be named The Town of Righteousness the true town
Isa  Upright acts will be the price of Zions forgiveness and by righteousness will men be living there
Isa  But a common destruction will overtake sinners and evildoers together and those who have gone away from the Lord will be cut off
Isa  For you will be put to shame because of the trees of your desire and because of the gardens of your pleasure
Isa  For you will be like a tree whose leaves have become dry and like a garden without water
Isa  And the strong will be as food for the fire and his work as a flame and they will be burned together with no one to put out the fire
Isa  The word which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw about Judah and Jerusalem
Isa  And it will come about in the last days that the mountain of the Lord will be placed on the top of the mountains and be lifted up over the hills and all nations will come to it
Isa  And the peoples will say Come and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord to the house of the God of Jacob and he will give us knowledge of his ways and we will be guided by his word for out of Zion the law will go out and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem
Isa  And he will be the judge between the nations and the peoples will be ruled by his decisions and their swords will be turned into ploughblades and their spears into vineknives no longer will the nations be turning their swords against one another and the knowledge of war will be gone for ever
Isa  O family of Jacob come and let us go in the light of the Lord
Isa  For you O Lord have given up your people the family of Jacob because they are full of the evil ways of the east and make use of secret arts like the Philistines and are friends with the children of strange countries
Isa  And their land is full of silver and gold and there is no end to their stores their land is full of horses and there is no end to their carriages
Isa  Their land is full of images they give worship to the work of their hands even to that which their fingers have made
Isa  And the poor mans head is bent and the great man goes down on his face for this cause there will be no forgiveness for their sin
Isa  Go into a hole in the rock covering yourselves with dust in fear of the Lord before the glory of his power
Isa  The high looks of man will be put to shame and the pride of men will be made low and only the Lord will be lifted up in that day
Isa  For the day of the Lord of armies is coming on all the pride of men and on all who are high and lifted up
Isa  And on all the high trees of Lebanon and on all the strong trees of Bashan
Isa  And on all the high mountains and on all the hills which are lifted up
Isa  And on every high tower and on every strong wall
Isa  And on all the ships of Tarshish and on all the fair boats
Isa  And the high looks of man will be put to shame and the pride of men will be made low and only the Lord will be lifted up in that day
Isa  And the images will never be seen again
Isa  And men will go into cracks of the rocks and into holes of the earth for fear of the Lord and before the glory of his power when he comes out of his place shaking the earth with his strength
Isa  In that day men will put their images of silver and of gold which they made for worship in the keeping of the beasts of the dark places
Isa  To take cover in the cracks of the rocks and in the holes of the hills for fear of the Lord and before the glory of his power when he comes out of his place shaking the earth with his strength
Isa  Have no more to do with man whose life is only a breath for he is of no value
Isa  For the Lord the Lord of armies is about to take away from Jerusalem and from Judah all their support their store of bread and of water
Isa  The strong man and the man of war the judge and the prophet the man who has knowledge of secret arts and the man who is wise because of his years
Isa  The captain of fifty and the man of high position and the wise guide and the wonderworker and he who makes use of secret powers
Isa  And I will make children their chiefs and foolish ones will have rule over them
Isa  And the people will be crushed every one by his neighbour the young will be full of pride against the old and those of low position will be lifted up against the noble
Isa  When one man puts his hand on another in his fathers house and says You have clothing be our ruler and be responsible for us in our sad condition
Isa  Then he will say with an oath I will not be a helper for in my house there is no bread or clothing I will not let you make me a ruler of the people
Isa  For Jerusalem has become feeble and destruction has come on Judah because their words and their acts are against the Lord moving the eyes of his glory to wrath
Isa  Their respect for a mans position is a witness against them and their sin is open to the view of all like that of Sodom it is not covered A curse on their soul for the measure of their sin is full
Isa  Happy is the upright man for he will have joy of the fruit of his ways
Isa  Unhappy is the sinner for the reward of his evil doings will come on him
Isa  As for my people their ruler is acting like a child and those who have authority over them are women O my people your guides are the cause of your wandering turning your footsteps out of the right way
Isa  The Lord is ready to take up his cause against his people and is about to come forward as their judge
Isa  The Lord comes to be the judge of their responsible men and of their rulers it is you who have made waste the vinegarden and in your houses is the property of the poor which you have taken by force
Isa  By what right are you crushing my people and putting a bitter yoke on the necks of the poor This is the word of the Lord the Lord of armies
Isa  Again the Lord has said Because the daughters of Zion are full of pride and go with outstretched necks and wandering eyes with their footchains sounding when they go
Isa  The Lord will send disease on the heads of the daughters of Zion and the Lord will let their secret parts be seen
Isa  In that day the Lord will take away the glory of their footrings and their sunjewels and their moonornaments
Isa  The earrings and the chains and the delicate clothing
Isa  The headbands and the armchains and the worked bands and the perfumeboxes and the jewels with secret powers
Isa  The rings and the nosejewels
Isa  The feastday dresses and the robes and the wide skirts and the handbags
Isa  The lookingglasses and the fair linen and the high headdresses and the veils
Isa  And in the place of sweet spices will be an evil smell and for a fair band a thick cord for a welldressed head there will be the cuttingoff of the hair and for a beautiful robe there will be the clothing of sorrow the mark of the prisoner in place of the ornaments of the free
Isa  Your men will be put to the sword and your men of war will come to destruction in the fight
Isa  And in the public places of her towns will be sorrow and weeping and she will be seated on the earth waste and uncovered
Isa  And in that day seven women will put their hands on one man saying There will be no need for you to give us food or clothing only let us go under your name so that our shame may be taken away
Isa  In that day will the young growth of the Lord be beautiful in glory and the fruit of the earth will be the pride of those who are still living in Israel
Isa  And it will come about that the rest of the living in Zion and of those who have been kept from destruction in Jerusalem will be named holy even everyone who has been recorded for life in Jerusalem
Isa  When Zion has been washed from her sin by the Lord and Jerusalem made clean from her blood by a judging and a burning wind
Isa  And over every livingplace on Mount Zion all over all her meetings the Lord will make a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night for over all the glory of the Lord will be a cover and a tent
Isa  And a shade in the daytime from the heat and a safe cover from storm and from rain
Isa  Let me make a song about my loved one a song of love for his vinegarden My loved one had a vinegarden on a fertile hill
Isa  And after working the earth of it with a spade he took away its stones and put in it a very special vine and he put up a watchtower in the middle of it hollowing out in the rock a place for the grapecrushing and he was hoping that it would give the best grapes but it gave common grapes
Isa  And now you people of Jerusalem and you men of Judah be the judges between me and my vinegarden
Isa  Is there anything which might have been done for my vinegarden which I have not done why then when I was hoping for the best grapes did it give me common grapes
Isa  And now this is what I will do to my vinegarden I will take away the circle of thorns round it and it will be burned up its wall will be broken down and the beasts of the field will go through it
Isa  And I will make it waste its branches will not be touched with the knife or the earth worked with the spade but blackberries and thorns will come up in it and I will give orders to the clouds not to send rain on it
Isa  For the vinegarden of the Lord of armies is the people of Israel and the men of Judah are the plant of his delight and he was looking for upright judging and there was blood for righteousness and there was a cry for help
Isa  Cursed are those who are joining house to house and putting field to field till there is no more livingspace for any but themselves in all the land
Isa  The Lord of armies has said to me secretly Truly numbers of great and fair houses will be waste with no one living in them
Isa  For ten fields of vines will only give one measure of wine and a great amount of seed will only give a small measure of grain
Isa  Cursed are those who get up early in the morning to give themselves up to strong drink who keep on drinking far into the night till they are heated with wine
Isa  And corded instruments and windinstruments and wine are in their feasts but they give no thought to the work of the Lord and they are not interested in what his hands are doing
Isa  For this cause my people are taken away as prisoners into strange countries for need of knowledge and their rulers are wasted for need of food and their loudvoiced feasters are dry for need of water
Isa  For this cause the underworld has made wide its throat opening its mouth without limit and her glory and the noise of her masses and her loudvoiced feasters will go down into it
Isa  And the poor mans head is bent and the great man goes down on his face and the eyes of pride are put to shame
Isa  But the Lord of armies is lifted up as judge and the Holy God is seen to be holy in righteousness
Isa  Then the lambs will get food as in their grasslands and the fat cattle will be feasting in the waste places
Isa  Cursed are those who make use of oxcords for pulling the evil thing and the bands of a young ox for their sin
Isa  Who say Let him do his work quickly let him make it sudden so that we may see it let the design of the Holy One of Israel come near so that it may be clear to us
Isa  Cursed are those who give the name of good to evil and of evil to what is good who make light dark and dark light who make bitter sweet and sweet bitter
Isa  Cursed are those who seem wise to themselves and who take pride in their knowledge
Isa  Cursed are those who are strong to take wine and great in making mixed drinks
Isa  Who for a reward give support to the cause of the sinner and who take away the righteousness of the upright from him
Isa  For this cause as the waste of the grain is burned up by tongues of fire and as the dry grass goes down before the flame so their root will be like the dry stems of grain and their flower will go up in dust because they have gone against the law of the Lord of armies and have given no honour to the word of the Holy One of Israel
Isa  For this reason the wrath of the Lord has been burning against his people and his hand has been stretched out against them in punishment and the hills were shaking and their dead bodies were like waste in the open places of the town
Isa  And he will let a flag be lifted up as a sign to a faroff nation whistling to them from the ends of the earth and they will come quickly and suddenly
Isa  There is no weariness among them and no man is feeblefooted they come without resting or sleeping and the cord of their shoes is not broken
Isa  Their arrows are sharp and every bow is bent the feet of their horses are like rock and their wheels are like a rushing storm
Isa  The sound of their armies will be like the voice of a lion and their warcry like the noise of young lions with loud cries they will come down on their food and will take it away safely and there will be no one to take it out of their hands
Isa  And his voice will be loud over him in that day like the sounding of the sea and if a mans eyes are turned to the earth it is all dark and full of trouble and the light is made dark by thick clouds
Isa  In the year of King Uzziahs death I saw the Lord seated in his place high and lifted up and the Temple was full of the wide skirts of his robe
Isa  Over him were the winged ones every one had six wings two for covering his face two for covering his feed and two for flight
Isa  And one said in a loud voice to another Holy holy holy is the Lord of armies all the earth is full of his glory
Isa  And the bases of the doorpillars were shaking at the sound of his cry and the house was full of smoke
Isa  Then I said The curse is on me and my fate is destruction for I am a man of unclean lips living among a people of unclean lips for my eyes have seen the King the Lord of armies
Isa  Then a winged one came to me with a burning coal in his hand which he had taken from off the altar with the firespoon
Isa  And after touching my mouth with it he said See your lips have been touched with this and your evil is taken away and you are made clean from sin
Isa  And the voice of the Lord came to my ears saying Whom am I to send and who will go for us Then I said Here am I send me
Isa  And he said Go and say to this people You will go on hearing but learning nothing you will go on seeing but without getting wiser
Isa  Make the hearts of this people fat and let their ears be stopped and their eyes shut for fear that they may see with their eyes and be hearing with their ears and their heart may become wise and they may be turned to me and made well
Isa  Then I said Lord how long And he said in answer Till the towns are waste and unpeopled and the houses have no men and the land becomes completely waste
Isa  And the Lord has taken men far away and there are wide waste places in the land
Isa  And even if there is still a tenth part in it it will again be burned like a tree of the woods whose broken end is still in the earth after the tree has been cut down the holy seed is the broken end
Isa  Now it came about in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah that Rezin the king of Aram and Pekah the son of Remaliah the king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to make war against it but were not able to overcome it
Isa  And word came to the family of David that Aram had put up its tents in Ephraim And the kings heart and the hearts of his people were moved like the trees of the wood shaking in the wind
Isa  Then the Lord said to Isaiah Go out now you and Shearjashub your son and you will come across Ahaz at the end of the stream flowing from the higher pool in the highway of the washermans field
Isa  And say to him Take care and be quiet have no fear and do not let your heart be feeble because of these two ends of smoking firewood because of the bitter wrath of Rezin and Aram and of the son of Remaliah
Isa  Because Aram has made evil designs against you saying
Isa  Let us go up against Judah troubling her and forcing our way into her and let us put up a king in her even the son of Tabeel
Isa  This is the word of the Lord God This design will not come about or be effected
Isa  For the head of Aram is Damascus and the head of Damascus is Rezin and in sixtyfive years from now Ephraim will be broken and will no longer be a people
Isa  And the head of Ephraim is Samaria and the head of Samaria is Remaliahs son If you will not have faith your kingdom will be broken
Isa  And Isaiah said again to Ahaz
Isa  Make a request to the Lord your God for a sign a sign in the deep places of the underworld or in the high heavens
Isa  But Ahaz said I will not put the Lord to the test by making such a request
Isa  And he said Give ear now O family of David is it not enough that you are driving men to disgust will you do the same to my God
Isa  For this cause the Lord himself will give you a sign a young woman is now with child and she will give birth to a son and she will give him the name Immanuel
Isa  Butter and honey will be his food when he is old enough to make a decision between evil and good
Isa  For before the child is old enough to make a decision between evil and good the land whose two kings you are now fearing will have become waste
Isa  The Lord is about to send on you and on your people and on your fathers house such a time of trouble as there has not been from the days of the separating of Ephraim from Judah even the coming of the king of Assyria
Isa  And it will be in that day that the Lord will make a piping sound for the fly which is in the end of the rivers of Egypt and for the bee which is in the land of Assyria
Isa  And they will come covering all the waste valleys and the holes of the rocks and the thorns and all the wateringplaces
Isa  In that day will the Lord take away the hair of the head and of the feet as well as the hair of the face with a blade got for a price from the other side of the River even with the king of Assyria
Isa  And it will be in that day that a man will give food to a young cow and two sheep
Isa  And they will give so much milk that he will be able to have butter for his food for butter and honey will be the food of all who are still living in the land
Isa  And it will be in that day that in every place where before there were a thousand vines valued at a thousand shekels of silver there will be nothing but blackberries and thorns
Isa  Men will come there with bows and arrows because all the land will be full of blackberries and thorns
Isa  And they will send out the oxen and the sheep on all the hills which before were worked with the spade  fear of blackberries and thorns
Isa  And the Lord said to me Take a great writingboard and on it put down in common letters Mahershalalhashbaz
Isa  And take true witnesses to the writing Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah
Isa  And I went in to my wife and she became with child and gave birth to a son Then the Lord said to me Give him the name Mahershalalhashbaz
Isa  For before the child is able to say Father or Mother the wealth of Damascus and the goods of Samaria will be taken away by the king of Assyria
Isa  And the Lord said again to me
Isa  Because this people will have nothing to do with the softlyflowing waters of Shiloah and have fear of Rezin and Remaliahs son
Isa  For this cause the Lord is sending on them the waters of the River deep and strong even the king of Assyria and all his glory and it will come up through all its streams overflowing all its edges
Isa  And it will come on into Judah rushing on and overflowing till the waters are up to the neck  and his outstretched wings will be covering the land from side to side for God is with us
Isa  Have knowledge O peoples and be in fear give ear all you faroff parts of the earth
Isa  Let your designs be formed and they will come to nothing give your orders and they will not be effected for God is with us
Isa  For the Lord controlling me with a strong hand gave me orders not to go in the way of this people saying
Isa  Do not say It is holy about everything of which this people says It is holy and do not be in fear of what they go in fear of
Isa  But let the Lord of armies be holy to you and go in fear of him giving honour to him
Isa  And he will be for a holy place but for a stone of falling and a rock of trouble to the two houses of Israel and to the men of Jerusalem for a net in which they may be taken
Isa  And numbers of them falling on the stone will be broken and will be taken in the net
Isa  Let my teaching be kept secret and my words be given to my disciples only
Isa  And I will be waiting for the Lord whose face is veiled from the house of Jacob and I will be looking for him
Isa  See I and the children whom the Lord has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the Lord of armies whose restingplace is in Mount Zion
Isa  And when they say to you Make request for us to those who have control of spirits and to those wise in secret arts who make hollow birdlike sounds is it not right for a people to make request to their gods to make request for the living to the dead
Isa  Then say to them Put your faith in the teaching and the witness  If they do not say such things  For him there is no dawn 
Isa  And he will go through the land in bitter trouble and in need of food and when he is unable to get food he will become angry cursing his king and his God and his eyes will be turned to heaven on high
Isa  And he will be looking down on the earth and there will be trouble and dark clouds black night where there is no seeing
Isa  In earlier times he made the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali of small value but after that he gave it glory by the way of the sea on the other side of Jordan Galilee of the nations
Isa  The people who went in the dark have seen a great light and for those who were living in the land of the deepest night the light is shining
Isa  You have made them very glad increasing their joy They are glad before you as men are glad in the time of getting in the grain or when they make division of the goods taken in war
Isa  For by your hand the yoke on his neck and the rod on his back even the rod of his cruel master have been broken as in the day of Midian
Isa  For every boot of the man of war with his sounding step and the clothing rolled in blood will be for burning food for the fire
Isa  For to us a child has come to us a son is given and the government has been placed in his hands and he has been named Wise Guide Strong God Father for ever Prince of Peace
Isa  Of the increase of his rule and of peace there will be no end on the seat of David and in his kingdom to make it strong supporting it with wise decision and righteousness now and for ever By the fixed purpose of the Lord of armies this will be done
Isa  The Lord has sent a word to Jacob and it has come on Israel
Isa  And all the people will have experience of it even Ephraim and the men of Samaria who say in the pride of their uplifted hearts
Isa  The bricks have come down but we will put up buildings of cut stone in their place the sycamores are cut down but they will be changed to cedars
Isa  For this cause the Lord has made strong the haters of Israel driving them on to make war against him
Isa  Aram on the east and the Philistines on the west who have come against Israel with open mouths For all this his wrath is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still
Isa  But the heart of the people was not turned to him who sent punishment on them and they made no prayer to the Lord of armies
Isa  For this cause the Lord took away from Israel head and tail high and low in one day
Isa  The man who is honoured and responsible is the head and the prophet who gives false teaching is the tail
Isa  For the guides of this people are the cause of their wandering from the right way and those who are guided by them come to destruction
Isa  For this cause the Lord will have no pleasure in their young men and no pity on their widows and the children without fathers for they are all haters of God and evildoers and foolish words come from every mouth For all this his wrath is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still
Isa  For evil was burning like a fire the blackberries and thorns were burned up the thick woods took fire rolling up in dark clouds of smoke
Isa  The land was dark with the wrath of the Lord of armies the people were like those who take mens flesh for food
Isa  On the right a man was cutting off bits and was still in need on the left a man took a meal but had not enough no man had pity on his brother every man was making a meal of the flesh of his neighbour
Isa  Manasseh was making a meal of Ephraim and Ephraim of Manasseh and together they were attacking Judah For all this his wrath is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still
Isa  Cursed are those who make evil decisions and the writers who make the records of their cruel acts
Isa  Who do wrong to the poor in their cause and take away the right of the crushed among my people so that they may have the property of widows and get under their power those who have no father
Isa  And what will you do in the day of punishment and in the destruction which is coming from far to whom will you go for help and what will become of your glory
Isa   For all this his wrath is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still
Isa  Ho Assyrian the rod of my wrath the instrument of my punishment
Isa  I will send him against a nation of wrongdoers and against the people of my wrath I will give him orders to take their wealth in war crushing them down like the dust in the streets
Isa  But this is not what is in his mind and this is not his design but his purpose is destruction and the cutting off of more and more nations
Isa  For he says Are not all my captains kings
Isa  Will not the fate of Calno be like that of Carchemish is not Hamath as Arpad is not Samaria as Damascus
Isa  As my hand has come on the kingdoms of the images whose pictured images were more in number than those of Jerusalem and Samaria
Isa  So as I have done to Samaria and her images I will do to Jerusalem and her images
Isa  For this cause it will be that when the purpose of the Lord against Mount Zion and Jerusalem is complete I will send punishment on the pride of the heart of the king of Assyria and on the glory of his uplifted eyes
Isa  For he has said By the strength of my hand I have done it and by my knowledge for I am wise and I have taken away the limits of the peoples lands and the stores of their wealth have become mine and I have made towns low in the dust sending destruction on those living in them
Isa  And I have put my hands on the wealth of the peoples as on the place where a bird has put her eggs and as a man may take the eggs from which a bird has gone so I have taken all the earth for myself and not a wing was moved and not a mouth gave out a sound
Isa  Will the axe say highsounding words against him who is using it or the blade be full of pride against him who is cutting with it As if a rod had the power of shaking him who is using it or as if a stick might take up him who is not wood
Isa  For this cause the Lord the Lord of armies will make his fat become wasted and in his inner parts a fire will be lighted like a burning flame
Isa  And the light of Israel will be for a fire and his Holy One for a flame wasting and burning up his thorns in one day
Isa  And he will put an end to the glory of his woods and of his planted fields soul and body together and it will be as when a man is wasted by disease
Isa  And the rest of the trees of his wood will be small in number so that a child may put them down in writing
Isa  And it will be in that day that the rest of Israel and those of Jacob who have come safely through these troubles will no longer go for help to him whose rod was on their back but their faith will be in the Lord the Holy One of Israel
Isa  The rest even the rest of Jacob will come back to the Strong God
Isa  For though your people O Israel are as the sand of the sea only a small number will come back for the destruction is fixed overflowing in righteousness
Isa  For the Lord the Lord of armies is about to make destruction complete in all the land
Isa  For this cause the Lord the Lord of armies says O my people living in Zion have no fear of the Assyrian even if his rod comes on your back and his stick is lifted up as in Egypt
Isa  For in a very short time my passion will be over and my wrath will be turned to their destruction
Isa  And the Lord of armies will be shaking a whip against him as when he overcame Midian at the rock of Oreb and his rod will be lifted up against them as it was against the Egyptians
Isa  And in that day the weight which he put on your back will be taken away and his yoke broken from off your neck
Isa  He has gone up from PeneRimmon he has come to Aiath he has gone past Migron at Michmash he puts his forces in order
Isa  They have gone across the mountain Geba will be our restingplace tonight they say Ramah is shaking with fear Gibeah of Saul has gone in flight
Isa  Give a loud cry daughter of Gallim let Laishah give ear let Anathoth give answer to her
Isa  Madmenah has gone the men of Gebim are putting their goods in a safe place
Isa  This very day he is stopping at Nob he is shaking his hand against the mountain of the daughter of Zion the hill of Jerusalem
Isa  See the Lord the Lord of armies is cutting off his branches with a great noise and his strong ones are falling and his high ones are coming down
Isa  And he is cutting down the thick places of the wood with an axe and Lebanon with its tall trees is coming down
Isa  And there will come a rod out of the broken tree of Jesse and a branch out of his roots will give fruit
Isa  And the spirit of the Lord will be resting on him the spirit of wisdom and good sense the spirit of wise guiding and strength the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord
Isa  And he will not be guided in his judging by what he sees or give decisions by the hearing of his ears
Isa  But he will do right in the cause of the poor and give wise decisions for those in the land who are in need and the rod of his mouth will come down on the cruel and with the breath of his lips he will put an end to the evildoer
Isa  And righteousness will be the cord of his robe and good faith the band round his breast
Isa  And the wolf will be living with the lamb and the leopard will take his rest with the young goat and the lion will take grass for food like the ox and the young lion will go with the young ones of the herd and a little child will be their guide
Isa  And the cow and the bear will be friends while their young ones are sleeping together
Isa  And the child at the breast will be playing by the hole of the snake and the older child will put his hand on the bright eye of the poisonsnake
Isa  There will be no cause of pain or destruction in all my holy mountain for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the sea is covered by the waters
Isa  And in that day the eyes of the nations will be turned to the root of Jesse which will be lifted up as the flag of the peoples and his restingplace will be glory
Isa  And in that day the hand of the Lord will be stretched out the second time to get back the rest of his people from Assyria and from Egypt and from Pathros and from Cush and from Elam and from Shinar and from Hamath and from the sealands
Isa  And he will put up a flag as a sign to the nations and he will get together those of Israel who had been sent away and the wandering ones of Judah from the four ends of the earth
Isa  And the envy of Ephraim will be gone and those who make trouble for Judah will come to an end Ephraim will have no more envy of Judah and there will be an end of Judahs hate for Ephraim
Isa  And they will be united in attacking the Philistines on the west and together they will take the goods of the children of the east their hand will be on Edom and Moab and the children of Ammon will be under their rule
Isa  And the Lord will make the tongue of the Egyptian sea completely dry and with his burning wind his hand will be stretched out over the River and it will be parted into seven streams so that men may go over it with dry feet
Isa  And there will be a highway for the rest of his people from Assyria as there was for Israel in the day when he came up out of the land of Egypt
Isa  And in that day you will say I will give praise to you O Lord for though you were angry with me your wrath is turned away and I am comforted
Isa  See God is my salvation I will have faith in the Lord without fear for the Lord Jah is my strength and song and he has become my salvation
Isa  So with joy will you get water out of the springs of salvation
Isa  And in that day you will say Give praise to the Lord let his name be honoured give word of his doings among the peoples say that his name is lifted up
Isa  Make a song to the Lord for he has done noble things give news of them through all the earth
Isa  Let your voice be sounding in a cry of joy O daughter of Zion for great is the Holy One of Israel among you
Isa  The word of the Lord about Babylon which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw
Isa  Put up a flag on a clear mountaintop make a loud outcry to them give directions with the hand so that they may go into the doors of the great ones
Isa  I have given orders to my holy ones I have sent out my men of war those of mine who take pride in their power to give effect to my wrath
Isa  The noise of great numbers in the mountains like the noise of a strong people The noise of the kingdoms of the nations meeting together The Lord of armies is numbering his forces for war
Isa  They come from a far country from the farthest part of heaven even the Lord and the instruments of his wrath with destruction for all the land
Isa  Send out a cry of grief for the day of the Lord is near it comes as destruction from the Most High
Isa  For this cause all hands will be feeble and every heart of man be turned to water
Isa  Their hearts will be full of fear pains and sorrows will overcome them they will be in pain like a woman in childbirth they will be shocked at one another their faces will be like flames
Isa  See the day of the Lord is coming cruel with wrath and burning passion to make the land a waste driving the sinners in it to destruction
Isa  For the stars of heaven and its bright armies will not give their light the sun will be made dark in his journey through the heaven and the moon will keep back her light
Isa  And I will send punishment on the world for its evil and on the sinners for their wrongdoing and I will put an end to all pride and will make low the power of the cruel
Isa  I will make men so small in number that a man will be harder to get than gold even the best gold of Ophir
Isa  For this cause the heavens will be shaking and the earth will be moved out of its place in the wrath of the Lord of armies and in the day of his burning passion
Isa  And it will be that like a roe in flight and like wandering sheep they will go every man to his people and to his land
Isa  Everyone who is overtaken will have a spear put through him and everyone who goes in flight will be put to the sword
Isa  Their young children will be broken up before their eyes their goods will be taken away and their wives made the property of others
Isa  See I am driving the Medes against them who put no value on silver and have no pleasure in gold
Isa  In their hands are bows and spears they are cruel violently putting the young men to death and crushing the young women they have no pity for children and no mercy for the fruit of the body
Isa  And Babylon the glory of kingdoms the beautiful town which is the pride of the Chaldaeans will be like Gods destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah
Isa  People will never be living in it again and it will have no more men from generation to generation the Arab will not put up his tent there and those who keep sheep will not make it a restingplace for their flocks
Isa  But the beasts of the waste land will have their holes there and the houses will be full of crying jackals and ostriches will have their place there and evil spirits will be dancing there
Isa  And wolves will be answering one another in their towers and jackals in their houses of pleasure her time is near and her days of power will quickly be ended
Isa  For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob and will again make Israel his special people and will put them in their land and the man from a strange country will take his place among them and be joined to the family of Jacob
Isa  And the people will take them with them to their place and the children of Israel will give them a heritage in the Lords land as menservants and womenservants making them prisoners whose prisoners they were and they will be rulers over their masters
Isa  And it will be in the day when the Lord gives you rest from your sorrow and from your trouble and from the hard yoke which they had put on you
Isa  That you will take up this bitter song against the king of Babylon and say How has the cruel overseer come to an end He who was lifted up in pride is cut off
Isa  The stick of the evildoers the rod of the rulers is broken by the Lord
Isa  He whose rod was on the peoples with an unending wrath ruling the nations in passion with an uncontrolled rule

Isa  They all make answer and say to you Have you become feeble like us have you been made even as we are
Isa  Your pride has gone down into the underworld and the noise of your instruments of music the worms are under you and your body is covered with them
Isa  How great is your fall from heaven O shining one son of the morning How are you cut down to the earth low among the dead bodies
Isa  For you said in your heart I will go up to heaven I will make my seat higher than the stars of God I will take my place on the mountain of the meetingplace of the gods in the inmost parts of the north
Isa  I will go higher than the clouds I will be like the Most High
Isa  But you will come down to the underworld even to its inmost parts
Isa  Those who see you will be looking on you with care they will be in deep thought saying Is this the troubler of the earth the shaker of kingdoms
Isa  Who made the world a waste overturning its towns who did not let his prisoners loose from the prisonhouse
Isa  All the kings of the earth are at rest in glory every man in his house
Isa  But you like a birth before its time are stretched out with no restingplace in the earth clothed with the bodies of the dead who have been put to the sword who go down to the lowest parts of the underworld a dead body crushed under foot
Isa  As for your fathers you will not be united with them in their restingplace because you have been the cause of destruction to your land and of death to your people the seed of the evildoer will have no place in the memory of man
Isa  Make ready a place of death for his children because of the evildoing of their father so that they may not come up and take the earth for their heritage covering the face of the world with waste places
Isa  For I will come up against them says the Lord of armies cutting off from Babylon name and offspring son and sons son says the Lord

Isa  The chiefs of Zoan have become foolish the chiefs of Noph are tricked the heads of her tribes are the cause of Egypts wandering out of the way
Isa  The Lord has sent among them a spirit of error and by them Egypt is turned out of the right way in all her doings as a man overcome by wine is uncertain in his steps

Isa  In that day Israel will be the third together with Egypt and Assyria a blessing in the earth
Isa  Because of the blessing of the Lord of armies which he has given them saying A blessing on Egypt my people and on Assyria the work of my hands and on Israel my heritage
Isa  In the year when the Tartan came to Ashdod sent by Sargon king of Assyria and made war against it and took it
Isa  At that time the word of the Lord came to Isaiah the son of Amoz saying Go and take off your robe and your shoes from your feet and he did so walking unclothed and without shoes on his feet
Isa  And the Lord said As my servant Isaiah has gone unclothed and without shoes for three years as a sign and a wonder to Egypt and Ethiopia
Isa  So will the king of Assyria take away the prisoners of Egypt and those forced out of Ethiopia young and old unclothed and without shoes and with backs uncovered to the shame of Egypt
Isa  And they will be full of fear and will no longer have faith in Ethiopia which was their hope or in Egypt which was their glory

Isa  For it is a day of trouble and of crushing down and of destruction from the Lord the Lord of armies in the valley of vision 
Isa  And Elam was armed with arrows and Aram came on horseback and the breastplate of Kir was uncovered
Isa  And your most fertile valleys were full of warcarriages and the horsemen took up their positions in front of the town
Isa  He took away the cover of Judah and in that day you were looking with care at the store of arms in the house of the woods
Isa  And you saw all the broken places in the wall of the town of David and you got together the waters of the lower pool
Isa  And you had the houses of Jerusalem numbered pulling down the houses to make the wall stronger
Isa  And you made a place between the two walls for storing the waters of the old pool but you gave no thought to him who had done this and were not looking to him by whom it had been purposed long before
Isa  And in that day the Lord the Lord of armies was looking for weeping and cries of sorrow cutting off of the hair and putting on the clothing of grief
Isa  But in place of these there was joy and delight oxen and sheep were being made ready for food there was feasting and drinking men said Now is the time for food and wine for tomorrow death comes

Isa  And I will give the key of the family of David into his care and what he keeps open will be shut by no one and what he keeps shut no one will make open
Isa  And I will put him like a nail in a safe place and he will be for a seat of glory to his fathers family
Isa  And all the glory of his fathers family will be hanging on him all their offspring every small vessel even the cups and the basins

Isa  Let your land be worked with the plough O daughter of Tarshish there is no longer any harbour
Isa  His hand is stretched out over the sea the kingdoms are shaking the Lord has given orders about Canaan to make waste its strong places
Isa  And he said There is no more joy for you O crushed virgin daughter of Zidon up go over to Kittim even there you will have no rest
Isa  
Isa  Let a cry of sorrow go up O ships of Tarshish because your strong place is made waste
Isa  And it will be in that day that Tyre will go out of mind for seventy years that is the days of one king after the end of seventy years it will be for Tyre as in the song of the loose woman
Isa  Take an instrument of music go about the town O loose woman who has gone out from the memory of man make sweet melody with songs so that you may come back to mens minds
Isa  And it will be after the end of seventy years that the Lord will have mercy on Tyre and she will go back to her trade acting as a loose woman with all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth
Isa  And her goods and her trade will be holy to the Lord they will not be kept back or stored up for her produce will be for those living in the Lords land to give them food for their needs and fair clothing
Isa  See the Lord is making the earth waste and unpeopled he is turning it upside down and sending the people in all directions
Isa  And it will be the same for the people as for the priest for the servant as for his master and for the womanservant as for her owner the same for the one offering goods for a price as for him who takes them the same for him who gives money at interest and for him who takes it the same for him who lets others have the use of his property as for those who make use of it
Isa  The earth will be completely waste and without men for this is the word of the Lord
Isa  The earth is sorrowing and wasting away the world is full of grief and wasting away the high ones of the earth come to nothing
Isa  The earth has been made unclean by those living in it because the laws have not been kept by them the orders have been changed and the eternal agreement has been broken
Isa  For this cause the earth is given up to the curse and those in it are judged as sinners for this cause those living on the earth are burned up and the rest are small in number
Isa  The new wine is thin the vine is feeble and all the gladhearted make sounds of grief
Isa  The pleasing sound of all instruments of music has come to an end and the voices of those who are glad
Isa  There is no more drinking of wine with a song strong drink will be bitter to those who take it
Isa  The town is waste and broken down every house is shut up so that no man may come in
Isa  There is a crying in the streets because of the wine there is an end of all delight the joy of the land is gone
Isa  In the town all is waste and in the public place is destruction
Isa  For it will be in the heart of the earth among the peoples like the shaking of an olivetree as the last of the grapes after the gettingin is done
Isa  But those will be making sounds of joy they will be crying loudly from the sea for the glory of the Lord
Isa  Give praise to the Lord in the east to the name of the Lord the God of Israel in the sealands
Isa  From the farthest part of the earth comes the sound of songs glory to the upright But I said I am wasting away wasting away the curse is on me The false ones go on in their false way yes they go on acting falsely
Isa  Fear and death and the net are come on you O people of the earth
Isa  And it will be that he who goes in flight from the sound of fear will be overtaken by death and he who gets free from death will be taken in the net for the windows on high are open and the bases of the earth are shaking
Isa  The earth is completely broken it is parted in two it is violently moved
Isa  The earth will be moving uncertainly like a man overcome by drink it will be shaking like a tent and the weight of its sin will be on it crushing it down so that it will not get up again
Isa  And in that day the Lord will send punishment on the army of the high ones on high and on the kings of the earth on the earth
Isa  And they will be got together like prisoners in the prisonhouse and after a long time they will have their punishment
Isa  Then the moon will be veiled and the sun put to shame for the Lord of armies will be ruling in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem and before his judges he will let his glory be seen
Isa  O Lord you are my God I will give praise to you I will give honour to your name for you have done great acts of power your purposes in the past have been made true and certain in effect
Isa  For you have made a town a waste place a strong town a mass of broken walls the tower of the men of pride has come to an end it will never be put up again
Isa  For this cause will the strong people give glory to you the town of the cruel ones will be in fear of you
Isa  For you have been a strong place for the poor and the crushed in their trouble a safe place from the storm a shade from the heat when the wrath of the cruel ones is like a winter storm
Isa  As heat by the shade of a cloud the noise of the men of pride has been made quiet by you as heat by the shade of a cloud the song of the cruel ones has been stopped
Isa  And in this mountain will the Lord of armies make for all peoples a feast of good things a feast of wines long stored of good things sweet to the taste of wines long kept and tested
Isa  And in this mountain he will put an end to the shade covering the face of all peoples and the veil which is stretched over all nations
Isa  He has put an end to death for ever and the Lord God will take away all weeping and he will put an end to the shame of his people in all the earth for the Lord has said it
Isa  And in that day it will be said See this is our God we have been waiting for him and he will be our saviour this is the Lord in whom is our hope we will be glad and have delight in his salvation
Isa  For in this mountain will the hand of the Lord come to rest and Moab will be crushed down in his place even as the dry stems of the grain are crushed under foot in the waste place
Isa  And if he puts out his hands like a man stretching out his hands in swimming the Lord will make low his pride however expert his designs
Isa  And the strong tower of your walls has been broken by him made low and crushed even to the dust
Isa  In that day will this song be made in the land of Judah We have a strong town he will make salvation our walls and towers
Isa  Let the doors be open so that the upright nation which keeps faith may come in
Isa  The man whose heart is unmoved you will keep in peace because his hope is in you
Isa  Let your hope be in the Lord for ever for the Lord Jah is an unchanging Rock
Isa  For he has made low those who are lifted up all the people of the town of pride he makes it low crushing it down to the earth he makes it low in the dust
Isa  It will be crushed under the feet of the poor and the steps of those who are in need
Isa  The way of the good man is straight the road of the upright is made smooth by you
Isa  We have been waiting for you O Lord the desire of our soul is for the memory of your name
Isa  In the night the desire of my soul has been for you early will my spirit be searching for you for when your punishments come on the earth the people of the world will get the knowledge of righteousness
Isa  Even if you are kind to the evildoer he will not go after righteousness even in the land of the upright he will still go on in his wrongdoing and will not see the glory of the Lord
Isa  Lord your hand is lifted up but they do not see let them see  yes your haters will be burned up in the fire
Isa  Lord you will give us peace for all our works are the outcome of your purpose
Isa  O Lord our God other lords than you have had rule over us but in you only is our salvation and no other name will we take on our lips
Isa  The dead will not come back to life their spirits will not come back to earth for this cause you have sent destruction on them so that the memory of them is dead
Isa  You have made the nation great O Lord you have made it great glory is yours you have made wide the limits of the land
Isa  Lord in trouble our eyes have been turned to you we sent up a prayer when your punishment was on us
Isa  As a woman with child whose time is near is troubled crying out in her pain so have we been before you O Lord
Isa  We have been with child we have been in pain we have given birth to wind no salvation has come to the earth through us and no children have come into the world
Isa  Your dead will come back their dead bodies will come to life again Those in the dust awaking from their sleep will send out a song for your dew is a dew of light and the earth will give birth to the shades
Isa  Come my people into your secret places and let your doors be shut keep yourself safe for a short time till his wrath is over
Isa  For the Lord is coming out of his place to send punishment on the people of the earth for their evildoing the earth will let the blood drained out on her be seen and will keep her dead covered no longer
Isa  In that day the Lord with his great and strong and cruel sword will send punishment on Leviathan the quickmoving snake and on Leviathan the twisted snake and he will put to death the dragon which is in the sea
Isa  In that day it will be said A vinegarden of delight make a song about it
Isa  I the Lord am watching it I will give it water at all times I will keep it night and day for fear that any damage comes to it
Isa  My passion is over if the thorns were fighting against me I would make an attack on them and they would be burned up together
Isa  Or let him put himself under my power and make peace with me
Isa  In days to come Jacob will take root Israel will put out buds and flowers and the face of the world will be full of fruit
Isa  Is his punishment like the punishment of those who overcame him or are his dead as great in number as those he put to the sword
Isa  Your anger against her has been made clear by driving her away he has taken her away with his stormwind in the day of his east wind
Isa  So by this will the sin of Jacob be covered and this is all the fruit of taking away his punishment when all the stones of the altar are crushed together so that the wood pillars and the sunimages will not be put up again
Isa  For the strong town is without men an unpeopled livingplace and she has become a waste land there the young ox will take his rest and its branches will be food for him
Isa  When its branches are dry they will be broken off the women will come and put fire to them for it is a foolish people for this cause he who made them will have no mercy on them and he whose work they are will not have pity on them
Isa  And it will be in that day that the Lord will get together his grain from the River to the stream of Egypt and you will be got together with care O children of Israel
Isa  And it will be in that day that a great horn will be sounded and those who were wandering in the land of Assyria and those who had been sent away into the land of Egypt will come and they will give worship to the Lord in the holy mountain at Jerusalem
Isa  Ho crown of pride of those who are given up to wine in Ephraim and the dead flower of his glory which is on the head of those who are overcome by strong drink
Isa  See the Lord has a strong and cruel one like a rain of ice a storm of destruction like the overflowing of a strong river he will violently overcome them
Isa  The crown of pride of those who are given up to wine in Ephraim will be crushed under foot
Isa  And the dead flower of his glory which is on the head of the fertile valley will be like the first early fruit before the summer which a man takes and puts in his mouth the minute he sees it
Isa  In that day will the Lord of armies be a crown of glory and a fair ornament to the rest of his people
Isa  And a spirit of wisdom to the judge and strength to those who keep back the attackers at the door of the town
Isa  And further these are uncertain through wine and have gone out of the right way through strong drink the priest and the prophet are uncertain through strong drink they are overcome by wine they have gone out of the way through strong drink their vision is false they go wrong in their decisions
Isa  For all the tables are covered with coughedup food so that there is not a clean place
Isa  To whom will he give knowledge and to whom will he make clear the word Will it be to those who have newly given up milk and who have only now been taken from the breast
Isa  For it is one rule after another one line after another here a little there a little
Isa  No but with broken talk and with a strange tongue he will give his word to this people
Isa  To whom he said This is the rest give rest to him who is tired and by this you may get new strength but they would not give ear
Isa  For this cause the word of the Lord will be to them rule after rule line after line here a little there a little so that they may go on their way and falling back may be broken and taken in the net
Isa  Give ear then to the word of the Lord you men of pride the rulers of this people in Jerusalem
Isa  Because you have said We have made death our friend and with the underworld we have made an agreement when the overflowing waters come through they will not come near us for we are looking to false words for help taking cover in what is untrue
Isa  For this cause says the Lord God See I am placing in Zion as a base a stone a tested stone an anglestone which is certain and of great value and he who has faith will not give way
Isa  And I will make right decision the measuringline and righteousness the weight and the icestorm will take away the safe place of false words and the secret place will be covered by the flowing waters
Isa  And the help you were looking for from death will come to nothing and your agreement with the underworld will be broken when the overflowing waters come through then you will be overcome by them
Isa  Whenever they come through they will overtake you for they will come through morning after morning by day and by night and the news will be nothing but fear
Isa  For the bed is not long enough for a man to be stretched out on and the cover is not wide enough for him to be covered with
Isa  For the Lord will come up as on Mount Perazim he will be moved to wrath as in the valley of Gibeon so that he may do his workstrange is his work and give effect to his actunnatural is his act
Isa  And now take care that you do not make sport of him or your bands will be made strong for I have had word from the Lord the Lord of armies of an end of a complete end which is to come on all the land
Isa  Let your ears be open to my voice give attention to what I say
Isa  Is the ploughman for ever ploughing does he not get the earth ready and broken up for the seed
Isa  When the face of the earth has been levelled does he not put in the different sorts of seed and the grain in lines and the barley in its place and the spelt at the edge
Isa  For his God is his teacher giving him the knowledge of these things
Isa  For the fitches are not crushed with a sharp instrument and a cartwheel is not rolled over the cummin but the grain of the fitches is hammered out with a stick and of the cummin with a rod
Isa  Is the grain for bread crushed He does not go on crushing it for ever but he lets his cartwheels and his horses go over it without crushing it
Isa  This comes from the Lord of armies purposing wonders and wise in all his acts
Isa  Ho Ariel Ariel the town against which David made war put year to year let the feasts come round
Isa  And I will send trouble on Ariel and there will be weeping and cries of grief and she will be to me as Ariel
Isa  And I will make war on you like David and you will be shut in by earthworks and I will make towers round you
Isa  And you will be made low and your voice will come out of the earth and your words will be low out of the dust and your voice will come out of the earth like that of a spirit making birdlike noises out of the dust
Isa  And the army of your attackers will be like small dust and all the cruel ones like dry stems gone before the wind suddenly it will come about
Isa  The Lord of armies will come in with thunder and earthshaking and great noise with rushing wind and storm and the flame of burning fire
Isa  And all the nations making war on Ariel and all those who are fighting against her and shutting her in with their towers will be like a dream like a vision of the night
Isa  And it will be like a man desiring food and dreaming that he is feasting but when he is awake there is nothing in his mouth or like a man in need of water dreaming that he is drinking but when he is awake he is feeble and his soul is full of desire so will all the nations be which make war on Mount Zion
Isa  Be surprised and full of wonder let your eyes be covered and be blind be overcome but not with wine go with uncertain steps but not because of strong drink
Isa  For the Lord has sent on you a spirit of deep sleep and by him your eyes the prophets are shut and your heads the seers are covered
Isa  And the vision of all this has become to you like the words of a book which is shut which men give to one who has knowledge of writing saying Make clear to us what is in the book and he says I am not able to for the book is shut
Isa  And they give it to one without learning saying Make clear to us what is in the book and he says I have no knowledge of writing
Isa  And the Lord said because this people come near to me with their mouths and give honour to me with their lips but their heart is far from me and their fear of me is false a rule given them by the teaching of men
Isa  For this cause I will again do a strange thing among this people a thing to be wondered at and the wisdom of their wise men will come to nothing and the sense of their guides will no longer be seen
Isa  Cursed are those who go deep to keep their designs secret from the Lord and whose works are in the dark and who say Who sees us and who has knowledge of our acts
Isa  You are turning things upside down Is the wet earth the same to you as the one who is forming it will the thing made say of him who made it He made me not or the thing formed say of him who gave it form He has no knowledge
Isa  In a very short time Lebanon will become a fertile field and the fertile field will seem like a wood
Isa  And in that day those whose ears are stopped will be hearing the words of the book and the eyes of the blind will see through the mist and the dark
Isa  And the poor will have their joy in the Lord increased and those in need will be glad in the Holy One of Israel
Isa  For the cruel one has come to nothing and those who make sport of the Lord are gone and those who are watching to do evil are cut off
Isa  Who give help to a man in a wrong cause and who put a net for the feet of him who gives decisions in the public place taking away a mans right without cause
Isa  For this reason the Lord the saviour of Abraham says about the family of Jacob Jacob will not now be put to shame or his face be clouded with fear
Isa  But when they the children of Jacob see the work of my hands among them they will give honour to my name yes they will give honour to the Holy One of Jacob and go in fear of the God of Israel
Isa  Those whose hearts were turned away from him will get knowledge and those who made an outcry against him will give attention to his teaching
Isa  Ho uncontrolled children says the Lord who give effect to a purpose which is not mine and who make an agreement but not by my spirit increasing their sin
Isa  Who make a move to go down into Egypt without authority from me who are looking to the strength of Pharaoh for help and whose hope is in the shade of Egypt
Isa  And the strength of Pharaoh will be your shame and your hope in the shade of Egypt will come to nothing
Isa  For his chiefs are at Zoan and his representatives have come to Hanes
Isa  For they have all come with offerings to a people of no use to them in whom is no help or profit but only shame and a bad name
Isa  The word about the Beasts of the South Through the land of trouble and grief the land of the shelion and the voice of the lion of the snake and the burning winged snake they take their wealth on the backs of young asses and their stores on camels to a people in whom is no profit
Isa  For there is no use or purpose in the help of Egypt so I have said about her She is Rahab who has come to an end
Isa  Now go put it in writing before them on a board and make a record of it in a book so that it may be for the future a witness for all time to come
Isa  For they are an uncontrolled people falsehearted who will not give ear to the teaching of the Lord
Isa  Who say to the seers See not and to the prophets Do not give us word of what is true but say false things to give us pleasure
Isa  Get out of the good way turning from the right road do not keep the Holy One of Israel before our minds
Isa  For this cause the Holy One of Israel says Because you will not give ear to this word and are looking for help in ways of deceit and evil and are putting your hope in them
Isa  This sin will be to you like a crack in a high wall causing its fall suddenly and in a minute
Isa  And he will let it be broken as a potters vessel is broken it will be smashed to bits without mercy so that there will not be a bit in which one may take fire from the fireplace or water from the spring
Isa  For the Lord the Holy One of Israel said In quiet and rest is your salvation peace and hope are your strength but you would not have it so
Isa  Saying No for we will go in flight on horses so you will certainly go in flight and We will go on the backs of quickrunning beasts so those who go after you will be quickfooted
Isa  A thousand will go in fear before one even before five you will go in flight till you are like a pillar by itself on the top of a mountain and like a flag on a hill
Isa  For this cause the Lord will be waiting so that he may be kind to you and he will be lifted up so that he may have mercy on you for the Lord is a God of righteousness there is a blessing on all whose hope is in him
Isa  O people living in Zion at Jerusalem your weeping will be ended he will certainly have mercy on you at the sound of your cry when it comes to his ear he will give you an answer
Isa  And though the Lord will give you the bread of trouble and the water of grief you will no longer put your teacher on one side but you will see your teacher
Isa  And at your back when you are turning to the right hand or to the left a voice will be sounding in your ears saying This is the way in which you are to go
Isa  And you will make unclean what is covering your pictured images of silver and the plating of your images of gold you will send them away as an unclean thing saying Be gone
Isa  And he will give rain for your seed so that you may put it in the earth and you will have bread from the produce of the earth good and more than enough for your needs in that day the cattle will get their food in wide grasslands
Isa  And the oxen and the young asses which are used for ploughing will have salted grain which has been made free from the waste with fork and basket
Isa  And there will be rivers and streams of water on every tall mountain and on every high hill in the day when great numbers are put to the sword when the towers come down
Isa  And the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun and the light of the sun will be seven times greater as the light of seven days in the day when the Lord puts oil on the wounds of his people and makes them well from the blows they have undergone
Isa  See the name of the Lord is coming from far burning with his wrath with thick smoke going up his lips are full of passion and his tongue is like a burning fire
Isa  And his breath is as an overflowing stream coming up even to the neck shaking the nations for their destruction like the shaking of grain in a basket and he will put a cord in the mouths of the people turning them out of their way
Isa  You will have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept and you will be glad in heart as when they go with music of the pipe to the mountain of the Lord the Rock of Israel
Isa  And the Lord will send out the sound of his great voice and they will see his arm stretched out with the heat of his wrath and the flame of a burning fire with a cloudburst and storm and a rain of ice
Isa  For through the voice of the Lord the Assyrian will be broken and the Lords rod will be lifted up against him
Isa  And every blow of the rod of his punishment which the Lord will send on him will be with the sound of music and with the waving of his sword the Lord will make war against him
Isa  For a place of fire has long been ready yes it has been made ready for the king he has made it deep and wide it is massed with fire and much wood the breath of the Lord like a stream of fire puts a light to it
Isa  Cursed are those who go down to Egypt for help and who put their faith in horses looking to warcarriages for salvation because of their numbers and to horsemen because they are very strong but they are not looking to the Holy One of Israel or turning their hearts to the Lord
Isa  Though he is wise and able to send evil and his purpose will not be changed but he will go against the house of the evildoers and against those to whom they are looking for help
Isa  For the Egyptians are men and not God and their horses are flesh and not spirit and when the Lords hand is stretched out the helper and he who is helped will come down together
Isa  For the Lord has said to me As a lion or a young lion makes an angry noise over his food and if a band of herdsmen come out against him he will not be in fear of their voices or give up his food for their noise so the Lord of armies will come down to make war against Mount Zion and its hill
Isa  Like birds with outstretched wings so will the Lord of armies be a cover to Jerusalem he will be a cover and salvation for it going over it he will keep it from danger
Isa  Come back to him who has been so deeply sinned against by the children of Israel
Isa  For in that day they will all give up their images of silver and of gold the sin which they made for themselves
Isa  Then the Assyrian will come down by the sword but not of man the sword not of men will be the cause of his destruction and he will go in flight from the sword and his young men will be put to forced work
Isa  And his rock will come to nothing because of fear and his chiefs will go in flight from the flag says the Lord whose fire is in Zion and his altar in Jerusalem
Isa  See a king will be ruling in righteousness and chiefs will give right decisions
Isa  And a man will be as a safe place from the wind and a cover from the storm as rivers of water in a dry place as the shade of a great rock in a waste land
Isa  And the eyes of those who see will not be shut and those who have hearing will give ear to the word
Isa  The man of sudden impulses will become wise in heart and he whose tongue is slow will get the power of talking clearly
Isa  The foolish man will no longer be named noble and they will not say of the false man that he is a man of honour
Isa  For the foolish man will say foolish things having evil thoughts in his heart working what is unclean and talking falsely about the Lord to keep food from him who is in need of it and water from him whose soul is desiring it
Isa  The designs of the false are evil purposing the destruction of the poor man by false words even when he is in the right
Isa  But the noblehearted man has noble purposes and by these he will be guided
Isa  Give ear to my voice you women who are living in comfort give attention to my words you daughters who have no fear of danger
Isa  In not much more than a year you who are not looking for evil will be troubled for the produce of the vinegardens will be cut off and there will be no getting in of the grapes
Isa  Be shaking with fear you women who are living in comfort be troubled you who have no fear of danger take off your robes and put on clothing of grief
Isa  Have sorrow for the fields the pleasing fields the fertile vine
Isa  And for the land of my people where thorns will come up even for all the houses of joy in the glad town
Isa  For the fair houses will have no man living in them the town which was full of noise will become a waste the hill and the watchtower will be unpeopled for ever a joy for the asses of the woods a place of food for the flocks
Isa  Till the spirit comes on us from on high and the waste land becomes a fertile field and the fertile field is changed into a wood
Isa  Then in the waste land there will be an upright rule and righteousness will have its place in the fertile field
Isa  And the work of righteousness will be peace and the effect of an upright rule will be to take away fear for ever
Isa  And my people will be living in peace in houses where there is no fear and in quiet restingplaces
Isa  But the tall trees will come down with a great fall and the town will be low in a low place
Isa  Happy are you who are planting seed by all the waters and sending out the ox and the ass
Isa  Ho you who make waste those who did not make you waste acting falsely to those who were not false to you When you have come to an end of wasting you will be made waste and after your false acts they will do the same to you
Isa  O Lord have mercy on us for we have been waiting for your help be our strength every morning our salvation in time of trouble
Isa  At the loud noise the peoples have gone in flight at your coming up the nations have gone in all directions
Isa  And the goods taken in war will be got together like the massing of young locusts men will be rushing on them like the rushing of locusts
Isa  The Lord is lifted up his place is on high he has made Zion full of righteousness and true religion
Isa  And she will have no more fear of change being full of salvation wisdom and knowledge the fear of the Lord is her wealth
Isa  See the men of war are sorrowing outside the town those who came looking for peace are weeping bitterly
Isa  The highways are waste no man is journeying there the agreement is broken he has made sport of the towns he has no thought for man
Isa  The earth is sorrowing and wasting away Lebanon is put to shame and has become waste Sharon is like the Arabah and in Bashan and Carmel the leaves are falling
Isa  Now will I come forward says the Lord now will I be lifted up now will my power be seen
Isa  Your designs will be without profit and their effect will be nothing you will be burned up by the fire of my breath
Isa  And the peoples will be like the burning of chalk as thorns cut down which are burned in the fire
Isa  Give ear you who are far off to what I have done see my power you who are near
Isa  The sinners in Zion are full of fear the haters of God are shaking with wonder Who among us may keep his place before the burning fire who among us may see the eternal burnings
Isa  He whose ways are true and whose words are upright he who gives no thought to the profits of false acts whose hands have not taken rewards who will have no part in putting men to death and whose eyes are shut against evil
Isa  He will have a place on high he will be safely shut in by the high rocks his bread will be given to him his waters will be certain
Isa  Your eyes will see the king in his glory they will be looking on a farstretching land
Isa  Your heart will give thought to the cause of your fear where is the scribe where is he who made a record of the payments where is he by whom the towers were numbered
Isa  Never again will you see the cruel people a people whose tongue has no sense for you whose language is strange to you
Isa  Let your eyes be resting on Zion the town of our holy feasts you will see Jerusalem a quiet restingplace a tent which will not be moved whose tentpins will never be pulled up and whose cords will never be broken
Isa  But there the Lord will be with us in his glory  wide rivers and streams where no boat will go with blades and no fair ship will be sailing
Isa  For the Lord is our judge the Lord is our lawgiver the Lord is our king he will be our saviour
Isa  Your cords have become loose they were not able to make strong the support of their sails the sail was not stretched out then the blind will take much property the feeblefooted will make division of the goods of war
Isa  And the men of Zion will not say I am ill for its people will have forgiveness for their sin
Isa  Come near you nations and give ear take note you peoples let the earth and everything in it give ear the world and all those living in it
Isa  For the Lord is angry with all the nations and his wrath is burning against all their armies he has put them to the curse he has given them to destruction
Isa  Their dead bodies will be thick on the face of the earth and their smell will come up and the mountains will be flowing with their blood and all the hills will come to nothing
Isa  And the heavens will be rolled together like the roll of a book and all their army will be gone like a dead leaf from the vine or a dry fruit from the figtree
Isa  For my sword in heaven is full of wrath see it is coming down on Edom in punishment on the people of my curse
Isa  The sword of the Lord is full of blood it is fat with the best of the meat with the blood of lambs and goats with the best parts of the sheep for the Lord has a feast in Bozrah and much cattle will be put to death in the land of Edom
Isa  And the strong oxen will go down to death together with the smaller cattle
Isa  For it is the day of the Lords punishment when he gives payment for the wrongs done to Zion
Isa  And its streams will be turned into boiling oil and its dust into burning stone and all the land will be on fire
Isa  It will not be put out day or night its smoke will go up for ever it will be waste from generation to generation no one will go through it for ever
Isa  But the birds of the waste land will have their place there it will be a heritage for the bittern and the raven and it will be measured out with line and weight as a waste land
Isa  The jackals will be there and her great ones will be gone they will say There is no longer a kingdom there and all her chiefs will have come to an end
Isa  And thorns will come up in her fair houses and waste plants in her strong towers and foxes will make their holes there and it will be a meetingplace for ostriches
Isa  And the beasts of the waste places will come together with the jackals and the evil spirits will be crying to one another even the nightspirit will come and make her restingplace there
Isa  The arrowsnake will make her hole and put her eggs there and get her young together under her shade there the hawks will come together by twos
Isa  See what is recorded in the book of the Lord all these will be there not one without the other the mouth of the Lord has given the order and his spirit has made them come together
Isa  And he has given them their heritage and by his hand it has been measured out to them it will be theirs for ever their restingplace from generation to generation
Isa  The waste land and the dry places will be glad the lowland will have joy and be full of flowers
Isa  It will be flowering like the rose it will be full of delight and songs the glory of Lebanon will be given to it the pride of Carmel and Sharon they will see the glory of the Lord the power of our God
Isa  Make strong the feeble hands give support to the shaking knees
Isa  Say to those who are full of fear Be strong and take heart see your God will give punishment the reward of God will come he himself will come to be your saviour
Isa  Then the eyes of the blind will see and the ears which are stopped will be open
Isa  Then will the feeblefooted be jumping like a roe and the voice which was stopped will be loud in song for in the waste land streams will be bursting out and waters in the dry places
Isa  And the burning sand will become a pool and the dry earth springs of waters the fields where the sheep take their food will become wet land and waterplants will take the place of grass
Isa  And a highway will be there its name will be The Holy Way the unclean and the sinner may not go over it and those who go on it will not be turned out of the way by the foolish
Isa  No lion will be there or any cruel beast they will not be seen there but those for whom the Lord has given a price
Isa  Even those whom he has made free will come back again they will come with songs to Zion on their heads will be eternal joy delight and joy will be theirs and sorrow and sounds of grief will be gone for ever
Isa  And it came about in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the walled towns of Judah and took them
Isa  And the king of Assyria sent the Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah with a strong force and he took up his position by the stream of the higher pool by the highway of the washermans
Isa  And there came out to him Eliakim the son of Hilkiah who was over the house and Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder
Isa  And the Rabshakeh said to them Say now to Hezekiah These are the words of the great king the king of Assyria In what are you placing your hope
Isa  You say you have a design and strength for war but these are only words now to whom are you looking for support that you have gone against my authority
Isa  See you are basing your hope on that broken rod of Egypt which will go into a mans hand if he makes use of it for a support for so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who put their faith in him
Isa  And if you say to me Our hope is in the Lord our God is it not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah has taken away saying to Judah and Jerusalem that worship may only be given before this altar
Isa  And now take a chance with my master the king of Assyria and I will give you two thousand horses if you are able to put horsemen on them
Isa  How then may you put to shame the least of my masters servants and you have put your hope in Egypt for warcarriages and horsemen
Isa  And have I now come to send destruction on this land without the Lords authority It was the Lord himself who said to me Go up against this land and make it waste
Isa  Then Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to the Rabshakeh Please make use of the Aramaean language in talking to your servants for we are used to it and do not make use of the Jews language in the hearing of the people on the wall
Isa  But the Rabshakeh said Is it to your master or to you that my master has sent me to say these words has he not sent me to the men seated on the wall for they are the people who will be short of food with you when the town is shut in
Isa  Then the Rabshakeh got up and said with a loud voice in the Jews language Give ear to the words of the great king the king of Assyria
Isa  This is what the king says Do not be tricked by Hezekiah for there is no salvation for you in him
Isa  And do not let Hezekiah make you put your faith in the Lord saying The Lord will certainly keep us safe and this town will not be given into the hands of the king of Assyria
Isa  Do not give ear to Hezekiah for this is what the king of Assyria says Make peace with me and come out to me and everyone will be free to take the fruit of his vine and of his figtree and the water of his spring
Isa  Till I come and take you away to a land like yours a land of grain and wine a land of bread and vinegardens
Isa  Give no attention to Hezekiah when he says to you The Lord will keep us safe Has any one of the gods of the nations kept his land from falling into the hands of the king of Assyria
Isa  Where are the gods of Hamath and of Arpad where are the gods of Sepharvaim where are the gods of Samaria and have they kept Samaria out of my hand
Isa  Who among all the gods of these countries have kept their country from falling into my hand to give cause for the thought that the Lord will keep Jerusalem from falling into my hand
Isa  But they kept quiet and gave him no answer for the kings order was Give him no answer
Isa  Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah who was over the house and Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder came to Hezekiah with their clothing parted as a sign of grief and gave him an account of what the Rabshakeh had said
Isa  And on hearing it Hezekiah took off his robe and put on haircloth and went into the house of the Lord
Isa  And he sent Eliakim who was over the house and Shebna the scribe and the chief priests dressed in haircloth to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz
Isa  And they said to him Hezekiah says This day is a day of trouble and punishment and shame for the children are ready to come to birth but there is no strength to give birth to them
Isa  It may be that the Lord your God will give ear to the words of the Rabshakeh whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to say evil things against the living God and will make his words come to nothing so make your prayer for the rest of the people
Isa  So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah
Isa  And Isaiah said to them This is what you are to say to your master The Lord says Be not troubled by the words which the servants of the king of Assyria have said against me in your hearing
Isa  See I will put a spirit into him and bad news will come to his ears and he will go back to his land and there I will have him put to death
Isa  So the Rabshakeh went back and when he got there the king of Assyria was making war against Libnah for it had come to his ears that the king of Assyria had gone away from Lachish
Isa  And when news came to him that Tirhakah king of Ethiopia had made an attack on him  And he sent representatives to Hezekiah king of Judah saying
Isa  This is what you are to say to Hezekiah king of Judah Let not your God in whom is your faith give you a false hope saying Jerusalem will not be given into the hands of the king of Assyria
Isa  No doubt the story has come to your ears of what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands putting them to the curse and will you be kept safe from their fate
Isa  Did the gods of the nations keep safe those on whom my fathers sent destruction Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the children of Eden who were in Telassar
Isa  Where is the king of Hamath and the king of Arpad and the king of the town of Sepharvaim of Hena and Ivva
Isa  And Hezekiah took the letter from the hands of those who had come with it and after reading it Hezekiah went up to the house of the Lord opening the letter there before the Lord
Isa  And he made prayer to the Lord saying
Isa  O Lord of armies the God of Israel seated between the winged ones you only are the God of all the kingdoms of the earth you have made heaven and earth
Isa  Let your ear be turned to us O Lord let your eyes be open O Lord and see take note of all the words of Sennacherib who has sent men to say evil against the living God
Isa  Truly O Lord the kings of Assyria have made waste all the nations and their lands
Isa  And have given their gods to the fire for they were no gods but wood and stone the work of mens hands so they have given them to destruction
Isa  But now O Lord our God give us salvation from his hand so that it may be clear to all the kingdoms of the earth that you and you only are the Lord
Isa  Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah saying The Lord the God of Israel says The prayer you have made to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria has come to my ears
Isa  This is the word which the Lord has said about him In the eyes of the virgin daughter of Zion you are shamed and laughed at the daughter of Jerusalem has made sport of you
Isa  Against whom have you said evil and bitter things and against whom has your voice been loud and your eyes lifted up even against the Holy One of Israel
Isa  You have sent your servants with evil words against the Lord and have said With all my warcarriages I have come up to the top of the mountains to the inmost parts of Lebanon and its tall cedars will be cut down and the best trees of its woods I will come up into his highest places into his thick woods
Isa  I have made waterholes and taken their waters and with my foot I have made all the rivers of Egypt dry
Isa  Has it not come to your ears how I did it long before purposing it in times long past Now I have given effect to my design so that by you strong towns might be turned into masses of broken walls
Isa  This is why their townsmen had no power they were broken and put to shame they were like the grass of the field or a green plant like the grass on the housetops which a cold wind makes waste
Isa  But I have knowledge of your getting up and your resting of your going out and your coming in
Isa  Because your wrath against me and your pride have come to my ears I will put my hook in your nose and my cord in your lips and I will make you go back by the way you came
Isa  And this will be the sign to you you will get your food this year from what comes up of itself and in the second year from the produce of the same and in the third year you will put in your seed and get in the grain and make vinegardens and take of their fruit
Isa  And those of Judah who are still living will again take root in the earth and give fruit
Isa  For from Jerusalem those who have been kept safe will go out and those who are still living will go out of Mount Zion by the fixed purpose of the Lord of armies this will be done
Isa  For this cause the Lord says about the king of Assyria He will not come into this town or send an arrow against it he will not come before it with arms or put up an earthwork against it
Isa  By the way he came he will go back and he will not get into this town
Isa  For I will keep this town safe for my honour and for the honour of my servant David
Isa  And the angel of the Lord went out and put to death in the army of the Assyrians a hundred and eightyfive thousand men and when the people got up early in the morning there was nothing to be seen but dead bodies
Isa  Sennacherib king of Assyria went back to his place at Nineveh
Isa  And it came about when he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god that his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer put him to death with the sword and they went in flight into the land of Ararat And Esarhaddon his son became king in his place
Isa  In those days Hezekiah was ill and near death And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him and said to him The Lord says Put your house in order for your death is near
Isa  And Hezekiah turning his face to the wall made his prayer to the Lord saying
Isa  O Lord keep in mind how I have been true to you with all my heart and have done what is good in your eyes And Hezekiah gave way to bitter weeping
Isa  Then the word of the Lord came to Isaiah saying
Isa  Go to Hezekiah and say The Lord the God of David your father says Your prayer has come to my ears and I have seen your weeping see I will give you fifteen more years of life
Isa  And I will keep you and this town safe from the hands of the king of Assyria and I will keep watch over this town
Isa  And Isaiah said This is the sign the Lord will give you that he will do what he has said
Isa  See I will make the shade which has gone down on the steps of Ahaz with the sun go back ten steps So the shade went back the ten steps by which it had gone down
Isa  The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah after he had been ill and had got better from his disease
Isa  I said In the quiet of my days I am going down into the underworld the rest of my years are being taken away from me
Isa  I said I will not see the Lord even the Lord in the land of the living I will not see man again or those living in the world
Isa  My restingplace is pulled up and taken away from me like a herdsmans tent my life is rolled up like a linenworkers thread I am cut off from the cloth on the frame from day even to night you give me up to pain
Isa  I am crying out with pain till the morning it is as if a lion was crushing all my bones
Isa  I make cries like a bird I give out sounds of grief like a dove my eyes are looking up with desire O Lord I am crushed take up my cause
Isa  What am I to say seeing that it is he who has done it all my time of sleeping I am turning from side to side without rest
Isa  O Lord for this cause I am waiting for you give rest to my spirit make me well again and let me come back to life
Isa  See in place of peace my soul had bitter sorrow but you have kept back my soul from the underworld for you have put all my sins out of your memory
Isa  For the underworld is not able to give you praise death gives you no honour for those who go down into the underworld there is no hope in your mercy
Isa  The living the living man he will give you praise as I do this day the father will give the story of your mercy to his children
Isa  O Lord quickly be my saviour so we will make my songs to corded instruments all the days of our lives in the house of the Lord
Isa  And Isaiah said Let them take a cake of figs and put it on the diseased place and he will get well
Isa  And Hezekiah said What is the sign that I will go up to the house of the Lord
Isa  At that time Merodachbaladan the son of Baladan king of Babylon sent letters with an offering to Hezekiah because he had news that Hezekiah had been ill and was well again
Isa  And Hezekiah was glad at their coming and let them see all his store of wealth the silver and the gold and the spices and the oil and all the house of his arms and everything there was in his stores there was nothing in all his house or his kingdom which he did not let them see
Isa  Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said to him What did these men say and where did they come from And Hezekiah said They came from a far country even from Babylon
Isa  And he said What have they seen in your house And Hezekiah said in answer They saw everything in my house there is nothing among my stores which I did not let them see
Isa  Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah Give ear to the word of the Lord of armies
Isa  Truly the days are coming when everything in your house and whatever your fathers have put in store till this day will be taken away to Babylon all will be gone
Isa  And your sons even your offspring will they take away to be unsexed servants in the house of the king of Babylon
Isa  Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah Good is the word of the Lord which you have said And he said in his heart There will be peace and quiet in my days
Isa  Give comfort give comfort to my people says your God
Isa  Say kind words to the heart of Jerusalem crying out to her that her time of trouble is ended that her punishment is complete that she has been rewarded by the Lords hand twice over for all her sins
Isa  A voice of one crying Make ready in the waste land the way of the Lord make level in the lowland a highway for our God
Isa  Let every valley be lifted up and every mountain and hill be made low and let the rough places become level and the hilltops become a valley
Isa  And the glory of the Lord will be made clear and all flesh will see it together for the mouth of the Lord has said it
Isa  A voice of one saying Give a cry And I said What is my cry to be All flesh is grass and all its strength like the flower of the field
Isa  The grass becomes dry the flower is dead because the breath of the Lord goes over it truly the people is grass
Isa  The grass is dry the flower is dead but the word of our God is eternal
Isa  You who give good news to Zion get up into the high mountain you who give good news to Jerusalem let your voice be strong let it be sounding without fear say to the towns of Judah See your God
Isa  See the Lord God will come as a strong one ruling in power see those made free by him are with him and those whom he has made safe go before him
Isa  He will give food to his flock like a keeper of sheep with his arm he will get it together and will take up the lambs on his breast gently guiding those which are with young
Isa  In the hollow of whose hand have the waters been measured and who is able to take the heavens in his stretchedout fingers who has got together the dust of the earth in a measure who has taken the weight of the mountains or put the hills into the scales
Isa  By whom has the spirit of the Lord been guided or who has been his teacher
Isa  Who gave him suggestions and made clear to him the right way who gave him knowledge guiding him in the way of wisdom
Isa  See the nations are to him like a drop hanging from a bucket and like the small dust in the scales he takes up the islands like small dust
Isa  And Lebanon is not enough to make a fire with or all its cattle enough for a burned offering
Isa  All the nations are as nothing before him even less than nothing a thing of no value
Isa  Whom then is God like in your opinion or what will you put forward as a comparison with him
Isa  The workman makes an image and the goldworker puts gold plates over it and makes silver bands for it
Isa  The wise workman makes selection of the mulberrytree of the offering a wood which will not become soft so that the image may be fixed to it and not be moved
Isa  Have you no knowledge of it has it not come to your ears has not news of it been given to you from the first has it not been clear to you from the time when the earth was placed on its base
Isa  It is he who is seated over the arch of the earth and the people in it are as small as locusts by him the heavens are stretched out like an arch and made ready like a tent for a livingplace
Isa  He makes rulers come to nothing the judges of the earth are of no value
Isa  They have only now been planted and their seed put into the earth and they have only now taken root when he sends out his breath over them and they become dry and the stormwind takes them away like dry grass
Isa  Who then seems to you to be my equal says the Holy One
Isa  Let your eyes be lifted up on high and see who has made these He who sends out their numbered army who has knowledge of all their names by whose great strength because he is strong in power all of them are in their places
Isa  Why do you say O Jacob such words as these O Israel The Lords eyes are not on my way and my God gives no attention to my cause
Isa  Have you no knowledge of it has it not come to your ears The eternal God the Lord the Maker of the ends of the earth is never feeble or tired there is no searching out of his wisdom
Isa  He gives power to the feeble increasing the strength of him who has no force
Isa  Even the young men will become feeble and tired and the best of them will come to the end of his strength
Isa  But those who are waiting for the Lord will have new strength they will get wings like eagles running they will not be tired and walking they will have no weariness
Isa  Come quietly before me O sealands and let the peoples get together their strength let them come near then let them say what they have to say let us put forward our cause against one another
Isa  Who sent out from the east one who is right wherever he goes he gives the nations into his hands and makes him ruler over kings he gives them as the dust to his sword as dry stems before the wind to his bow
Isa  He goes after them safely not touching the road with his feet
Isa  Whose purpose and work was it His who sent out the generations from the start I the Lord the first and with the last I am he
Isa  The sealands saw it and were in fear the ends of the earth were shaking they came near
Isa  They gave help everyone to his neighbour and everyone said to his brother Take heart
Isa  So the metalworker put heart into the goldworker and he who was hammering the metal smooth said kind words to the ironworker saying of the plate It is ready and he put it together with nails so that there might be no slipping
Isa  But as for you Israel my servant and you Jacob whom I have taken for myself the seed of Abraham my friend
Isa  You whom I have taken from the ends of the earth and sent for from its farthest parts saying to you You are my servant whom I have taken for myself and whom I have not given up
Isa  Have no fear for I am with you do not be looking about in trouble for I am your God I will give you strength yes I will be your helper yes my true right hand will be your support
Isa  Truly all those who are angry with you will be made low and put to shame those desiring to do you wrong will come to nothing and never again be seen
Isa  You will make search for your haters but they will not be there those who make war against you will be as nothing and will come to destruction
Isa  For I the Lord your God have taken your right hand in mine saying to you Have no fear I will be your helper
Isa  Have no fear you worm Jacob and you men of Israel I will be your helper says the Lord even he who takes up your cause the Holy One of Israel
Isa  See I will make you like a new graincrushing instrument with teeth crushing the mountains small and making the hills like dry stems
Isa  You will send the wind over them and it will take them away they will go in all directions before the stormwind you will have joy in the Lord and be glad in the Holy One of Israel
Isa  The poor and crushed are looking for water where no water is and their tongue is dry for need of it I the Lord will give ear to their prayer I the God of Israel will not give them up
Isa  I will make rivers on the dry mountaintops and fountains in the valleys I will make the waste land a pool of water and the dry land springs of water
Isa  I will put in the waste land the cedar the acacia the myrtle and the olivetree and in the lowland will be planted the firtree the plane and the cypress together
Isa  So that they may see and be wise and give their mind to it and that it may be clear to them all that the hand of the Lord has done this and that the Holy One of Israel has made it
Isa  Put forward your cause says the Lord let your strong argument come out says the King of Jacob
Isa  Let the future be made clear to us give us news of the past things so that we may give thought to them or of the things to come so that we may see if they are true
Isa  Give us word of what will be after this so that we may be certain that you are gods yes do good or do evil so that we may all see it and be surprised
Isa  But you are nothing and your work is of no value foolish is he who takes you for his gods
Isa  I have sent for one from the north and from the dawn he has come in my name he will get rulers together and go against them they will be like dust even as the wet earth is stamped on by the feet of the potter
Isa  Who has given knowledge of it from the first so that we may be certain of it and from the start so that we may say His word is true There is no one who gives news or says anything or who gives ear to your words
Isa  I was the first to give word of it to Zion and I gave the good news to Jerusalem
Isa  And I saw that there was no man even no wise man among them who might give an answer to my questions
Isa  Truly they are all nothing their works are nothing and of no value their metal images are of no more use than wind
Isa  See my servant whom I am supporting my loved one in whom I take delight I have put my spirit on him he will give the knowledge of the true God to the nations
Isa  He will make no cry his voice will not be loud his words will not come to mens ears in the streets
Isa  He will not let a crushed stem be quite broken and he will not let a feebly burning light be put out he will go on sending out the true word to the peoples
Isa  His light will not be put out and he will not be crushed till he has given the knowledge of the true God to the earth and the sealands will be waiting for his teaching
Isa  God the Lord even he who made the heavens measuring them out on high stretching out the earth and giving its produce he who gives breath to the people on it and life to those who go about on it says
Isa  I the Lord have made you the vessel of my purpose I have taken you by the hand and kept you safe and I have given you to be an agreement to the people and a light to the nations
Isa  To give eyes to the blind to make free the prisoners from the prison to let out those who are shut up in the dark
Isa  I am the Lord that is my name I will not give my glory to another or my praise to pictured images
Isa  See the things said before have come about and now I give word of new things before they come I give you news of them
Isa  Make a new song to the Lord and let his praise be sounded from the end of the earth you who go down to the sea and everything in it the sealands and their people
Isa  Let the waste land and its flocks be glad the tentcircles of Kedar let the people of the rock give a glad cry from the top of the mountains let them make a sound of joy
Isa  Let them give glory to the Lord sounding his praise in the sealands
Isa  The Lord will go out as a man of war he will be moved to wrath like a fightingman his voice will be strong he will give a loud cry he will go against his attackers like a man of war
Isa  I have long been quiet I have kept myself in and done nothing now I will make sounds of pain like a woman in childbirth breathing hard and quickly
Isa  I will make waste mountains and hills drying up all their plants and I will make rivers dry and pools dry land
Isa  And I will take the blind by a way of which they had no knowledge guiding them by roads strange to them I will make the dark places light before them and the rough places level These things will I do and will not give them up
Isa  They will be turned back and be greatly shamed who put their hope in pictured images who say to metal images You are our gods
Isa  Give ear you whose ears are shut and let your eyes be open you blind so that you may see
Isa  Who is blind but my servant who has his ears stopped but he whom I send who is blind as my true one or who has his ears shut like the Lords servant
Isa  Seeing much but keeping nothing in mind his ears are open but there is no hearing
Isa  It was the Lords pleasure because of his righteousness to make the teaching great and give it honour
Isa  But this is a people whose property has been taken away from them by force they are all taken in holes and shut up in prisons they are made prisoners and no one makes them free they are taken by force and no one says Give them back
Isa  Who is there among you who will give ear to this who will give attention to it for the time to come
Isa  Who gave up Jacob to those who took away his goods and Israel to his attackers Did not the Lord he against whom they did wrong and in whose ways they would not go turning away from his teaching
Isa  For this reason he let loose on him the heat of his wrath and his strength was like a flame and it put fire round about him but he did not see it he was burned but did not take it to heart
Isa  But now says the Lord your Maker O Jacob and your lifegiver O Israel have no fear for I have taken up your cause naming you by your name I have made you mine
Isa  When you go through the waters I will be with you and through the rivers they will not go over you when you go through the fire you will not be burned and the flame will have no power over you
Isa  For I am the Lord your God the Holy One of Israel your saviour I have given Egypt as a price for you Ethiopia and Seba for you
Isa  Because of your value in my eyes you have been honoured and loved by me so I will give men for you and peoples for your life
Isa  Have no fear for I am with you I will take your seed from the east and get you together from the west
Isa  I will say to the north Give them up and to the south Do not keep them back send back my sons from far and my daughters from the end of the earth
Isa  Every one who is named by my name and whom I have made for my glory who has been formed and designed by me
Isa  Send out the blind people who have eyes and those who have ears but they are shut
Isa  Let all the nations come together and let the peoples be present who among them is able to make this clear and give us word of earlier things let their witnesses come forward so that they may be seen to be true and that they may give ear and say It is true
Isa  You are my witnesses says the Lord and my servant whom I have taken for myself so that you may see and have faith in me and that it may be clear to you that I am he before me there was no God formed and there will not be after me
Isa  I even I am the Lord and there is no saviour but me
Isa  I gave the word and made it clear and there was no strange god among you for this reason you are my witnesses says the Lord
Isa  From time long past I am God and from this day I am he there is no one who is able to take you out of my hand when I undertake a thing by whom will my purpose be changed
Isa  The Lord who has taken up your cause the Holy One of Israel says Because of you I have sent to Babylon and made all their seers come south and the Chaldaeans whose cry is in the ships
Isa  I am the Lord your Holy One the Maker of Israel your King
Isa  This is the word of the Lord who makes a way in the sea and a road through the deep waters
Isa  Who sends out the warcarriages and the horses the army with all its force they have come down they will not get up again like a feebly burning light they are put out
Isa  Give no thought to the things which are past let the early times go out of your minds
Isa  See I am doing a new thing now it is starting will you not take note of it I will even make a way in the waste land and rivers in the dry country
Isa  The beasts of the field will give me honour the jackals and the ostriches because I send out waters in the waste land and rivers in the dry country to give drink to the people whom I have taken for myself
Isa  Even the people whom I made to be the witnesses of my praise
Isa  But you have made no prayer to me O Jacob and you have given no thought to me O Israel
Isa  You have not made me burned offerings of sheep or given me honour with your offerings of beasts I did not make you servants to give me an offering and I did not make you tired with requests for perfumes
Isa  You have not got me sweetsmelling plants with your money or given me pleasure with the fat of your offerings but you have made me a servant to your sins and you have made me tired with your evil doings
Isa  I even I am he who takes away your sins and I will no longer keep your evil doings in mind
Isa  Put me in mind of this let us take up the cause between us put forward your cause so that you may be seen to be in the right
Isa  Your first father was a sinner and your guides have gone against my word
Isa  Your chiefs have made my holy place unclean so I have made Jacob a curse and Israel a thing of shame
Isa  And now give ear O Jacob my servant and Israel whom I have taken for myself
Isa  The Lord who made you forming you in your mothers body the Lord your helper says Have no fear O Jacob my servant and you Jeshurun whom I have taken for myself
Isa  For I will send water on the land needing it and streams on the dry earth I will let my spirit come down on your seed and my blessing on your offspring
Isa  And they will come up like grass in a wellwatered field like waterplants by the streams
Isa  One will say I am the Lords and another will give himself the name Jacob another will put a mark on his hand I am the Lords and another will take the name of Israel for himself
Isa  The Lord the King of Israel even the Lord of armies who has taken up his cause says I am the first and the last and there is no God but me
Isa  If there is one like me let him come forward and say it let him make it clear and put it in order before me who has made clear in the past the things to come let him make clear the future to me
Isa  Have no fear be strong in heart have I not made it clear to you in the past and let you see it and you are my witnesses Is there any God but me or a Rock of whom I have no knowledge
Isa  Those who make a pictured image are all of them as nothing and the things of their desire will be of no profit to them and their servants see not and have no knowledge so they will be put to shame
Isa  Whoever makes a god makes nothing but a metal image in which there is no profit
Isa  Truly all those who make use of secret arts will be put to shame and their words of power are only words of men let them all come forward together they will all be in fear and be put to shame
Isa  The ironworker is heating the metal in the fire giving it form with his hammers and working on it with his strong arm then for need of food his strength gives way and for need of water he becomes feeble
Isa  The woodworker is measuring out the wood with his line marking it out with his pencil after smoothing it with his plane and making circles on it with his instrument he gives it the form and glory of a man so that it may be placed in the house
Isa  He has cedars cut down for himself he takes an oak and lets it get strong among the trees of the wood he has an ashtree planted and the rain gives it growth
Isa  Then it will be used to make a fire so that a man may get warm he has the oven heated with it and makes bread he makes a god with it to which he gives worship he makes a pictured image out of it and goes down on his face before it
Isa  With part of it he makes a fire and on the fire he gets meat cooked and takes a full meal he makes himself warm and says Aha I am warm I have seen the fire
Isa  And the rest of it he makes into a god even his pictured image he goes down on his face before it giving worship to it and making prayer to it saying Be my saviour for you are my god
Isa  They have no knowledge or wisdom for he has put a veil over their eyes so that they may not see and on their hearts so that they may not give attention
Isa  And no one takes note no one has enough knowledge or wisdom to say I have put part of it in the fire and made bread on it I have had a meal of the flesh cooked with it and am I now to make the rest of it into a false god am I to go down on my face before a bit of wood
Isa  As for him whose food is the dust of a dead fire he has been turned from the way by a twisted mind so that he is unable to keep himself safe by saying What I have here in my hand is false
Isa  Keep these things in mind O Jacob and you Israel for you are my servant I have made you you are my servant O Israel I will not let you go out of my memory
Isa  I have put your evil doings out of my mind like a thick cloud and your sins like a mist come back to me for I have taken up your cause
Isa  Make a song O heavens for the Lord has done it give a loud cry you deep parts of the earth let your voices be loud in song you mountains and you woods with all your trees for the Lord has taken up the cause of Jacob and will let his glory be seen in Israel
Isa  The Lord who has taken up your cause and who gave you life in your mothers body says I am the Lord who makes all things stretching out the heavens by myself and giving the earth its limits who was with me
Isa  Who makes the signs of those who give word of the future come to nothing so that those who have knowledge of secret arts go off their heads turning the wise men back and making their knowledge foolish
Isa  Who makes the word of his servants certain and gives effect to the purposes of his representatives who says of Jerusalem Her people will come back to her and of the towns of Judah I will give orders for their building and will make her waste places fertile again
Isa  Who says to the deep Be dry and I will make your rivers dry
Isa  Who says of Cyrus He will take care of my sheep and will do all my pleasure who says of Jerusalem I will give the word for your building and of the Temple Your bases will be put in place
Isa  The Lord says to the man of his selection to Cyrus whom I have taken by the right hand putting down nations before him and taking away the arms of kings making the doors open before him so that the ways into the towns may not be shut
Isa  I will go before you and make the rough places level the doors of brass will be broken and the iron rods cut in two
Isa  And I will give you the stores of the dark and the wealth of secret places so that you may be certain that I am the Lord who gave you your name even the God of Israel
Isa  Because of Jacob my servant and Israel whom I have taken for myself I have sent for you by name giving you a name of honour though you had no knowledge of me
Isa  I am the Lord and there is no other there is no God but me I will make you ready for war though you had no knowledge of me
Isa  So that they may see from the east and from the west that there is no God but me I am the Lord and there is no other
Isa  I am the giver of light and the maker of the dark causing blessing and sending troubles I am the Lord who does all these things
Isa  Let righteousness come down O heavens from on high and let the sky send it down like rain let the earth be open to give the fruit of salvation causing righteousness to come up with it I the Lord have made it come about
Isa  Cursed is he who has an argument with his Maker the pot which has an argument with the Potter Will the wet earth say to him who is working with it What are you doing that your work has nothing by which it may be gripped
Isa  Cursed is he who says to a father To what are you giving life or to a woman What are you in birthpains with
Isa  The Lord the Holy One of Israel and his Maker says Will you put a question to me about the things which are to come or will you give me orders about my sons and the work of my hands
Isa  I have made the earth forming man on it by my hands the heavens have been stretched out and all the stars put in their ordered places
Isa  I have sent him out to overcome the nations and I will make all his ways straight I will give him the work of building my town and he will let my prisoners go free without price or reward says the Lord of armies
Isa  The Lord says The workmen of Egypt and the traders of Ethiopia and the tall Sabaeans will come over the sea to you and they will be yours they will go after you in chains they will come over and they will go down on their faces before you and will make prayer to you saying Truly God is among you and there is no other God
Isa  Truly you have a secret God the God of Israel is a Saviour
Isa  All those who have gone against him will be put to shame the makers of images will be made low
Isa  But the Lord will make Israel free with an eternal salvation you will not be put to shame or made low for ever and ever
Isa  For this is the word of the Lord who made the heavens he is God the maker and designer of the earth who made it not to be a waste but as a livingplace for man I am the Lord and there is no other
Isa  I have not given my word in secret in a place in the underworld I did not say to the seed of Jacob Go into a waste land to make request of me I the Lord say what is true my word is righteousness
Isa  Come together even come near you nations who are still living they have no knowledge who take up their image of wood and make prayer to a god in whom is no salvation
Isa  Give the word put forward your cause let us have a discussion together who has given news of this in the past who made it clear in early times did not I the Lord and there is no God but me a true God and a saviour there is no other
Isa  Let your hearts be turned to me so that you may have salvation all the ends of the earth for I am God and there is no other
Isa  By myself have I taken an oath a true word has gone from my mouth and will not be changed that to me every knee will be bent and every tongue will give honour
Isa  Only in the Lord will Jacob overcome and be strong together all those who were angry with him will be put to shame and come to destruction
Isa  In the Lord will all the seed of Israel get their rights and they will give glory to him
Isa  Bel is bent down Nebo is falling their images are on the beasts and on the cattle the things which you took about have become a weight to the tired beast
Isa  They are bent down they are falling together they were not able to keep their images safe but they themselves have been taken prisoner
Isa  Give ear to me O family of Jacob and all the rest of the people of Israel who have been supported by me from their birth and have been my care from their earliest days
Isa  Even when you are old I will be the same and when you are greyhaired I will take care of you I will still be responsible for what I made yes I will take you and keep you safe
Isa  Who in your eyes is my equal or what comparison will you make with me
Isa  As for those who take gold out of a bag and put silver in the scales they give payment to a goldworker to make it into a god they go down on their faces and give it worship
Isa  They put him on their backs and take him up and put him in his fixed place from which he may not be moved if a man gives a cry for help to him he is unable to give an answer or get him out of his trouble
Isa  Keep this in mind and be shamed let it come back to your memory you sinners
Isa  Let the things which are past come to your memory for I am God and there is no other I am God and there is no one like me
Isa  Making clear from the first what is to come and from past times the things which have not so far come about saying My purpose is fixed and I will do all my pleasure
Isa  Sending for a bird of strong flight from the east the man of my purpose from a far country I have said it and I will give effect to it the thing designed by me will certainly be done
Isa  Give ear to me you feeblehearted who have no faith in my righteousness
Isa  My righteousness is near it is not far off salvation will come quickly and I will make Zion free and give Israel my glory
Isa  Come and take your seat in the dust O virgin daughter of Babylon come down from your seat of power and take your place on the earth O daughter of the Chaldaeans for you will never again seem soft and delicate
Isa  Take the crushingstones and get the meal crushed take off your veil put away your robe let your legs be uncovered go through the rivers
Isa  The shame of your unclothed condition will be seen by all I will give punishment without mercy
Isa  Says the Lord who takes up our cause the Lord of armies is his name the Holy One of Israel
Isa  Be seated in the dark without a word O daughter of the Chaldaeans for you will no longer be named The Queen of Kingdoms
Isa  I was angry with my people I put shame on my heritage and gave them into your hands you had no mercy on them you put a cruel yoke on those who were old
Isa  And you said I will be a queen for ever you did not give attention to these things and did not keep in mind what would come after
Isa  So now take note of this you who are given up to pleasure living without fear of evil saying in your heart I am and there is no one like me I will never be a widow or have my children taken from me
Isa  But these two things will come on you suddenly in one day the loss of children and of husband in full measure they will come on you for all your secret arts and all your wonders
Isa  For you had faith in your evildoing you said No one sees me by your wisdom and knowledge you have been turned out of the way and you have said in your heart I am and there is no other
Isa  Because of this evil will come on you which may not be turned away for any price and trouble will overtake you from which no money will give salvation destruction will come on you suddenly without your knowledge
Isa  Go on now with your secret arts and all your wonderworking to which you have given yourself up from your earliest days it may be that they will be of profit to you or by them you may put fear into your attackers
Isa  But your mind is troubled by the number of your guides let them now come forward for your salvation the measurers of the heavens the watchers of the stars and those who are able to say from month to month what things are coming on you
Isa  Truly they have become like dry stems they have been burned in the fire they are not able to keep themselves safe from the power of the flame it is not a coal for warming them or a fire by which a man may be seated
Isa  Small profit have you had from those who from your earliest days got great profit out of you they have gone in flight every one straight before him and you have no saviour
Isa  Give ear to this O family of Jacob you who are named by the name of Israel and have come out of the body of Judah who take oaths by the name of the Lord and make use of the name of the God of Israel but not truly and not in good faith
Isa  For they say that they are of the holy town and put their faith in the God of Israel the Lord of armies is his name
Isa  I gave word in the past of the things which came about they came from my mouth and I made them clear suddenly I did them and they came about
Isa  Because I saw that your heart was hard and that your neck was an iron cord and your brow brass
Isa  For this reason I made it clear to you in the past before it came I gave you word of it for fear that you might say My god did these things and my pictured and metal images made them come about
Isa  All this has come to your ears and you have seen it will you not give witness to it I am now making clear new things even secret things of which you had no knowledge
Isa  They have only now been effected and not in the past and before this day they had not come to your ears for fear that you might say I had knowledge of them
Isa  Truly you had no word of them no knowledge of them no news of them in the past had come to your ears because I saw how false was your behaviour and that your heart was turned against me from your earliest days
Isa  Because of my name I will put away my wrath and for my praise I will keep myself from cutting you off
Isa  See I have been testing you for myself like silver I have put you through the fire of trouble
Isa  For myself even because of my name I will do it for I will not let my name be shamed and my glory I will not give to another
Isa  Give ear to me Jacob and Israel my loved one I am he I am the first and I am the last
Isa  Yes by my hand was the earth placed on its base and by my right hand the heavens were stretched out at my word they take up their places
Isa  Come together all of you and give ear who among you has given news of these things the Lords loved one will do his pleasure with Babylon and with the seed of the Chaldaeans
Isa  I even I have given the word I have sent for him I have made him come and have given effect to his undertakings
Isa  Come near to me and give ear to this from the start I did not keep it secret from the time of its coming into existence I was there and now the Lord God has sent me and given me his spirit
Isa  The Lord who takes up your cause the Holy One of Israel says I am the Lord your God who is teaching you for your profit guiding you by the way in which you are to go
Isa  If only you had given ear to my orders then your peace would have been like a river and your righteousness as the waves of the sea
Isa  Your seed would have been like the sand and your offspring like the dust your name would not be cut off or come to an end before me
Isa  Go out of Babylon go in flight from the Chaldaeans with the sound of song make it clear give the news let the word go out even to the end of the earth say The Lord has taken up the cause of his servant Jacob
Isa  They had no need of water when he was guiding them through the waste lands he made water come out of the rock for them the rock was parted and the waters came flowing out
Isa  There is no peace says the Lord for the evildoers
Isa  Give ear O sealands to me and take note you peoples from far I have been marked out by the Lord from the first when I was still in my mothers body he had my name in mind
Isa  And he has made my mouth like a sharp sword in the shade of his hand he has kept me and he has made me like a polished arrow keeping me in his secret place
Isa  And he said to me You are my servant Israel in whom my glory will be seen
Isa  And I said I have undergone weariness for nothing I have given my strength for no purpose or profit but still the Lord will take up my cause and my God will give me my reward
Isa  And now says the Lord who made me his servant when I was still in my mothers body so that I might make Jacob come back to him and so that Israel might come together to him and I was honoured in the eyes of the Lord and my God became my strength
Isa  It is not enough for one who is my servant to put the tribes of Jacob again in their place and to get back those of Israel who have been sent away my purpose is to give you as a light to the nations so that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth
Isa  The Lord who takes up Israels cause even his Holy One says to him whom men make sport of who is hated by the nations a servant of rulers Kings will see and get up from their places and chiefs will give worship because of the Lord who keeps faith even the Holy One of Israel who has taken you for himself
Isa  This is the word of the Lord I have given ear to you at a good time and I have been your helper in a day of salvation and I will keep you safe and will make you a glory for the people putting the land in order and giving them the heritages which now are waste
Isa  Saying to those who are in chains Go free to those who are in the dark Come out into the light They will get food by the way wherever they go and have grasslands on all the dry mountaintops
Isa  They will not be in need of food or drink or be troubled by the heat or the sun for he who has mercy on them will be their guide taking them by the springs of water
Isa  And I will make all my mountains a way and my highways will be lifted up
Isa  See these are coming from far and these from the north and the west and these from the land of Sinim
Isa  Let your voice be loud in song O heavens and be glad O earth make sounds of joy O mountains for the Lord has given comfort to his people and will have mercy on his crushed ones
Isa  But Zion said The Lord has given me up I have gone from his memory
Isa  Will a woman give up the child at her breast will she be without pity for the fruit of her body yes these may but I will not let you go out of my memory
Isa  See your name is marked on my hands your walls are ever before me
Isa  Your builders are coming quickly your haters and those who made you waste will go out of you
Isa  Let your eyes be lifted up round about and see they are all coming together to you By my life says the Lord truly you will put them all on you as an ornament and be clothed with them like a bride
Isa  For though the waste places of your land have been given to destruction now you will not be wide enough for your people and those who made you waste will be far away
Isa  The children to whom you gave birth in other lands will say in your ears The place is not wide enough for me make room for me to have a restingplace
Isa  Then you will say in your heart Who has given me all these children when my children had been taken from me and I was no longer able to have others who took care of these when I was by myself where then were these
Isa  This is the word of the Lord God See I will make a sign with my hand to the nations and put up my flag for the peoples and they will take up your sons on their beasts and your daughters on their backs
Isa  And kings will take care of you and queens will give you their milk they will go down on their faces before you kissing the dust of your feet and you will be certain that I am the Lord and that those who put their hope in me will not be shamed
Isa  Will the goods of war be taken from the strong man or the prisoners of the cruel one be let go
Isa  But the Lord says Even the prisoners of the strong will be taken from him and the cruel made to let go his goods for I will take up your cause against your haters and I will keep your children safe
Isa  And the flesh of your attackers will be taken by themselves for food and they will take their blood for drink as if it was sweet wine and all men will see that I the Lord am your saviour even he who takes up your cause the Strong One of Jacob
Isa  This is the word of the Lord Where is the statement which I gave your mother when I put her away or to which of my creditors have I given you for money It was for your sins that you were given into the hands of others and for your evildoing was your mother put away
Isa  Why then when I came was there no man and no one to give answer to my voice has my hand become feeble so that it is unable to take up your cause or have I no power to make you free See at my word the sea becomes dry I make the rivers a waste land their fish are dead for need of water and make an evil smell
Isa  By me the heavens are clothed with black and I make haircloth their robe
Isa  The Lord God has given me the tongue of those who are experienced so that I may be able to give the word a special sense for the feeble every morning my ear is open to his teaching like those who are experienced
Isa  And I have not put myself against him or let my heart be turned back from him
Isa  I was offering my back to those who gave me blows and my face to those who were pulling out my hair I did not keep my face covered from marks of shame
Isa  For the Lord God is my helper I will not be put to shame so I have made my face like a rock and I am certain that he will give me my right
Isa  He who takes up my cause is near who will go to law with me let us come together before the judge who is against me let him come near to me
Isa  See the Lord God is my helper who will give a decision against me truly all of them will become old like a robe they will be food for the worm
Isa  Who among you has the fear of the Lord giving ear to the voice of his servant who has been walking in the dark and has no light Let him put his faith in the name of the Lord looking to his God for support
Isa  See all you who make a fire arming yourselves with burning branches go in the flame of your fire and among the branches you have put a light to This will you have from my hand you will make your bed in sorrow
Isa  Give ear to me you who are searching for righteousness who are looking for the Lord see the rock from which you were cut out and the hole out of which you were taken
Isa  Let your thoughts be turned to Abraham your father and to Sarah who gave you birth for when he was but one my voice came to him and I gave him my blessing and made him a great people
Isa  For the Lord has given comfort to Zion he has made glad all her broken walls making her waste places like Eden and changing her dry land into the garden of the Lord joy and delight will be there praise and the sound of melody
Isa  Give attention to me O my people and give ear to me O my nation for teaching will go out from me and the knowledge of the true God will be a light to the peoples
Isa  Suddenly will my righteousness come near and my salvation will be shining out like the light the sealands will be waiting for me and they will put their hope in my strong arm
Isa  Let your eyes be lifted up to the heavens and turned to the earth which is under them for the heavens will go in flight like smoke and the earth will become old like a coat and its people will come to destruction like insects but my salvation will be for ever and my righteousness will not come to an end
Isa  Give ear to me you who have knowledge of righteousness in whose heart is my law have no fear of the evil words of men and give no thought to their curses
Isa  For like a coat they will be food for the insect the worm will make a meal of them like wool but my righteousness will be for ever and my salvation to all generations
Isa  Awake awake put on strength O arm of the Lord awake as in the old days in the generations long past Was it not by you that Rahab was cut in two and the dragon Wounded
Isa  Did you not make the sea dry the waters of the great deep did you not make the deep waters of the sea a way for the Lords people to go through
Isa  Those whom the Lord has made free will come back with songs to Zion and on their heads will be eternal joy delight and joy will be theirs and sorrow and sounds of grief will be gone for ever
Isa  I even I am your comforter are you so poor in heart as to be in fear of man who will come to an end and of the son of man who will be like grass
Isa  And you have given no thought to the Lord your Maker by whom the heavens were stretched out and the earth placed on its base and you went all day in fear of the wrath of the cruel one when he was making ready for your destruction And where is the wrath of the cruel one
Isa  The prisoner bent under his chain will quickly be made free and will not go down into the underworld and his bread will not come to an end
Isa  For I am the Lord your God who makes the sea calm when its waves are thundering the Lord of armies is his name
Isa  And I have put my words in your mouth covering you with the shade of my hand stretching out the heavens and placing the earth on its base and saying to Zion You are my people
Isa  Awake awake up O Jerusalem you who have taken from the Lords hand the cup of his wrath tasting in full measure the wine which overcomes
Isa  She has no one among all her children to be her guide not one of the sons she has taken care of takes her by the hand
Isa  These two things have come on you who will be weeping for you wasting and destruction death from need of food and from the sword how may you be comforted
Isa  Your sons are overcome like a roe in a net they are full of the wrath of the Lord the punishment of your God
Isa  So now give ear to this you who are troubled and overcome but not with wine
Isa  This is the word of the Lord your master even your God who takes up the cause of his people See I have taken out of your hand the cup which overcomes even the cup of my wrath it will not again be given to you
Isa  And I will put it into the hand of your cruel masters and of those whose yoke has been hard on you who have said to your soul Down on your face so that we may go over you and you have given your backs like the earth even like the street for them to go over
Isa  Awake awake put on your strength O Zion put on your beautiful robes O Jerusalem the holy town for from now there will never again come into you the unclean and those without circumcision
Isa  Make yourself clean from the dust up and take the seat of your power O Jerusalem the bands of your neck are loose O prisoned daughter of Zion
Isa  For the Lord says You were given for nothing and you will be made free without price
Isa  For the Lord God says My people went down at first into Egypt to get a place for themselves there and the Assyrian put a cruel yoke on them without cause
Isa  Now then what have I here says the Lord for my people are taken away without cause they are made waste and give cries of sorrow says the Lord and all the day the nations put shame on my name
Isa  For this cause I will make my name clear to my people in that day they will be certain that it is my word which comes to them see here am I
Isa  How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him who comes with good news who gives word of peace saying that salvation is near who says to Zion Your God is ruling
Isa  The voice of your watchmen their voices are loud in song together for they will see him eye to eye when the Lord comes back to Zion
Isa  Give sounds of joy make melody together waste places of Jerusalem for the Lord has given comfort to his people he has taken up the cause of Jerusalem
Isa  The Lord has let his holy arm be seen by the eyes of all nations and all the ends of the earth will see the salvation of our God
Isa  Away away go out from there touching no unclean thing go out from among her be clean you who take up the vessels of the Lord
Isa  For you will not go out suddenly and you will not go in flight for the Lord will go before you and the God of Israel will come after you to keep you
Isa  See my servant will do well in his undertakings he will be honoured and lifted up and be very high
Isa  As peoples were surprised at him And his face was not beautiful so as to be desired his face was so changed by disease as to be unlike that of a man and his form was no longer that of the sons of men
Isa  So will nations give him honour kings will keep quiet because of him for what had not been made clear to them they will see and they will give their minds to what had not come to their ears
Isa  Who would have had faith in the word which has come to our ears and to whom had the arm of the Lord been unveiled
Isa  For his growth was like that of a delicate plant before him and like a root out of a dry place he had no grace of form to give us pleasure
Isa  Men made sport of him turning away from him he was a man of sorrows marked by disease and like one from whom mens faces are turned away he was looked down on and we put no value on him
Isa  But it was our pain he took and our diseases were put on him while to us he seemed as one diseased on whom Gods punishment had come
Isa  But it was for our sins he was wounded and for our evil doings he was crushed he took the punishment by which we have peace and by his wounds we are made well
Isa  We all went wandering like sheep going every one of us after his desire and the Lord put on him the punishment of us all
Isa  Men were cruel to him but he was gentle and quiet as a lamb taken to its death and as a sheep before those who take her wool makes no sound so he said not a word
Isa  They took away from him help and right and who gave a thought to his fate for he was cut off from the land of the living he came to his death for the sin of my people
Isa  And they put his body into the earth with sinners and his last restingplace was with the evildoers though he had done no wrong and no deceit was in his mouth
Isa  And the Lord was pleased  see a seed long life  will do well in his hand 
Isa   made clear his righteousness before men  had taken their sins on himself
Isa  For this cause he will have a heritage with the great and he will have a part in the goods of war with the strong because he gave up his life and was numbered with the evildoers taking on himself the sins of the people and making prayer for the wrongdoers
Isa  Let your voice be loud in song O woman without children make melody and sounds of joy you who did not give birth for the children of her who had no husband are more than those of the married wife says the Lord
Isa  Make wide the place of your tent and let the curtains of your house be stretched out without limit make your cords long and your tentpins strong
Isa  For I will make wide your limits on the right hand and on the left and your seed will take the nations for a heritage and make the waste towns full of people
Isa  Have no fear for you will not be shamed or without hope you will not be put to shame for the shame of your earlier days will go out of your memory and you will no longer keep in mind the sorrows of your widowed years
Isa  For your Maker is your husband the Lord of armies is his name and the Holy One of Israel is he who takes up your cause he will be named the God of all the earth
Isa  For the Lord has made you come back to him like a wife who has been sent away in grief of spirit for one may not give up the wife of ones early days
Isa  For a short time I gave you up but with great mercies I will take you back again
Isa  In overflowing wrath my face was veiled from you for a minute but I will have pity on you for ever says the Lord who takes up your cause
Isa  For this is like the days of Noah to me for as I took an oath that the waters of Noah would never again go over the earth so have I taken an oath that I will not again be angry with you or say bitter words to you
Isa  For the mountains may be taken away and the hills be moved out of their places but my love will not be taken from you or my agreement of peace broken says the Lord who has had mercy on you
Isa  O troubled one stormcrushed uncomforted see your stones will be framed in fair colours and your bases will be sapphires
Isa  I will make your towers of rubies and your doors of carbuncles and the wall round you will be of all sorts of beautiful stones
Isa  And all your builders will be made wise by the Lord and great will be the peace of your children
Isa  All your rights will be made certain to you have no fear of evil and destruction will not come near you
Isa  See they may be moved to war but not by my authority all those who come together to make an attack on you will be broken against you
Isa  See I have made the ironworker blowing on the burning coals and making the instrument of war by his work and I have made the waster for destruction
Isa  No instrument of war which is formed against you will be of any use and every tongue which says evil against you will be judged false This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord and their righteousness comes from me says the Lord
Isa  Ho everyone in need come to the waters and he who has no strength let him get food come get bread without money wine and milk without price
Isa  Why do you give your money for what is not bread and the fruit of your work for what will not give you pleasure Give ear to me so that your food may be good and you may have the best in full measure
Isa  Give ear and come to me take note with care so that your souls may have life and I will make an eternal agreement with you even the certain mercies of David
Isa  See I have given him as a witness to the peoples a ruler and a guide to the nations
Isa  See you will send for a nation of which you had no knowledge and those who had no knowledge of you will come running to you because of the Lord your God and because of the Holy One of Israel for he has given you glory
Isa  Make search for the Lord while he is there make prayer to him while he is near
Isa  Let the sinner give up his way and the evildoer his purpose and let him come back to the Lord and he will have mercy on him and to our God for there is full forgiveness with him
Isa  For my thoughts are not your thoughts or your ways my ways says the Lord
Isa  For as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
Isa  For as the rain comes down and the snow from heaven and does not go back again but gives water to the earth and makes it fertile giving seed to the planter and bread for food
Isa  So will my word be which goes out of my mouth it will not come back to me with nothing done but it will give effect to my purpose and do that for which I have sent it
Isa  For you will go out with joy and be guided in peace the mountains and the hills will make melody before you and all the trees of the fields will make sounds of joy
Isa  In place of the thorn will come up the firtree and in place of the blackberry the myrtle and it will be to the Lord for a name for an eternal sign which will not be cut off
Isa  The Lord says Let your way of life be upright and let your behaviour be rightly ordered for my salvation is near and my righteousness will quickly be seen
Isa  Happy is the man who does this and the son of man whose behaviour is so ordered who keeps the Sabbath holy and his hand from doing any evil
Isa  And let not the man from a strange country who has been joined to the Lord say The Lord will certainly put a division between me and his people and let not the unsexed man say See I am a dry tree
Isa  For the Lord says As for the unsexed who keep my Sabbaths and give their hearts to pleasing me and keep their agreement with me
Isa  I will give to them in my house and inside my walls a place and a name better than that of sons and daughters I will give them an eternal name which will not be cut off
Isa  And as for those from a strange country who are joined to the Lord to give worship to him and honour to his name to be his servants even everyone who keeps the Sabbath holy and keeps his agreement with me
Isa  I will make them come to my holy mountain and will give them joy in my house of prayer I will take pleasure in the burned offerings which they make on my altar for my house will be named a house of prayer for all peoples
Isa  The Lord God who gets together the wandering ones of Israel says I will get together others in addition to those of Israel who have come back
Isa  All you beasts of the field come together for your meat even all you beasts of the wood
Isa  His watchmen are blind they are all without knowledge they are all dogs without tongues unable to make a sound stretched out dreaming loving sleep
Isa  Yes the dogs are for ever looking for food while these the keepers of the sheep are without wisdom they have all gone after their pleasure every one looking for profit they are all the same
Isa  Come they say I will get wine and we will take strong drink in full measure and tomorrow will be like today full of pleasure
Isa  The upright man goes to his death and no one gives a thought to it and godfearing men are taken away and no one is troubled by it for the upright man is taken away because of evildoing and goes into peace
Isa  They are at rest in their last restingplaces every one going straight before him
Isa  But come near you sons of her who is wise in secret arts the seed of her who is false to her husband and of the loose woman
Isa  Of whom do you make sport against whom is your mouth open wide and your tongue put out are you not uncontrolled children a false seed
Isa  You who are burning with evil desire among the oaks under every green tree putting children to death in the valleys under the cracks of the rocks
Isa  Among the smooth stones of the valley is your heritage they even they are your part even to them have you made a drink offering and a meal offering Is it possible for such things to be overlooked by me
Isa  You have put your bed on a high mountain there you went up to make your offering
Isa  And on the back of the doors and on the pillars you have put your sign for you have been false to me with another you have made your bed wide and made an agreement with them you had a desire for their bed where you saw it
Isa  And you went to Melech with oil and much perfume and you sent your representatives far off and went as low as the underworld
Isa  You were tired with your long journeys but you did not say There is no hope you got new strength and so you were not feeble
Isa  And of whom were you in fear so that you were false and did not keep me in mind or give thought to it Have I not been quiet keeping myself secret and so you were not in fear of me
Isa  I will make clear what your righteousness is like and your works you will have no profit in them
Isa  Your false gods will not keep you safe in answer to your cry but the wind will take them they will be gone like a breath but he who puts his hope in me will take the land and will have my holy mountain as his heritage
Isa  And I will say Make it high make it high get ready the way take the stones out of the way of my people
Isa  For this is the word of him who is high and lifted up whose restingplace is eternal whose name is Holy my restingplace is in the high and holy place and with him who is crushed and poor in spirit to give life to the spirit of the poor and to make strong the heart of the crushed
Isa  For I will not give punishment for ever or be angry without end for from me breath goes out and I it was who made the souls
Isa  I was quickly angry with his evil ways and sent punishment on him veiling my face in wrath and he went on turning his heart from me
Isa  I have seen his ways and I will make him well I will give him rest comforting him and his people who are sad
Isa  I will give the fruit of the lips Peace peace to him who is near and to him who is far off says the Lord and I will make him well
Isa  But the evildoers are like the troubled sea for which there is no rest and its waters send up earth and waste
Isa  There is no peace says my God for the evildoers
Isa  Make a loud cry do not be quiet let your voice be sounding like a horn and make clear to my people their evil doings and to the family of Jacob their sins
Isa  Though they make prayer to me every day and take pleasure in the knowledge of my ways like a nation which has done righteousness and has not given up the rules of their God they make requests to me for the right orders it is their delight to come near to God
Isa  They say Why have we kept ourselves from food and you do not see it why have we kept ourselves from pleasure and you take no note of it If in the days when you keep from food you take the chance to do your business and get in your debts
Isa  If keeping from food makes you quickly angry ready for fighting and giving blows with evil hands your holy days are not such as to make your voice come to my ears on high
Isa  Have I given orders for such a day as this a day for keeping yourselves from pleasure is it only a question of the bent head of putting on haircloth and being seated in the dust is this what seems to you a holy day wellpleasing to the Lord
Isa  Is not this the holy day for which I have given orders to let loose those who have wrongly been made prisoners to undo the bands of the yoke and to let the crushed go free and every yoke be broken
Isa  Is it not to give your bread to those in need and to let the poor who have no restingplace come into your house to put a robe on the unclothed one when you see him and not to keep your eyes shut for fear of seeing his flesh
Isa  Then will light be shining on you like the morning and your wounds will quickly be well and your righteousness will go before you and the glory of the Lord will come after you
Isa  Then at the sound of your voice the Lord will give an answer at your cry he will say Here am I If you take away from among you the yoke the putting out of the finger of shame and the evil word
Isa  And if you give your bread to those in need of it so that the troubled one may have his desire then you will have light in the dark and your night will be as the full light of the sun
Isa  And the Lord will be your guide at all times in dry places he will give you water in full measure and will make strong your bones and you will be like a watered garden and like an everflowing spring
Isa  And your sons will be building again the old waste places you will make strong the bases of old generations and you will be named He who puts up the broken walls and He who makes ready the ways for use
Isa  If you keep the Sabbath with care not doing your business on my holy day and if the Sabbath seems to you a delight and the new moon of the Lord a thing to be honoured and if you give respect to him by not doing your business or going after your pleasure or saying unholy words
Isa  Then the Lord will be your delight and I will put you on the high places of the earth and I will give you the heritage of Jacob your father for the mouth of the Lord has said it
Isa  Truly the Lords hand has not become short so that he is unable to give salvation and his ear is not shut from hearing
Isa  But your sins have come between you and your God and by your evil doings his face has been veiled from you so that he will give you no answer
Isa  For your hands are unclean with blood and your fingers with sin your lips have said false things and your tongue gives out deceit
Isa  No one puts forward an upright cause or gives a true decision their hope is in deceit and their words are false they are with child with sin and give birth to evil
Isa  They give birth to snakes eggs and make spiders threads whoever takes their eggs for food comes to his death and the egg which is crushed becomes a poisonsnake
Isa  Their twisted threads will not make clothing and their works will give them nothing for covering themselves their works are works of sin and violent acts are in their hands
Isa  Their feet go quickly to evil and they take delight in the death of the upright their thoughts are thoughts of sin wasting and destruction are in their ways
Isa  They have no knowledge of the way of peace and there is no sense of what is right in their behaviour they have made for themselves ways which are not straight whoever goes in them has no knowledge of peace
Isa  For this cause our right is far from us and righteousness does not overtake us we are looking for light but there is only the dark for the shining of the sun but our way is in the night
Isa  We go on our way like blind men feeling for the wall even like those who have no eyes we are running against things in daylight as if it was evening our place is in the dark like dead men
Isa  We make noises of grief like bears and sad sounds like doves we are looking for our right but it is not there for salvation but it is far from us
Isa  For our evil doings are increased before you and our sins give witness against us for our evil doings are with us and we have knowledge of our sins
Isa  We have gone against the Lord and been false to him turning away from our God our words have been uncontrolled and in our hearts are thoughts of deceit
Isa  And the right is turned back and righteousness is far away for good faith is not to be seen in the public places and upright behaviour may not come into the town
Isa  Yes faith is gone and he whose heart is turned from evil comes into the power of the cruel and the Lord saw it and he was angry that there was no one to take up their cause
Isa  And he saw that there was no man and was surprised that there was no one to take up their cause so his arm gave salvation and he made righteousness his support
Isa  Yes he put on righteousness as a breastplate and salvation as a headdress and he put on punishment as clothing and wrath as a robe
Isa  He will give them the right reward of their doings wrath to his attackers punishment to his haters and even on the sealands he will send punishment
Isa  So they will see the name of the Lord from the west and his glory from the east for he will come like a rushing stream forced on by a wind of the Lord
Isa  And as a saviour he will come to Zion turning away sin from Jacob says the Lord
Isa  And as for me this is my agreement with them says the Lord my spirit which is on you and my words which I have put in your mouth will not go away from your mouth or from the mouth of your seed or from the mouth of your seeds seed says the Lord from now and for ever
Isa  Up let your face be bright for your light has come and the glory of the Lord is shining on you
Isa  For truly the earth will be dark and the peoples veiled in blackest night but the Lord will be shining on you and his glory will be seen among you
Isa  And nations will come to your light and kings to your bright dawn
Isa  Let your eyes be lifted up and see they are all coming together to you your sons will come from far and your daughters taken with loving care
Isa  Then you will see and be bright with joy and your heart will be shaking with increase of delight for the produce of the sea will be turned to you the wealth of the nations will come to you
Isa  You will be full of cameltrains even the young camels of Midian and Ephah all from Sheba will come with gold and spices giving word of the great acts of the Lord
Isa  All the flocks of Kedar will come together to you the sheep of Nebaioth will be ready for your need they will be pleasing offerings on my altar and my house of prayer will be beautiful
Isa  Who are these coming like a cloud like a flight of doves to their windows
Isa  Vessels of the sealands are waiting for me and the ships of Tarshish first so that your sons may come from far and their silver and gold with them to the place of the name of the Lord your God and to the Holy One of Israel because he has made you beautiful
Isa  And men from strange countries will be building up your walls and their kings will be your servants for in my wrath I sent punishment on you but in my grace I have had mercy on you
Isa  Your doors will be open at all times they will not be shut day or night so that men may come into you with the wealth of the nations with their kings at their head
Isa  For the nation or kingdom which will not be your servant will come to destruction such nations will be completely waste
Isa  The glory of Lebanon will come to you the cypress the plane and the sherbintree together to make my holy place beautiful and the restingplace of my feet will be full of glory
Isa  And the sons of those who were cruel to you will come before you with bent heads and those who made sport of you will go down on their faces at your feet and you will be named The Town of the Lord The Zion of the Holy One of Israel
Isa  And though you were turned away from and hated and had no helper I will make you a pride for ever a joy from generation to generation
Isa  And you will take the milk of the nations flowing from the breast of kings and you will see that I the Lord am your saviour and he who takes up your cause the Strong One of Jacob
Isa  In place of brass I will give gold and for iron silver and for wood brass and for stones iron and I will make Peace your judge and Righteousness your overseer
Isa  Violent acts will no longer be seen in your land wasting or destruction in your limits but your walls will be named Salvation and your doors Praise
Isa  The sun will not be your light by day and the moon will no longer be bright for you by night but the Lord will be to you an eternal light and your God your glory
Isa  Your sun will never again go down or your moon keep back her light for the Lord will be your eternal light and the days of your sorrow will be ended
Isa  Your people will all be upright the land will be their heritage for ever the branch of my planting the work of my hands to be for my glory
Isa  The smallest of their families will become a thousand and a small one a strong nation I the Lord will make it come quickly in its time
Isa  The spirit of the Lord is on me because I am marked out by him to give good news to the poor he has sent me to make the brokenhearted well to say that the prisoners will be made free and that those in chains will see the light again
Isa  To give knowledge that the year of the Lords good pleasure has come and the day of punishment from our God to give comfort to all who are sad
Isa  To give them a fair headdress in place of dust the oil of joy in place of the clothing of grief praise in place of sorrow so that they may be named trees of righteousness the planting of the Lord and so that he may have glory
Isa  And they will be building again the old broken walls and will make new the old waste places and will put up again the towns which have been waste for long generations
Isa  And men from strange countries will be your herdsmen and those who are not Israelites will be your ploughmen and vinekeepers
Isa  But you will be named the priests of the Lord the servants of our God you will have the wealth of the nations for your food and you will be clothed with their glory
Isa  As they had twice as much grief and marks of shame were their heritage so in their land they will be rewarded twice over and will have eternal joy
Isa  For I the Lord take pleasure in upright judging I will not put up with the violent taking away of right and I will certainly give them their reward and I will make an eternal agreement with them
Isa  And their seed will be noted among the nations and their offspring among the peoples it will be clear to all who see them that they are the seed to which the Lord has given his blessing
Isa  I will be full of joy in the Lord my soul will be glad in my God for he has put on me the clothing of salvation covering me with the robe of righteousness as the husband puts on a fair headdress and the bride makes herself beautiful with jewels
Isa  For as the earth puts out buds and as the garden gives growth to the seeds which are planted in it so the Lord will make righteousness and praise to be flowering before all the nations
Isa  Because of Zion I will not keep quiet and because of Jerusalem I will take no rest till her righteousness goes out like the shining of the sun and her salvation like a burning light
Isa  And the nations will see your righteousness and all kings your glory and you will have a new name given by the mouth of the Lord
Isa  And you will be a fair crown in the hand of the Lord and a kings headdress in the hand of your God
Isa  You will not now be named She who is given up and your land will no longer be named The waste land but you will have the name My pleasure is in her and your land will be named Married for the Lord has pleasure in you and your land will be married
Isa  For as a young man takes a virgin for his wife so will your maker be married to you and as a husband has joy in his bride so will the Lord your God be glad over you
Isa  I have put watchmen on your walls O Jerusalem they will not keep quiet day or night you who are the Lords recorders take no rest
Isa  And give him no rest till he puts Jerusalem in her place to be praised in the earth
Isa  The Lord has taken an oath by his right hand and by the arm of his strength Truly I will no longer give your grain to be food for your haters and men of strange countries will not take the wine for which your work has been done
Isa  But those who have got in the grain will have it for their food and will give praise to the Lord and those who have got in the grapes will take the wine of them in the open places of my holy house
Isa  Go through go through the doors make ready the way of the people let the highway be lifted up let the stones be taken away let a flag be lifted up over the peoples
Isa  The Lord has sent out word to the end of the earth Say to the daughter of Zion See your saviour comes those whom he has made free are with him and those to whom he has given salvation go before him
Isa  And they will be named The holy people Those whose cause has been taken up by the Lord and you will be named Desired A town not given up
Isa  Who is this who comes from Edom with bloodred robes from Bozrah he whose clothing is fair stepping with pride in his great strength I whose glory is in the right strong for salvation
Isa  Why is your clothing red and why are your robes like those of one who is crushing the grapes
Isa  I have been crushing the grapes by myself and of the peoples there was no man with me in my wrath and in my passion they were crushed under my feet and my robes are marked with their lifeblood and all my clothing is red
Isa  For the day of punishment is in my heart and the year for the payment of the price for my people has come
Isa  And I saw that there was no helper and I was wondering that no one gave them support so my arm did the work of salvation and my wrath was my support
Isa  And in my passion the peoples were crushed under my feet and broken in my wrath and I put down their strength to the earth
Isa  I will give news of the mercies of the Lord and his great acts even all the things the Lord has done for us in his great grace to the house of Israel even all he has done for us in his unnumbered mercies
Isa  For he said Truly they are my people children who will not be false so he was their saviour out of all their trouble
Isa  It was no sent one or angel but he himself who was their saviour in his love and in his pity he took up their cause and he took them in his arms caring for them all through the years
Isa  But they went against him causing grief to his holy spirit so he was turned against them and made war on them
Isa  Then the early days came to their minds the days of Moses his servant and they said Where is he who made the keeper of his flock come up from the sea where is he who put his holy spirit among them
Isa  He who made the arm of his glory go at the right hand of Moses by whom the waters were parted before them to make himself an eternal name
Isa  He who made them go through the deep waters like a horse in the waste land
Isa  Like the cattle which go down into the valley they went without falling the spirit of the Lord guiding them so you went before your people to make yourself a great name
Isa  Let your eyes be looking down from heaven from your holy and beautiful house where is your deep feeling the working of your power do not keep back the moving of your pity and your mercies
Isa  For you are our father though Abraham has no knowledge of us and Israel gives no thought to us you O Lord are our father from the earliest days you have taken up our cause
Isa  O Lord why do you send us wandering from your ways making our hearts hard so that we have no fear of you Come back because of your servants the tribes of your heritage
Isa  Why have evil men gone over your holy place so that it has been crushed under the feet of our haters
Isa  We have become as those who were never ruled by you on whom your name was not named
Isa  O let the heavens be broken open and come down so that the mountains may be shaking before you
Isa  As when fire puts the brushwood in flames or as when water is boiling from the heat of the fire to make your name feared by your haters so that the nations may be shaking before you
Isa  While you do acts of power for which we are not looking and which have not come to the ears of men in the past
Isa  The ear has not had news of or the eye seen  any God but you working for the man who is waiting for him
Isa  Will you not have mercy on him who takes pleasure in doing righteousness even on those who keep in mind your ways Truly you were angry and we went on doing evil and sinning against you in the past
Isa  For we have all become like an unclean person and all our good acts are like a dirty robe and we have all become old like a dead leaf and our sins like the wind take us away
Isa  And there is no one who makes prayer to your name or who is moved to keep true to you for your face is veiled from us and you have given us into the power of our sins
Isa  But now O Lord you are our father we are the earth and you are our maker and we are all the work of your hand
Isa  Be not very angry O Lord and do not keep our sins in mind for ever give ear to our prayer for we are all your people
Isa  Your holy towns have become a waste Zion has become a waste Jerusalem is a mass of broken walls
Isa  Our holy and beautiful house where our fathers gave praise to you is burned with fire and all the things of our desire have come to destruction
Isa  In view of all this will you still do nothing O Lord will you keep quiet and go on increasing our punishment
Isa  I have been ready to give an answer to those who did not make prayer to me I have been offering myself to those who were not searching for me I said Here am I here am I to a nation which gave no respect to my name
Isa  All day my hands have been stretched out to an uncontrolled people who go in an evil way after the purposes of their hearts
Isa  A people who make me angry every day making offerings in gardens and burning perfumes on bricks
Isa  Who are seated in the restingplaces of the dead and by night are in the secret places who take pigs flesh for food and have the liquid of disgusting things in their vessels
Isa  Who say Keep away do not come near me for fear that I make you holy these are a smoke in my nose a fire burning all day
Isa  See it is recorded before me says the Lord I will not keep back my hand till I have sent punishment
Isa  For their sins and the sins of their fathers who were burning perfumes on the mountains and saying evil things against me on the hills so I will take the measure of their sins and will send the punishment for them into their breast
Isa  This is the word of the Lord As the new wine is seen in the grapes and they say Do not send destruction on it for a blessing is in it so will I do for my servants in order that I may not put an end to them all
Isa  And I will take a seed out of Jacob and out of Judah one who will have my mountains for a heritage and the people I have taken to be mine will have it for themselves and my servants will have their restingplace there
Isa  And Sharon will be a grassland for the flocks and the valley of Achor a restingplace for the herds for my people whose hearts have been turned back to me
Isa  But as for you who have given up the Lord who have no care for my holy mountain who get ready a table for Chance and make offerings of mixed wine to Fate
Isa  Your fate will be the sword and you will all go down to death because when my voice came to you you made no answer you did not give ear to my word but you did what was evil in my eyes desiring what was not pleasing to me
Isa  For this cause says the Lord God My servants will have food but you will be in need of food my servants will have drink but you will be dry my servants will have joy but you will be shamed
Isa  My servants will make songs in the joy of their hearts but you will be crying for sorrow and making sounds of grief from a broken spirit
Isa  And your name will become a curse to my people and the Lord God will put you to death and give his servants another name
Isa  So that he who is requesting a blessing will make use of the name of the true God and he who takes an oath will do so by the true God because the past troubles are gone out of mind and because they are covered from my eyes
Isa  For see I am making a new heaven and a new earth and the past things will be gone completely out of mind
Isa  But men will be glad and have joy for ever in what I am making for I am making Jerusalem a delight and her people a joy
Isa  And I will be glad over Jerusalem and have joy in my people and the voice of weeping will no longer be sounding in her or the voice of grief
Isa  No longer will there be there a child whose days are cut short or an old man whose days have not come to their full measure for the young man at his death will be a hundred years old and he whose life is shorter than a hundred years will seem as one cursed
Isa  And they will be building houses and living in them planting vinegardens and getting the fruit of them
Isa  They will no longer be building for the use of others or planting for others to have the fruit for the days of my people will be like the days of a tree and my loved ones will have joy in full measure in the work of their hands
Isa  Their work will not be for nothing and they will not give birth to children for destruction for they are a seed to whom the Lord has given his blessing and their offspring will be with them
Isa  And before they make their request I will give an answer and while they are still making prayer to me I will give ear
Isa  The wolf and the lamb will take their food together and the lion will make a meal of grass like the ox but dust will be the snakes food There will be no cause of pain or destruction in all my holy mountain says the Lord
Isa  The Lord says Heaven is the seat of my power and earth is the restingplace for my feet what sort of house will you make for me and what place will be my restingplace
Isa  For all these things my hand has made and they are mine says the Lord but to this man only will I give attention to him who is poor and broken in spirit fearing my word
Isa  He who puts an ox to death puts a man to death he who makes an offering of a lamb puts a dog to death he who makes a meal offering makes an offering of pigs blood he who makes an offering of perfumes for a sign gives worship to an image as they have gone after their desires and their soul takes pleasure in their disgusting things
Isa  So I will go after trouble for them and will send on them what they are fearing because no one made answer to my voice or gave ear to my word but they did what was evil in my eyes going after that in which I took no pleasure
Isa  Give ear to the word of the Lord you who are in fear at his word your countrymen hating you and driving you out because of my name have said Let the Lords glory be made clear so that we may see your joy but they will be put to shame
Isa  There is a noise of war from the town a sound from the Temple the voice of the Lord giving punishment to his haters
Isa  Before her pains came she gave birth before her pains she gave birth to a manchild
Isa  When has such a story come to mens ears who has seen such things will a land come to birth in one day will a nation be given birth in a minute For when Zions pains came on her she gave birth to her children straight away
Isa  Will I by whom the birth was started not make it complete says the Lord Will I who make children come to birth let them be kept back says your God
Isa  Have joy with Jerusalem and be glad with her all you her lovers take part in her joy all you who are sorrowing for her
Isa  So that you may take of the comfort flowing from her breasts and be delighted with the full measure of her glory
Isa  For the Lord says See I will make her peace like a river and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream and she will take her children in her arms gently caring for them on her knees
Isa  As to one who is comforted by his mother so will I give you comfort and you will be comforted in Jerusalem
Isa  And you will see it and your heart will be glad and your bones will get new strength like young grass and the hand of the Lord will be seen at work for his servants and his wrath against his haters
Isa  For the Lord is coming with fire and his warcarriages will be like the stormwind to give punishment in the heat of his wrath and his passion is like flames of fire
Isa  For with fire and sword will the Lord come judging all the earth and his sword will be on all flesh and great numbers will be put to death by him
Isa  As for those who keep themselves separate and make themselves clean in the gardens going after one in the middle taking pigs flesh for food and other disgusting things such as the mouse their works and their thoughts will come to an end together says the Lord
Isa  And I am coming to get together all nations and tongues and they will come and will see my glory
Isa  And I will put a sign among them and I will send those who are still living to the nations to Tarshish Put and Lud Meshech and Rosh Tubal and Javan to the sealands far away who have not had word of me or seen my glory and they will give the knowledge of my glory to the nations
Isa  And they will take your countrymen out of all the nations for an offering to the Lord on horses and in carriages and in carts and on asses and on camels to my holy mountain Jerusalem says the Lord as the children of Israel take their offering in a clean vessel into the house of the Lord
Isa  And some of them will I take for priests and Levites says the Lord
Isa  For as the new heaven and the new earth which I will make will be for ever before me says the Lord so will your seed and your name be for ever
Isa  And it will be that from new moon to new moon and from Sabbath to Sabbath all flesh will come to give worship before me says the Lord
Isa  And they will go out to see the dead bodies of the men who have done evil against me for their worm will ever be living and their fire will never be put out and they will be a thing of fear to all flesh
Jer  The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin
Jer  To whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah in the thirteenth year of his rule
Jer  And it came again in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah up to the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah till Jerusalem was taken away in the fifth month
Jer  Now the word of the Lord came to me saying
Jer  Before you were formed in the body of your mother I had knowledge of you and before your birth I made you holy I have given you the work of being a prophet to the nations
Jer  Then said I O Lord God see I have no power of words for I am a child
Jer  But the Lord said to me Do not say I am a child for wherever I send you you are to go and whatever I give you orders to say you are to say
Jer  Have no fear because of them for I am with you to keep you safe says the Lord
Jer  Then the Lord put out his hand touching my mouth and the Lord said to me See I have put my words in your mouth
Jer  See this day I have put you over the nations and over the kingdoms for uprooting and smashing down for destruction and overturning for building up and planting
Jer  Again the word of the Lord came to me saying Jeremiah what do you see And I said I see a branch of an almondtree
Jer  Then the Lord said to me You have seen well for I keep watch over my word to give effect to it
Jer  And the word of the Lord came to me a second time saying What do you see And I said I see a boiling pot and its face is from the north
Jer  Then the Lord said to me Out of the north evil will come bursting out on all the people of the land
Jer  For see I will send for all the families of the kingdoms of the north says the Lord and they will come everyone placing his high seat at the way into Jerusalem and against its walls on every side and against all the towns of Judah
Jer  And I will give my decision against them on account of all their evildoing because they have given me up burning perfumes to other gods and worshipping the works of their hands
Jer  So make yourself ready and go and say to them everything I give you orders to say do not be overcome by fear of them or I will send fear on you before them
Jer  For see this day have I made you a walled town and an iron pillar and walls of brass against all the land against the kings of Judah against its captains against its priests and against the people of the land
Jer  They will be fighting against you but they will not overcome you for I am with you says the Lord to give you salvation
Jer  And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Jer  Go and say in the ears of Jerusalem The Lord says I still keep the memory of your kind heart when you were young and your love when you became my bride how you went after me in the waste of sand in an unplanted land
Jer  Israel was holy to the Lord the firstfruits of his increase all who made attacks on him were judged as wrongdoers evil came on them says the Lord
Jer  Give ear to the words of the Lord O sons of Jacob and all the families of Israel
Jer  These are the words of the Lord What evil have your fathers seen in me that they have gone far from me and walking after what is false have become false
Jer  And they never said Where is the Lord who took us up out of the land of Egypt who was our guide through the waste of sand through an unplanted land full of deep holes through a dry land of deep shade which no one went through and where no man was living
Jer  And I took you into a fertile land where you were living on its fruit and its wealth but when you came in you made my land unclean and made my heritage a disgusting thing
Jer  The priests did not say Where is the Lord and those who were expert in the law had no knowledge of me and the rulers did evil against me and the prophets became prophets of the Baal going after things without value
Jer  For this reason I will again put forward my cause against you says the Lord even against you and against your childrens children
Jer  For go over to the sealands of Kittim and see send to Kedar and give deep thought to it and see if there has ever been such a thing
Jer  Has any nation ever made a change in their gods though they are no gods but my people have given up their glory in exchange for what is of no profit

Jer  The evil you yourselves have done will be your punishment your errors will be your judge be certain then and see that it is an evil and a bitter thing to give up the Lord your God and no longer to be moved by fear of me says the Lord the Lord of armies
Jer  For in the past your yoke was broken by your hands and your cords parted and you said I will not be your servant for on every high hill and under every branching tree your behaviour was like that of a loose woman
Jer  But when you were planted by me you were a noble vine in every way a true seed how then have you been changed into the branching plant of a strange vine
Jer  For even if you are washed with soda and take much soap still your evildoing is marked before me says the Lord God
Jer  How are you able to say I am not unclean I have not gone after the Baals see your way in the valley be clear about what you have done you are a quickfooted camel twisting her way in and out

Jer  With what care are your ways ordered when you are looking for love so  your ways

Jer  Will he be angry for ever will he keep his wrath to the end These things you have said and have done evil and have had your way
Jer  And the Lord said to me in the days of Josiah the king Have you seen what Israel turning away from me has done She has gone up on every high mountain and under every branching tree acting like a loose woman there
Jer  And I said After she has done all these things she will come back to me but she did not And her false sister Judah saw it
Jer  And though she saw that because Israel turning away from me had been untrue to me I had put her away and given her a statement in writing ending the relation between us still Judah her false sister had no fear but went and did the same
Jer  So that through all her loose behaviour the land became unclean and she was untrue giving herself to stones and trees
Jer  But for all this her false sister Judah has not come back to me with all her heart but with deceit says the Lord
Jer  And the Lord said to me Israel in her turning away is seen to be more upright than false Judah

Jer  At that time Jerusalem will be named the seat of the Lords kingdom and all the nations will come together to it to the name of the Lord to Jerusalem and no longer will their steps be guided by the purposes of their evil hearts
Jer  In those days the family of Judah will go with the family of Israel and they will come together out of the land of the north into the land which I gave for a heritage to your fathers
Jer  But I said How am I to put you among the children and give you a desired land a heritage of glory among the armies of the nations and I said You are to say to me My father and not be turned away from me
Jer  Truly as a wife is false to her husband so have you been false to me O Israel says the Lord
Jer  A voice is sounding on the open hilltops the weeping and the prayers of the children of Israel because their way is twisted they have not kept the Lord their God in mind

Jer  Truly the hills and the noise of an army on the mountains are a false hope truly in the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel
Jer  But the Baal has taken all the work of our fathers from our earliest days their flocks and their herds their sons and their daughters

Jer  A lion has gone up from his secret place in the woods and one who makes waste the nations is on his way he has gone out from his place to make your land unpeopled so that your towns will be made waste with no man living in them
Jer  For this put on haircloth with weeping and loud crying for the burning wrath of the Lord is not turned back from us
Jer  And it will come about in that day says the Lord that the heart of the king will be dead in him and the hearts of the rulers and the priests will be overcome with fear and the prophets with wonder
Jer  Then said I Ah Lord God your words were not true when you said to this people and to Jerusalem You will have peace when the sword has come even to the soul
Jer  At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem A burning wind from the open hilltops in the waste land is blowing on the daughter of my people not for separating or cleaning the grain
Jer  A full wind will come for me and now I will give my decision against them
Jer  See he will come up like the clouds and his warcarriages like the stormwind his horses are quicker than eagles Sorrow is ours for destruction has come on us
Jer  O Jerusalem make your heart clean from evil so that you may have salvation How long are evil purposes to have a restingplace in you

Jer  Like keepers of a field they are against her on every side because she has been fighting against me says the Lord
Jer  Your ways and your doings have made these things come on you this is your sin truly it is bitter going deep into your heart
Jer  My soul my soul I am pained to my inmost heart my heart is troubled in me I am not able to be quiet because the sound of the horn the note of war has come to my ears
Jer  News is given of destruction on destruction all the land is made waste suddenly my tents straight away my curtains are made waste
Jer  How long will I go on seeing the flag and hearing the sound of the warhorn
Jer  For my people are foolish they have no knowledge of me they are evilminded children without sense all of them they are wise in evildoing but have no knowledge of doing good
Jer  Looking at the earth I saw that it was waste and without form and to the heavens that they had no light
Jer  Looking at the mountains I saw them shaking and all the hills were moved about
Jer  Looking I saw that there was no man and all the birds of heaven had gone in flight
Jer  Looking I saw that the fertile field was a waste and all its towns were broken down before the Lord and before his burning wrath
Jer  For this is what the Lord has said All the land will become a waste I will make destruction complete
Jer  The earth will be weeping for this and the heavens on high will be black because I have said it and I will not go back from it it is my purpose and it will not be changed
Jer  All the land is in flight because of the noise of the horsemen and the bowmen they have taken cover in the woodland and up on the rocks every town has been given up not a man is living in them
Jer  And you when you are made waste what will you do Though you are clothed in red though you make yourself beautiful with ornaments of gold though you make your eyes wide with paint it is for nothing that you make yourself fair your lovers have no more desire for you they have designs on your life
Jer  A voice has come to my ears like the voice of a woman in birthpains the pain of one giving birth to her first child the voice of the daughter of Zion fighting for breath stretching out her hands saying Now sorrow is mine for my strength is gone from me before the takers of life
Jer  Go quickly through the streets of Jerusalem and see now and get knowledge and make a search in her wide places if there is a man if there is one in her who is upright who keeps faith and she will have my forgiveness
Jer  And though they say By the living Lord truly their oaths are false
Jer  O Lord do not your eyes see good faith you have given them punishment but they were not troubled you have sent destruction on them but they did not take your teaching to heart they have made their faces harder than a rock they would not come back
Jer  Then I said But these are the poor they are foolish for they have no knowledge of the way of the Lord or of the behaviour desired by their God
Jer  I will go to the great men and have talk with them for they have knowledge of the way of the Lord and of the behaviour desired by their God But as for these their one purpose is a broken yoke and burst bands
Jer  And so a lion from the woods will put them to death a wolf of the waste land will make them waste a leopard will keep watch on their towns and everyone who goes out from them will be food for the beasts because of the great number of their sins and the increase of their wrongdoing
Jer  How is it possible for you to have my forgiveness for this your children have given me up taking their oaths by those who are no gods when I had given them food in full measure they were false to their wives taking their pleasure in the houses of loose women
Jer  They were full of desire like horses after a meal of grain everyone went after his neighbours wife
Jer  Am I not to give punishment for these things says the Lord will not my soul take payment from such a nation as this
Jer  Go up against her vines and make waste let the destruction be complete take away her branches for they are not the Lords
Jer  For the people of Israel and the people of Judah have been very false to me says the Lord
Jer  They would have nothing to do with the Lord saying He will do nothing and no evil will come to us we will not see the sword or be short of food
Jer  And the prophets will become wind and the word is not in them so it will be done to them
Jer  For this reason the Lord the God of armies has said Because you have said this I will make my words in your mouth a fire and this people wood and they will be burned up by it
Jer  See I will send you a nation from far away O people of Israel says the Lord a strong nation and an old nation a nation whose language is strange to you so that you may not get the sense of their words
Jer  Their arrows give certain death they are all men of war
Jer  They will take all the produce of your fields which would have been food for your sons and your daughters they will take your flocks and your herds they will take all your vines and your figtrees and with the sword they will make waste your walled towns in which you put your faith
Jer  But even in those days says the Lord I will not let your destruction be complete
Jer  And it will come about when you say Why has the Lord our God done all these things to us that you will say to them As you gave me up making yourselves servants to strange gods in your land so will you be servants to strange men in a land which is not yours
Jer  Say this openly in Jacob and give it out in Judah saying
Jer  Give ear now to this O foolish people without sense who have eyes but see nothing and ears without the power of hearing
Jer  Have you no fear of me says the Lord will you not be shaking with fear before me who have put the sand as a limit for the sea by an eternal order so that it may not go past it and though it is ever in motion it is not able to have its way though the sound of its waves is loud they are not able to go past it
Jer  But the heart of this people is uncontrolled and turned away from me they are broken loose and gone
Jer  And they do not say in their hearts Now let us give worship to our God who gives the rain the winter and the spring rain at the right time who keeps for us the ordered weeks of the graincutting
Jer  Through your evildoing these things have been turned away and your sins have kept back good from you
Jer  For there are sinners among my people they keep watch like men watching for birds they put a net and take men in it
Jer  As the fowlhouse is full of birds so are their houses full of deceit for this reason they have become great and have got wealth
Jer  They have become fat and strong they have gone far in works of evil they give no support to the cause of the child without a father so that they may do well they do not see that the poor man gets his rights
Jer  Am I not to give punishment for these things says the Lord will not my soul take payment from such a nation as this
Jer  A thing of wonder and fear has come about in the land
Jer  The prophets give false words and the priests give decisions by their direction and my people are glad to have it so and what will you do in the end
Jer  Go in flight out of Jerusalem so that you may be safe you children of Benjamin and let the horn be sounded in Tekoa and the flag be lifted up on Bethhaccherem for evil is looking out from the north and a great destruction
Jer  The fair and delicate one the daughter of Zion will be cut off by my hand
Jer  Keepers of sheep with their flocks will come to her they will put up their tents round her everyone will get food in his place
Jer  Make war ready against her up let us go up when the sun is high Sorrow is ours for the day is turned and the shades of evening are stretched out
Jer  Up let us go up by night and send destruction on her great houses
Jer  For this is what the Lord of armies has said Let trees be cut down and an earthwork be placed against Jerusalem sorrow on the false town inside her there is nothing but cruel ways
Jer  As the spring keeps its waters cold so she keeps her evil in her the sound of cruel and violent behaviour is in her before me at all times are disease and wounds
Jer  Undergo teaching O Jerusalem or my soul will be turned away from you and I will make you a waste an unpeopled land
Jer  This is what the Lord of armies has said Everything will be taken from the rest of Israel as the last grapes are taken from the vine let your hand be turned to the small branches like one pulling off grapes
Jer  To whom am I to give word witnessing so that they may take note see their ears are stopped and they are not able to give attention see the word of the Lord has been a cause of shame to them they have no delight in it
Jer  For this reason I am full of the wrath of the Lord I am tired of keeping it in may it be let loose on the children in the street and on the band of the young men together for even the husband with his wife will be taken the old man with him who is full of days
Jer  And their houses will be handed over to others their fields and their wives together for my hand will be stretched out against the people of the land says the Lord
Jer  For from the least of them even to the greatest everyone is given up to getting money from the prophet even to the priest everyone is working deceit
Jer  And they have made little of the wounds of my people saying Peace peace when there is no peace
Jer  Let them be put to shame because they have done disgusting things They had no shame they were not able to become red with shame so they will come down with those who are falling when my punishment comes on them they will be made low says the Lord
Jer  This is what the Lord has said Take your place looking out on the ways make search for the old roads saying Where is the good way and go in it that you may have rest for your souls But they said We will not go in it
Jer  And I put watchmen over you saying Give attention to the sound of the horn but they said We will not give attention
Jer  So then give ear you nations and 
Jer  Give ear O earth see I will make evil come on this people even the fruit of their thoughts because they have not given attention to my words and they would have nothing to do with my law
Jer  To what purpose does sweet perfume come to me from Sheba and spices from a far country your burned offerings give me no pleasure your offerings of beasts are not pleasing to me
Jer  For this reason the Lord has said See I will put stones in the way of this people and the fathers and the sons together will go falling over them the neighbour and his friend will come to destruction
Jer  The Lord has said See a people is coming from the north country a great nation will be put in motion from the inmost parts of the earth
Jer  Bows and spears are in their hands they are cruel and have no mercy their voice is like the thunder of the sea and they go on horses everyone in his place like men going to the fight against you O daughter of Zion
Jer  The news of it has come to our ears our hands have become feeble trouble has come on us and pain like the pain of a woman in childbirth
Jer  Go not out into the field or by the way for there is the sword of the attacker and fear on every side
Jer  O daughter of my people put on haircloth rolling yourself in the dust give yourself to sorrow as for an only son with most bitter cries of grief for he who makes waste will come on us suddenly
Jer  I have made you a tester among my people so that you may have knowledge of their way and put it to the test
Jer  All of them are turned away going about with false stories they are brass and iron they are all workers of deceit
Jer  The blower is blowing strongly the lead is burned away in the fire they go on heating the metal to no purpose for the evildoers are not taken away
Jer  They will be named waste silver because the Lord has given them up
Jer  The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying
Jer  Take your place in the doorway of the Lords house and give out this word there and say Give ear to the word of the Lord all you of Judah who come inside these doors to give worship to the Lord
Jer  The Lord of armies the God of Israel says Let your ways and your doings be changed for the better and I will let you go on living in this place
Jer  Put no faith in false words saying The Temple of the Lord the Temple of the Lord the Temple of the Lord are these
Jer  For if your ways and your doings are truly changed for the better if you truly give right decisions between a man and his neighbour
Jer  If you are not cruel to the man from a strange country and to the child without a father and to the widow and do not put the upright to death in this place or go after other gods causing damage to yourselves
Jer  Then I will let you go on living in this place in the land which I gave to your fathers in the past and for ever
Jer  See you put your faith in false words which are of no profit
Jer  Will you take the goods of others put men to death and be untrue to your wives and take false oaths and have perfumes burned to the Baal and go after other gods which are strange to you
Jer  And come and take your place before me in this house which is named by my name and say We have been made safe so that you may do all these disgusting things
Jer  Has this house which is named by my name become a hole of thieves to you Truly I even I have seen it says the Lord
Jer  But go now to my place which was in Shiloh where I put my name at first and see what I did to it because of the evildoing of my people Israel
Jer  And now because you have done all these works says the Lord and I sent my word to you getting up early and sending but you did not give ear and my voice came to you but you gave no answer
Jer  For this reason I will do to the house which is named by my name and in which you have put your faith and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers as I have done to Shiloh
Jer  And I will send you away from before my face as I have sent away all your brothers even all the seed of Ephraim
Jer  And as for you Jeremiah make no prayers for this people send up no cry or prayer for them make no request for them to me for I will not give ear
Jer  Do you not see what they are doing in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem
Jer  The children go for wood the fathers get the fire burning the women are working the paste to make cakes for the queen of heaven and drink offerings are drained out to other gods moving me to wrath
Jer  Are they moving me to wrath says the Lord are they not moving themselves to their shame
Jer  So this is what the Lord God has said See my wrath and my passion will be let loose on this place on man and beast and on the trees of the field and on the produce of the earth it will be burning and will not be put out
Jer  These are the words of the Lord of armies the God of Israel Put your burned offerings with your offerings of beasts and take flesh for your food
Jer  For I said nothing to your fathers and gave them no orders on the day when I took them out of Egypt about burned offerings or offerings of beasts
Jer  But this was the order I gave them saying Give ear to my voice and I will be your God and you will be my people go in all the way ordered by me so that all may be well for you
Jer  But they took no note and did not give ear but were guided by the thoughts and the pride of their evil hearts going back and not forward
Jer  From the day when your fathers came out of Egypt till this day I have sent my servants the prophets to you getting up early every day and sending them
Jer  But still they took no note and would not give ear but they made their necks stiff doing worse than their fathers
Jer  And you are to say all these words to them but they will not give ear to you you will send out your voice to them but they will give no answer
Jer  And you are to say to them This is the nation which has not given ear to the voice of their God or taken his teaching to heart good faith is dead and is cut off from their mouths
Jer  Let your hair be cut off O Jerusalem and let it go and let a song of grief go up on the open hilltops for the Lord is turned away from the generation of his wrath and has given them up
Jer  For the children of Judah have done what is evil in my eyes says the Lord they have put their disgusting images in the house which is named by my name making it unclean
Jer  And they have put up the high place of Topheth in the valley of the son of Hinnom burning their sons and their daughters there in the fire a thing which was not ordered by me and never came into my mind
Jer  For this cause the days are coming says the Lord when it will no longer be named Topheth or The valley of the son of Hinnom but The valley of Death for they will put the dead into the earth in Topheth till there is no more room
Jer  And the bodies of this people will be food for the birds of heaven and for the beasts of the earth and there will be no one to send them away
Jer  And in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem I will put an end to the laughing voices the voice of joy and the voice of the newlymarried man and the voice of the bride for the land will become a waste
Jer  At that time says the Lord they will take the bones of the kings of Judah and the bones of his rulers and the bones of the priests and the bones of the prophets and the bones of the people of Jerusalem out of their restingplaces
Jer  And they will put them out before the sun and the moon and all the stars of heaven whose lovers and servants they have been after whom they have gone to whom they have made prayers and to whom they have given worship they will not be put together or placed in the earth they will be waste on the face of the earth
Jer  And death will be desired more than life by the rest of this evil family who are still living in all the places where I have sent them away says the Lord of armies
Jer  Further you are to say to them This is what the Lord has said Will those who are falling not be lifted up again will he who has gone away not come back
Jer  Why do these people of Jerusalem go back for ever turning away they will not give up their deceit they will not come back
Jer  I took note and gave ear but no one said what is right no man had regret for his evildoing saying What have I done everyone goes off on his way like a horse rushing to the fight
Jer  Truly the stork in the heavens is conscious of her fixed times the dove and the swallow and the crane keep to the times of their coming but my people have no knowledge of the law of the Lord
Jer  How is it that you say We are wise and the law of the Lord is with us But see the false pen of the scribes has made it false
Jer  The wise men are shamed they are overcome with fear and taken see they have given up the word of the Lord and what use is their wisdom to them
Jer  So I will give their wives to others and their fields to those who will take them for themselves for everyone from the least to the greatest is given up to getting money from the priest even to the prophet everyone is false
Jer  And they have made little of the wounds of the daughter of Zion saying Peace peace when there is no peace
Jer  Let them be put to shame because they have done disgusting things They had no shame they were not able to become red with shame so they will come down with those who are falling in the time of their punishment they will be made low says the Lord
Jer  I will put an end to them completely says the Lord there are no grapes on the vine and no figs on the figtree and the leaf is dry
Jer  Why are we seated doing nothing come together and let us go to the walled towns and let destruction overtake us there for the Lord our God has sent destruction on us and given us bitter water for our drink because we have done evil against the Lord
Jer  We were looking for peace but no good came and for a time of wellbeing but there is only a great fear

Jer  See I will send snakes and poisonsnakes among you against which the wonderworker has no power and they will give you wounds which may not be made well says the Lord
Jer  Sorrow has come on me my heart in me is feeble
Jer  The voice of the cry of the daughter of my people comes from a far land Is the Lord not in Zion is not her King in her Why have they made me angry with their images and their strange gods which are no gods
Jer  The graincutting is past the summer is ended and no salvation has come to us
Jer  For the destruction of the daughter of my people I am broken I am dressed in the clothing of grief fear has taken me in its grip
Jer  Is there no lifegiving oil in Gilead is there no expert in medical arts why then have my people not been made well
Jer  If only my head was a stream of waters and my eyes fountains of weeping so that I might go on weeping day and night for the dead of the daughter of my people
Jer  If only I had in the waste land a nights restingplace for travellers so that I might go away far from my people for they are all untrue a band of false men
Jer  Their tongues are bent like a bow to send out false words they have become strong in the land but not for good faith they go on from evil to evil and they have no knowledge of me says the Lord
Jer  Let everyone keep watch on his neighbour and put no faith in any brother for every brother will certainly be tricking his brother and every neighbour will go about saying evil
Jer  Everyone will make sport of his neighbour with deceit not saying what is true their tongues have been trained to say false words they are twisted hating to come back
Jer  There is wrong on wrong deceit on deceit they have given up the knowledge of me says the Lord
Jer  So the Lord of armies has said See I will make them soft in the fire and put them to the test this I will do because of their evildoing
Jer  His tongue is an arrow causing death the words of his mouth are deceit he says words of peace to his neighbour but in his heart he is waiting secretly for him
Jer  Am I not to send punishment for these things says the Lord will not my soul take payment from such a nation as this
Jer  Give yourselves to weeping crying out in sorrow for the mountains and for the fields of the waste land send up a song of grief because they are burned up so that no one goes through there is no sound of cattle the bird of the heavens and the beast are in flight and are gone
Jer  And I will make Jerusalem a mass of broken stones the livingplace of jackals and I will make the towns of Judah a waste with no man living there
Jer  Who is the wise man able to see this who is he to whom the word of the Lord has come so that he may make it clear why is the land given to destruction and burned up like a waste place so that no one goes through
Jer  And the Lord said Because they have given up my law which I put before them giving no attention to my voice and not being guided by it
Jer  But they have been walking in the pride of their hearts going after the Baals as their fathers gave them teaching
Jer  So the Lord of armies the God of Israel has said I will give them even this people bitter plants for food and bitter water for drink
Jer  And I will send them wandering among the nations among people strange to them and to their fathers and I will send the sword after them till I have put an end to them
Jer  This is what the Lord of armies has said Take thought and send for the weeping women so that they may come and send for the wise women so that they may come
Jer  Let them quickly make cries of sorrow for us so that drops may be flowing from our eyes till they are streaming with water
Jer  For a sound of weeping goes up from Zion a cry How has destruction come on us we are overcome with shame because we have gone away from our land he has sent us out from our house
Jer  But even now give ear to the word of the Lord O you women let your ears be open to the word of his mouth training your daughters to give cries of sorrow everyone teaching her neighbour a song of grief
Jer  For death has come up into our windows forcing its way into our great houses cutting off the children in the streets and the young men in the wide places
Jer  The bodies of men will be falling like waste on the open fields and like grain dropped by the graincutter and no one will take them up
Jer  This is the word of the Lord Let not the wise man take pride in his wisdom or the strong man in his strength or the man of wealth in his wealth
Jer  But if any man has pride let it be in this that he has the wisdom to have knowledge of me that I am the Lord working mercy giving true decisions and doing righteousness in the earth for in these things I have delight says the Lord
Jer  See the day is coming says the Lord when I will send punishment on all those who have circumcision in the flesh
Jer  On Egypt and on Judah and on Edom and on the children of Ammon and on Moab and on all who have the ends of their hair cut who are living in the waste land for all these nations and all the people of Israel are without circumcision in their hearts
Jer  Give ear to the word which the Lord says to you O people of Israel
Jer  This is what the Lord has said Do not go in the way of the nations have no fear of the signs of heaven for the nations go in fear of them
Jer  For that which is feared by the people is foolish it is the work of the hands of the workman for a tree is cut down by him out of the woods with his axe
Jer  They make it beautiful with silver and gold they make it strong with nails and hammers so that it may not be moved
Jer  It is like a pillar in a garden of plants and has no voice it has to be lifted for it has no power of walking Have no fear of it for it has no power of doing evil and it is not able to do any good
Jer  There is no one like you O Lord you are great and your name is great in power
Jer  Who would not have fear of you O King of the nations for it is your right for among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms there is no one like you
Jer  But they are together like beasts and foolish the teaching of false gods is wood
Jer  Silver hammered into plates is sent from Tarshish and gold from Uphaz the work of the expert workman and of the hands of the goldworker blue and purple is their clothing all the work of expert men
Jer  But the Lord is the true God he is the living God and an eternal king when he is angry the earth is shaking with fear and the nations give way before his wrath
Jer  This is what you are to say to them The gods who have not made the heavens and the earth will be cut off from the earth and from under the heavens
Jer  He has made the earth by his power he has made the world strong in its place by his wisdom and by his wise design the heavens have been stretched out
Jer  At the sound of his voice there is a massing of waters in the heavens and he makes the mists go up from the ends of the earth he makes the thunderflames for the rain and sends out the wind from his storehouses
Jer  Then every man becomes like a beast without knowledge every goldworker is put to shame by the image he has made for his metal image is deceit and there is no breath in them
Jer  They are nothing a work of error in the time of their punishment destruction will overtake them
Jer  The heritage of Jacob is not like these for the maker of all things is his heritage the Lord of armies is his name
Jer  Get your goods together and go out of the land O you who are shut up in the walled town
Jer  For the Lord has said I will send the people in flight like a stone from the land at this time troubling them so that they will be conscious of it
Jer  Sorrow is mine for I am wounded my wound may not be made well and I said Cruel is my disease I may not be free from it
Jer  My tent is pulled down and all my cords are broken my children have gone from me and they are not no longer is there anyone to give help in stretching out my tent and hanging up my curtains
Jer  For the keepers of the sheep have become like beasts not looking to the Lord for directions so they have not done wisely and all their flocks have been put to flight
Jer  News is going about see it is coming a great shaking is coming from the north country so that the towns of Judah may be made waste and become the livingplace of jackals
Jer  O Lord I am conscious that a mans way is not in himself man has no power of guiding his steps
Jer  O Lord put me right but with wise purpose not in your wrath or you will make me small
Jer  Let your wrath be let loose on the nations which have no knowledge of you and on the families who give no worship to your name for they have made a meal of Jacob truly they have made a meal of him and put an end to him and made his fields a waste
Jer  The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying
Jer  Give ear to the words of this agreement and say to the men of Judah and to the people of Jerusalem
Jer  The Lord the God of Israel has said Let that man be cursed who does not give ear to the words of this agreement
Jer  To the order which I gave your fathers on the day when I took them out of the land of Egypt out of the oven of iron saying Give ear to my voice and do all the orders I have given you so you will be my people and I will be your God
Jer  So that I may give effect to the oath which I made to your fathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honey as at this day And I said in answer So be it O Lord
Jer  And the Lord said to me Give out these words in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem saying Give ear to the words of this agreement and do them
Jer  For I gave certain witness to your fathers on the day when I took them up out of the land of Egypt and even to this day getting up early and witnessing and saying Give ear to my voice
Jer  But they gave no attention and did not give ear but they went on every man in the pride of his evil heart so I sent on them all the curses in this agreement which I gave them orders to keep but they did not
Jer  And the Lord said to me There is an evil design at work among the men of Judah and the people of Jerusalem
Jer  They are turned back to the sins of their fathers who would not give ear to my words they have gone after other gods and become their servants the people of Israel and the people of Judah have not kept the agreement which I made with their fathers
Jer  So the Lord has said I will send evil on them which they will not be able to get away from and they will send up a cry for help to me but I will not give ear to them
Jer  Then the towns of Judah and the people of Jerusalem will go crying for help to the gods to whom they have been burning perfumes but they will give them no salvation in the time of their trouble
Jer  For the number of your gods is as the number of your towns O Judah and for every street in Jerusalem you have put up altars to the Baal for burning perfumes to the Baal
Jer  And as for you make no prayers for this people send up no cry or prayer for them for I will not give ear to their cry in the time of their trouble
Jer  About Judah What have you to do in my house is it your thought that oaths and holy flesh will get you out of your trouble will you make yourself safe in this way
Jer  You had been named by the Lord A branching olivetree fair with beautiful fruit with the noise of a great rushing he has put it on fire and its branches are broken
Jer  For the Lord of armies by whom you were planted has given his decision for evil against you because of the evil which the people of Israel and the people of Judah have done In moving me to wrath by offering perfumes to the Baal
Jer  And the Lord gave me knowledge of it and I saw it then you made clear to me their doings
Jer  But I was like a gentle lamb taken to be put to death I had no thought that they were designing evil against me saying Come and let us make trouble his food cutting him off from the land of the living so that there may be no more memory of his name
Jer  But O Lord of armies judging in righteousness testing the thoughts and the heart let me see your punishment come on them for I have put my cause before you
Jer  So this is what the Lord of armies has said about the men of Anathoth who have made designs against your life saying You are not to be a prophet in the name of the Lord or death will overtake you by our hands
Jer  So the Lord of armies has said See I will send punishment on them the young men will be put to the sword their sons and their daughters will come to death through need of food
Jer  Not one of them will keep his life for I will send evil on the men of Anathoth in the year of their punishment
Jer  You are in the right O Lord when I put my cause before you still let me take up with you the question of your decisions why does the evildoer do well why are the workers of deceit living in comfort
Jer  They have been planted by you they have taken root they go on and give fruit you are near in their mouths but far from their thoughts
Jer  But you O Lord have knowledge of me you see me searching and testing how my heart is with you let them be pulled out like sheep to be put to death make them ready for the day of death
Jer  How long will the land have grief and the plants of all the land be dry because of the sins of the people living in it destruction has overtaken the beasts and the birds because they said God does not see our ways
Jer  If running with the fightingmen has made you tired how will you be able to keep up with horses and if in a land of peace you go in flight what will become of you in the thick growth of Jordan
Jer  For even your brothers your fathers family even they have been untrue to you crying loudly after you have no faith in them though they say fair words to you
Jer  I have given up my house I have let my heritage go I have given the loved one of my soul into the hands of her haters
Jer  My heritage has become like a lion in the woodland to me her voice has been loud against me so I have hate for her
Jer  My heritage is like a brightly coloured bird to me the cruel birds are attacking her on every side go get together all the beasts of the field make them come for destruction
Jer  The keepers of sheep have been the destruction of my vinegarden crushing my heritage under their feet they have made my fair heritage an unplanted waste
Jer  They have made it waste it is weeping to me being wasted all the land is made waste because no man takes it to heart
Jer  Those who make waste have come on all the open hilltops in the waste land for the sword of the Lord sends destruction from one end of the land to the other end of the land no flesh has peace
Jer  Though good grain was planted they have got in thorns they have given themselves pain without profit they will be shamed on account of their produce because of the burning wrath of the Lord
Jer  This is what the Lord has said against all my evil neighbours who put their hands on the heritage which I gave my people Israel See I will have them uprooted from their land uprooting the people of Judah from among them
Jer  And it will come about that after they have been uprooted I will again have pity on them and I will take them back every man to his heritage and every man to his land
Jer  And it will be that if they give their minds to learning the ways of my people using my name in their oaths By the living Lord as they have been teaching my people to take oaths by the Baal then their place will be made certain among my people
Jer  But if they will not give ear then I will have that nation uprooted and given to destruction says the Lord
Jer  This is what the Lord said to me Go and get yourself a linen band and put it round you and do not put it in water
Jer  So as the Lord said I got a band for a price and put it round my body
Jer  And the word of the Lord came to me a second time saying
Jer  Take the band which you got for a price which is round your body and go to Parah and put it in a secret place there in a hole of the rock
Jer  So I went and put it in a secret place by Parah as the Lord had said to me
Jer  Then after a long time the Lord said to me Up go to Parah and get the band which I gave you orders to put there
Jer  So I went to Parah and uncovering the hole took the band from the place where I had put it away and the band was damaged and of no use for anything
Jer  Then the word of the Lord came to me saying
Jer  The Lord has said In this way I will do damage to the pride of Judah and to the great pride of Jerusalem
Jer  These evil people who say they will not give ear to my words who go on in the pride of their hearts and have become servants and worshippers of other gods will become like this band which is of no use for anything
Jer  For as a band goes tightly round a mans body so I made all the people of Israel and all the people of Judah tightly united to me so that they might be a people for me and a name and a praise and a glory but they would not give ear
Jer  So you are to say this word to them This is the word of the Lord the God of Israel Every skin bottle will be full of wine and they will say to you Is it not quite clear to us that every skin bottle will be full of wine
Jer  Then you are to say to them The Lord has said I will make all the people of this land even the kings seated on Davids seat and the priests and the prophets and all the people of Jerusalem overcome with strong drink
Jer  I will have them smashed against one another fathers and sons together says the Lord I will have no pity or mercy I will have no feeling for them to keep me from giving them to destruction
Jer  Give ear and let your ears be open be not lifted up for these are the words of the Lord
Jer  Give glory to the Lord your God before he makes it dark and before your feet are slipping on the dark mountains and while you are looking for a light he makes it into deep dark into black night
Jer  But if you do not give ear to it my soul will be weeping in secret for your pride my eye will be weeping bitterly streaming with water because the Lords flock has been taken away as prisoners
Jer  Say to the king and to the queenmother Make yourselves low be seated on the earth for the crown of your glory has come down from your heads
Jer  The towns of the south are shut up and there is no one to make them open Judah is taken away as prisoners all Judah is taken away as prisoners
Jer  Let your eyes be lifted up O Jerusalem and see those who are coming from the north Where is the flock which was given to you your beautiful flock
Jer  What will you say when he puts over you those whom you yourself have made your friends will not pains take you like a woman in childbirth
Jer  And if you say in your heart Why have these things come on me because of the number of your sins your skirts have been uncovered and violent punishment overtakes you
Jer  Is it possible for the skin of the Ethiopian to be changed or the markings on the leopard Then it might be possible for you to do good who have been trained to do evil
Jer  So I will send them in all directions as dry grass is taken away by the wind of the waste land
Jer  This is your fate the part measured out to you by me says the Lord because you have put me out of your memory and put your faith in what is false
Jer  So I will have your skirts uncovered before your face in order that your shame may be seen
Jer  I have seen your disgusting acts even your false behaviour and your cries of desire and your loose ways on the hills in the field Unhappy are you O Jerusalem you have no desire to be made clean how long will you be in turning back to me
Jer  The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah when there was no water
Jer  Judah is weeping and its doors are dark with sorrow and people are seated on the earth clothed in black and the cry of Jerusalem has gone up
Jer  Their great men have sent their servants for water they come to the holes and there is no water to be seen they come back with nothing in their vessels they are overcome with shame and fear covering their heads
Jer  Those who do work on the land are in fear for there has been no rain on the land and the farmers are shamed covering their heads
Jer  And the roe giving birth in the field lets her young one be uncared for because there is no grass
Jer  And the asses of the field on the open hilltops are opening their mouths wide like jackals to get air their eyes are hollow because there is no grass
Jer  Though our sins give witness against us do something O Lord for the honour of your name for again and again we have been turned away from you we have done evil against you
Jer  O you hope of Israel its saviour in time of trouble why are you like one who is strange in the land and like a traveller putting up his tent for a night
Jer  Why are you like a man surprised like a man of war who is not able to give help but you O Lord are with us and we are named by your name do not go away from us
Jer  This is what the Lord has said about this people Even so they have been glad to go from the right way they have not kept their feet from wandering so the Lord has no pleasure in them now he will keep their wrongdoing in mind and send punishment for their sins
Jer  And the Lord said to me Make no prayer for this people for their good
Jer  When they go without food I will not give ear to their cry when they give burned offerings and meal offerings I will not take pleasure in them but I will put an end to them by the sword and by need of food and by disease
Jer  Then I said Ah Lord God see the prophets say to them You will not see the sword or be short of food but I will give you certain peace in this place
Jer  Then the Lord said to me The prophets say false words in my name and I gave them no orders and I said nothing to them what they say to you is a false vision and wonderworking words without substance the deceit of their hearts
Jer  So this is what the Lord has said about the prophets who make use of my name though I sent them not and say The sword and need of food will not be in this land the sword and need of food will put an end to those prophets
Jer  And the people to whom they are prophets will be pushed out dead into the streets of Jerusalem because there is no food and because of the sword and they will have no one to put their bodies into the earth them or their wives or their sons or their daughters for I will let loose their evildoing on them
Jer  And you are to say this word to them Let my eyes be streaming with water night and day and let it not be stopped for the virgin daughter of my people is wounded with a great wound with a very bitter blow
Jer  If I go out into the open country there are those put to death by the sword and if I go into the town there are those who are diseased from need of food for the prophet and the priest go about in the land and have no knowledge
Jer  Have you completely given up Judah is your soul turned in disgust from Zion why have you given us blows from which there is no one to make us well we were looking for peace but no good came and for a time of wellbeing but there was only a great fear
Jer  We are conscious O Lord of our sin and of the wrongdoing of our fathers we have done evil against you
Jer  Do not be turned from us in disgust because of your name do not put shame on the seat of your glory keep us in mind let not your agreement with us be broken
Jer  Are any of the false gods of the nations able to make rain come are the heavens able to give showers are you not he O Lord our God so we will go on waiting for you for you have done all these things
Jer  Then the Lord said to me Even if Moses and Samuel came before me I would have no desire for this people send them away from before me and let them go
Jer  And it will be when they say to you Where are we to go then you are to say to them The Lord has said Such as are for death to death and such as are for the sword to the sword and such as are to be in need of food to need of food and such as are to be taken away prisoners to be taken away
Jer  And I will put over them four divisions says the Lord the sword causing death dogs pulling the dead bodies about and the birds of heaven and the beasts of the earth to take their bodies for food and put an end to them
Jer  And I will make them a cause of fear to all the kingdoms of the earth because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah and what he did in Jerusalem
Jer  For who will have pity on you O Jerusalem and who will have sorrow for you or who will go out of his way to see how you are
Jer  You have given me up says the Lord you have gone back so my hand is stretched out against you for your destruction I am tired of changing my purpose
Jer  And I have sent a cleaning wind on them in the public places of the land I have taken their children from them I have given my people to destruction they have not been turned from their ways
Jer  I have let their widows be increased in number more than the sand of the seas I have sent against them against the mother and the young men one who makes waste in the heat of the day causing pain and fears to come on her suddenly
Jer  The mother of seven is without strength her spirit is gone from her her sun has gone down while it is still day she has been shamed and overcome and the rest of them I will give up to the sword before their haters says the Lord
Jer  Sorrow is mine my mother because you have given birth to me a cause of fighting and argument in all the earth I have not made men my creditors and I am not in debt to any but every one of them is cursing me
Jer  
Jer  Is it possible for iron to be broken even iron from the north and brass
Jer  I will give your wealth and your stores to your attackers without a price because of all your sins even in every part of your land
Jer  They will go away with your haters into a land which is strange to you for my wrath is on fire with a flame which will be burning on you
Jer  O Lord you have knowledge keep me in mind and come to my help and give their right reward to those who are attacking me take me not away for you are slow to be angry see how I have undergone shame because of you from all those who make little of your word
Jer  But to me your word is a joy making my heart glad for I am named by your name O Lord God of armies
Jer  I did not take my seat among the band of those who are glad and I had no joy I kept by myself because of your hand for you have made me full of wrath
Jer  Why is my pain unending and my wound without hope of being made well Sorrow is mine for you are to me as a stream offering false hope and as waters which are not certain
Jer  For this cause the Lord has said If you will come back then I will again let you take your place before me and if you give out what is of value and not that which has no value you will be as my mouth let them come back to you but do not go back to them
Jer  And I will make you a strong wall of brass to this people they will be fighting against you but they will not overcome you for I am with you to keep you safe says the Lord
Jer  I will keep you safe from the hands of the evildoers and I will give you salvation from the hands of the cruel ones
Jer  Then again the word of the Lord came to me saying
Jer  You are not to take a wife for yourself or have sons or daughters in this place
Jer  For this is what the Lord has said about the sons and daughters who come to birth in this place and about their mothers who have given them birth and about their fathers who have given life to them in this land
Jer  Death from evil diseases will overtake them there will be no weeping for them and their bodies will not be put to rest they will be like waste on the face of the earth the sword and need of food will put an end to them their dead bodies will be meat for the birds of heaven and for the beasts of the earth
Jer  For this is what the Lord has said Do not go into the house of sorrow do not go to make weeping or songs of grief for them for I have taken away my peace from this people says the Lord even mercy and pity
Jer  Death will overtake great as well as small in the land their bodies will not be put in a restingplace and no one will be weeping for them or wounding themselves or cutting off their hair for them
Jer  No one will make a feast for them in sorrow to give them comfort for the dead or put to their lips the cup of comfort on account of their father or their mother
Jer  And you are not to go into the house of feasting or be seated with them to take food or drink
Jer  For the Lord of armies the God of Israel has said See before your eyes and in your days I will put an end in this place to the laughing voices and the voice of joy to the voice of the newlymarried man and the voice of the bride
Jer  And it will be that when you say all these words to the people then they will say to you Why has the Lord done all this evil against us what is our wrongdoing and what is our sin which we have done against the Lord our God
Jer  Then you will say to them Because your fathers have given me up says the Lord and have gone after other gods and become their servants and their worshippers and have given me up and have not kept my law
Jer  And you have done worse evil than your fathers for see every one of you is guided by the pride of his evil heart so as not to give ear to me
Jer  For this reason I will send you away out of this land into a land which is strange to you to you and to your fathers there you will be the servants of other gods day and night and you will have no mercy from me
Jer  For this cause see the days are coming says the Lord when it will no longer be said By the living Lord who took the children of Israel up out of the land of Egypt
Jer  But By the living Lord who took the children of Israel up out of the land of the north and from all the countries where he had sent them and I will take them back again to their land which I gave to their fathers
Jer  See I will send for great numbers of fishermen says the Lord and they will take them like fish in a net and after that I will send for numbers of bowmen and they will go after them driving them from every mountain and from every hill and out of the holes of the rocks
Jer  For my eyes are on all their ways there is no cover for them from my face and their evildoing is not kept secret from my eyes
Jer  And I will give them the reward of their evildoing and their sin twice over because they have made my land unclean and have made my heritage full of the bodies of their unholy and disgusting things
Jer  O Lord my strength and my strong tower my safe place in the day of trouble the nations will come to you from the ends of the earth and say The heritage of our fathers is nothing but deceit even false things in which there is no profit
Jer  Will a man make for himself gods which are no gods
Jer  For this reason truly I will make them see this once I will give them knowledge of my hand and my power and they will be certain that my name is the Lord
Jer  The sin of Judah is recorded with a pen of iron and with the sharp point of a jewel it is cut on their hearts of stone and on the horns of their altars for a sign to them
Jer  Their altars and their wood pillars under every branching tree on the high hills and the mountains in the field
Jer  I will give your wealth and all your stores to be taken away in war without a price because of your sins in every part of your land
Jer  And your hand will have to let go your heritage which I gave you and I will make you a servant to your haters in a land which is strange to you for you have put my wrath on fire with a flame which will go on burning for ever
Jer  This is what the Lord has said Cursed is the man who puts his faith in man and makes flesh his arm and whose heart is turned away from the Lord
Jer  For he will be like the brushwood in the upland and will not see when good comes but his livingplace will be in the dry places in the waste land in a salt and unpeopled land
Jer  A blessing is on the man who puts his faith in the Lord and whose hope the Lord is
Jer  For he will be like a tree planted by the waters pushing out its roots by the stream he will have no fear when the heat comes but his leaf will be green in a dry year he will have no care and will go on giving fruit
Jer  The heart is a twisted thing not to be searched out by man who is able to have knowledge of it
Jer  I the Lord am the searcher of the heart the tester of the thoughts so that I may give to every man the reward of his ways in keeping with the fruit of his doings
Jer  Like the partridge getting eggs together but not producing young is a man who gets wealth but not by right before half his days are ended it will go from him and at his end he will be foolish
Jer  A seat of glory placed on high from the first is our holy place
Jer  O Lord the hope of Israel all who give you up will be put to shame those who go away from you will be cut off from the earth because they have given up the Lord the fountain of living waters
Jer  Make me well O Lord and I will be well be my saviour and I will be safe for you are my hope
Jer  See they say to me Where is the word of the Lord let it come now
Jer  As for me I have not said Let the day of trouble come to them quickly and I have not been hoping for the deathgiving day you have knowledge of what came from my lips it was open before you
Jer  Be not a cause of fear to me you are my safe place in the day of evil
Jer  Let them be put to shame who are attacking me but let me not be shamed let them be overcome with fear but let me not be overcome send on them the day of evil and put them to destruction twice over
Jer  This is what the Lord has said to me Go and take your place in the doorway of Benjamin where the kings of Judah come in and by which they go out and in all the doorways of Jerusalem
Jer  And say to them Give ear to the word of the Lord you kings of Judah and all the people of Jerusalem who come in by these doors
Jer  This is what the Lord has said See to yourselves that you take up no weight on the Sabbath day or take it in through the doors of Jerusalem
Jer  And take no weight out of your houses on the Sabbath day or do any work but keep the Sabbath day holy as I gave orders to your fathers
Jer  But they gave no attention and would not give ear but they made their necks stiff so that they might not give ear and might not get teaching
Jer  And it will be that if with all care you give ear to me says the Lord and take no weight through the doorways of this town on the Sabbath day but keep the Sabbath day holy and do no work in it
Jer  Then through the doors of this town there will come kings and princes seated on the seat of David going in carriages and on horseback they and their princes and the men of Judah and the people of Jerusalem and this town will keep its place for ever
Jer  And they will come from the towns of Judah and from the places round about Jerusalem and from the land of Benjamin and from the lowlands and from the mountains and from the South with burned offerings and offerings of beasts and meal offerings and perfume and offerings of praise to the house of the Lord
Jer  But if you do not give ear to me to keep the Sabbath day holy and to let no weight be lifted and taken through the doors of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day then I will put a fire in its doorways burning up the great houses of Jerusalem and it will never be put out
Jer  The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying
Jer  Up go down to the potters house and there I will let my words come to your ears
Jer  Then I went down to the potters house and he was doing his work on the stones
Jer  And when the vessel which he was forming out of earth got damaged in the hand of the potter he made it again into another vessel as it seemed good to the potter to make it
Jer  Then the word of the Lord came to me saying
Jer  O Israel am I not able to do with you as this potter does says the Lord See like earth in the potters hand are you in my hands O Israel
Jer  Whenever I say anything about uprooting a nation or a kingdom and smashing it and sending destruction on it
Jer  If in that very minute that nation of which I was talking is turned away from its evil my purpose of doing evil to them will be changed
Jer  And whenever I say anything about building up a nation or a kingdom and planting it
Jer  If in that very minute it does evil in my eyes going against my orders then my good purpose which I said I would do for them will be changed
Jer  Now then say to the men of Judah and to the people of Jerusalem This is what the Lord has said See I am forming an evil thing against you and designing a design against you let every man come back now from his evil way and let your ways and your doings be changed for the better
Jer  But they will say There is no hope we will go on in our designs and every one of us will do what he is moved by the pride of his evil heart to do
Jer  So this is what the Lord has said Make search among the nations and see who has had word of such things the virgin of Israel has done a very shocking thing
Jer  Will the white snow go away from the top of Sirion will the cold waters flowing from the mountains become dry
Jer  For my people have put me out of their memory burning perfumes to that which is nothing and because of this I will put a cause of falling in their ways even in the old roads and will make them go on sideroads in a way not lifted up
Jer  Making their land a thing of wonder causing sounds of surprise for ever everyone who goes by will be overcome with wonder shaking his head
Jer  I will send them in flight as from an east wind before the attacker I will let them see my back and not my face on the day of their downfall
Jer  Then they said Come let us make a design against Jeremiah for teaching will never be cut off from the priest or wisdom from the wise or the word from the prophet Come let us make use of his words for an attack on him and let us give attention with care to what he says
Jer  Give thought to me O Lord and give ear to the voice of those who put forward a cause against me
Jer  Is evil to be the reward of good for they have made a deep hole for my soul Keep in mind how I took my place before you to say a good word for them so that your wrath might be turned away from them
Jer  For this cause let their children be without food and give them over to the power of the sword and let their wives be without children and become widows let their men be overtaken by death and their young men be put to the sword in the fight
Jer  Let a cry for help go up from their houses when you send an armed band on them suddenly for they have made a hole in which to take me and have put nets for my feet secretly
Jer  But you Lord have knowledge of all the designs which they have made against my life let not their evildoing be covered or their sin be washed away from before your eyes but let it be a cause of falling before you so do to them in the time of your wrath
Jer  This is what the Lord has said Go and get for money a potters bottle made of earth and take with you some of the responsible men of the people and of the priests
Jer  And go out to the valley of the son of Hinnom by the way into the door of broken pots and there say in a loud voice the words which I will give you
Jer  Say Give ear to the word of the Lord O kings of Judah and people of Jerusalem the Lord of armies the God of Israel has said See I will send evil on this place which will be bitter to the ears of anyone hearing of it
Jer  Because they have given me up and made this place a strange place burning perfumes in it to other gods of whom they and their fathers and the kings of Judah had no knowledge and they have made this place full of the blood of those who have done no wrong
Jer  And they have put up the high places of the Baal burning their sons in the fire a thing which was not ordered by me and it was never in my mind
Jer  For this cause see a time is coming says the Lord when this place will no longer be named Topheth or The valley of the son of Hinnom but The valley of Death
Jer  I will make the purpose of Judah and Jerusalem come to nothing in this place I will have them put to the sword by their haters and by the hands of those who have designs on their life and their dead bodies I will give to be food for the birds of heaven and the beasts of the earth
Jer  And I will make this town a thing of wonder and a cause of surprise everyone who goes by will be overcome with wonder and make sounds of surprise because of all its troubles
Jer  I will make them take the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters for food they will be making a meal of one another because of their bitter need and the cruel grip of their haters and those who have made designs against their life
Jer  Then let the potters bottle be broken before the eyes of the men who have gone with you
Jer  And say to them This is what the Lord of armies has said Even so will this people and this town be broken by me as a potters bottle is broken and may not be put together again and the bodies of the dead will be put in the earth in Topheth till there is no more room
Jer  This is what I will do to this place says the Lord and to its people making this town like Topheth
Jer  And the houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah which they have made unclean will be like the place of Topheth even all the houses on whose roofs perfumes have been burned to all the army of heaven and drink offerings drained out to other gods
Jer  Then Jeremiah came from Topheth where the Lord had sent him to give the prophets word and he took his place in the open square of the Lords house and said to all the people
Jer  The Lord of armies the God of Israel has said See I will send on this town and on all her towns all the evil which I have said because they made their necks stiff so that they might not give ear to my words
Jer  Now it came to the ears of Pashhur the son of Immer the priest who was chief in authority in the house of the Lord that Jeremiah was saying these things
Jer  And Pashhur gave blows to Jeremiah and had his feet chained in a framework of wood in the higher doorway of Benjamin which was in the house of the Lord
Jer  Then on the day after Pashhur let Jeremiah loose Then Jeremiah said to him The Lord has given you the name of Magormissabib Causeoffearoneveryside not Pashhur
Jer  For the Lord has said See I will make you a cause of fear to yourself and to all your friends they will come to their death by the sword of their haters and your eyes will see it and I will give all Judah into the hands of the king of Babylon and he will take them away prisoners into Babylon and put them to the sword
Jer  And more than this I will give all the wealth of this town and all its profits and all its things of value even all the stores of the kings of Judah will I give into the hands of their haters who will put violent hands on them and take them away to Babylon
Jer  And you Pashhur and all who are in your house will go away prisoners you will come to Babylon and there your body will be put to rest you and all your friends to whom you said false words
Jer  O Lord you have been false to me and I was tricked you are stronger than I and have overcome me I have become a thing to be laughed at all the day everyone makes sport of me
Jer  For every word I say is a cry for help I say with a loud voice Violent behaviour and wasting because the word of the Lord is made a shame to me and a cause of laughing all the day
Jer  And if I say I will not keep him in mind I will not say another word in his name then it is in my heart like a burning fire shut up in my bones and I am tired of keeping myself in I am not able to do it
Jer  For numbers of them say evil secretly in my hearing there is fear on every side they say Come let us give witness against him all my nearest friends who are watching for my fall say It may be that he will be taken by deceit and we will get the better of him and give him punishment
Jer  But the Lord is with me as a great one greatly to be feared so my attackers will have a fall and they will not overcome me they will be greatly shamed because they have not done wisely even with an unending shame kept in memory for ever
Jer  But O Lord of armies testing the upright and seeing the thoughts and the heart let me see your punishment come on them for I have put my cause before you
Jer  Make melody to the Lord give praise to the Lord for he has made the soul of the poor man free from the hands of the evildoers
Jer  A curse on the day of my birth let there be no blessing on the day when my mother had me
Jer  A curse on the man who gave the news to my father saying You have a male child making him very glad
Jer  May that man be like the towns overturned by the Lord without mercy let a cry for help come to his ears in the morning and the sound of war in the middle of the day
Jer  Because he did not put me to death before my birth took place so my mothers body would have been my last restingplace and she would have been with child for ever
Jer  Why did I come from my mothers body to see pain and sorrow so that my days might be wasted with shame
Jer  The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur the son of Malchiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest saying
Jer  Will you get directions from the Lord for us for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon is making war against us it may be that the Lord will do something for us like all the wonders he has done and make him go away from us
Jer  Then Jeremiah said to them This is what you are to say to Zedekiah
Jer  The Lord God of Israel has said See I am turning back the instruments of war in your hands with which you are fighting against the king of Babylon and the Chaldaeans who are outside the walls and shutting you in and I will get them together inside this town
Jer  And I myself will be fighting against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm even with angry feeling and passion and in great wrath
Jer  And I will send a great disease on the people living in this town on man and on beast causing their death
Jer  And after that says the Lord I will give up Zedekiah king of Judah and his servants and his people even those in the town who have not come to their end from the disease and the sword and from need of food into the hands of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and into the hands of their haters and into the hands of those desiring their death he will put them to the sword he will not let anyone get away he will have no pity or mercy
Jer  And to this people you are to say The Lord has said See I put before you the way of life and the way of death
Jer  He who keeps in this town will come to his death by the sword and through need of food and through disease but he who goes out and gives himself up to the Chaldaeans who are shutting you in will go on living and will keep his life safe
Jer  For my face is turned to this town for evil and not for good says the Lord it will be given into the hands of the king of Babylon and he will have it burned with fire
Jer  About the family of the king of Judah Give ear to the word of the Lord
Jer  O family of David this is what the Lord has said Do what is right in the morning and make free from the hands of the cruel one him whose goods have been violently taken away or my wrath will go out like fire burning so that no one may put it out because of the evil of your doings
Jer  See I am against you you who are living on the rock of the valley says the Lord you who say Who will come down against us or who will get into our houses
Jer  I will send punishment on you in keeping with the fruit of your doings says the Lord and I will put a fire in her woodlands burning up everything round about her
Jer  This is what the Lord has said Go down to the house of the king of Judah and there give him this word
Jer  And say Give ear to the word of the Lord O king of Judah seated on the seat of David you and your servants and your people who come in by these doors
Jer  This is what the Lord has said Do what is right judging uprightly and make free from the hands of the cruel one him whose goods have been violently taken away do no wrong and be not violent to the man from a strange country and the child without a father and the widow and let not those who have done no wrong be put to death in this place
Jer  For if you truly do this then there will come in through the doors of this house kings seated on the seat of David going in carriages and on horseback he and his servants and his people
Jer  But if you do not give ear to these words I give you my oath by myself says the Lord that this house will become a waste
Jer  For this is what the Lord has said about the family of the king of Judah You are Gilead to me and the top of Lebanon but truly I will make you waste with towns unpeopled
Jer  And I will make ready those who will send destruction on you everyone armed for war by them your best cedartrees will be cut down and put in the fire
Jer  And nations from all sides will go past this town and every man will say to his neighbour Why has the Lord done such things to this great town
Jer  And they will say Because they gave up the agreement of the Lord their God and became worshippers and servants of other gods
Jer  Let there be no weeping for the dead and make no songs of grief for him but make bitter weeping for him who has gone away for he will never come back or see again the country of his birth
Jer  For this is what the Lord has said about Shallum the son of Josiah king of Judah who became king in place of Josiah his father who went out from this place He will never come back there again
Jer  But death will come to him in the place where they have taken him away prisoner and he will never see this land again
Jer  A curse is on him who is building his house by wrongdoing and his rooms by doing what is not right who makes use of his neighbour without payment and gives him nothing for his work
Jer  Who says I will make a wide house for myself and rooms of great size and has windows cut out and has it roofed with cedar and painted with bright red
Jer  Are you to be a king because you make more use of cedar than your father did not your father take food and drink and do right judging in righteousness and then it was well for him
Jer  He was judge in the cause of the poor and those in need then it was well Was not this to have knowledge of me says the Lord
Jer  But your eyes and your heart are fixed only on profit for yourself on causing the death of him who has done no wrong and on violent and cruel acts
Jer  So this is what the Lord has said about Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah They will make no weeping for him saying Ah my brother or Ah sister they will make no weeping for him saying Ah lord or Ah his glory
Jer  They will do to him what they do to the dead body of an ass his body will be pulled out and placed on the earth outside the doors of Jerusalem
Jer  Go up to Lebanon and give a cry let your voice be loud in Bashan crying out from Abarim for all your lovers have come to destruction
Jer  My word came to you in the time of your wellbeing but you said I will not give ear This has been your way from your earliest years you did not give attention to my voice
Jer  All the keepers of your sheep will be food for the wind and your lovers will be taken away prisoners truly then you will be shamed and unhonoured because of all your evildoing
Jer  O you who are living in Lebanon making your livingplace in the cedars how greatly to be pitied will you be when pains come on you as on a woman in childbirth
Jer  By my life says the Lord even if Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah was the ring on my right hand even from there I would have you pulled off
Jer  And I will give you into the hands of those desiring your death and into the hands of those whom you are fearing even into the hands of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and into the hands of the Chaldaeans
Jer  I will send you out and your mother who gave you birth into another country not the land of your birth and there death will come to you
Jer  But to the land on which their souls desire is fixed they will never come back
Jer  Is this man Coniah a broken vessel of no value is he a vessel in which there is no pleasure why are they violently sent out he and his seed into a land which is strange to them
Jer  O earth earth earth give ear to the word of the Lord
Jer  The Lord has said Let this man be recorded as having no children a man who will not do well in all his life for no man of his seed will do well seated on the seat of the kingdom of David and ruling again in Judah
Jer  A curse is on the keepers who are causing the destruction and loss of the sheep of my field says the Lord
Jer  So this is what the Lord the God of Israel has said against the keepers who have the care of my people You have let my flock be broken up driving them away and not caring for them see I will send on you the punishment for the evil of your doings says the Lord
Jer  And I will get the rest of my flock together from all the countries where I have sent them and will make them come back again to their restingplace and they will have offspring and be increased
Jer  And I will put over them keepers who will take care of them never again will they be overcome with fear or be troubled and there will not be the loss of one of them says the Lord
Jer  See the days are coming says the Lord when I will give to David a true Branch and he will be ruling as king acting wisely doing what is right and judging uprightly in the land
Jer  In his days Judah will have salvation and Israel will be living without fear and this is the name by which he will be named The Lord is our righteousness
Jer  And so truly the days are coming when they will say no longer By the living Lord who took the children of Israel up out of the land of Egypt
Jer  But By the living Lord who took up the seed of Israel and made them come out of the north country and from all the countries where I had sent them and they will be living in the land which is theirs
Jer  About the prophets My heart is broken in me all my bones are shaking I am like a man full of strong drink like a man overcome by wine because of the Lord and because of his holy words
Jer  For the land is full of men who are untrue to their wives because of the curse the land is full of grief the green fields of the waste land have become dry and they are quick to do evil their strength is for what is not right
Jer  For the prophet as well as the priest is unclean even in my house I have seen their evildoing says the Lord
Jer  For this cause their steps will be slipping on their way they will be forced on into the dark and have a fall there for I will send evil on them in the year of their punishment says the Lord
Jer  And I have seen ways without sense in the prophets of Samaria they became prophets of the Baal causing my people Israel to go wrong
Jer  And in the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a shocking thing they are untrue to their wives walking in deceit and they make strong the hands of evildoers so that a man may not be turned back from his evildoing they have all become like Sodom to me and its people like Gomorrah
Jer  So this is what the Lord of armies has said about the prophets See I will give them a bitter plant for their food and bitter water for their drink for from the prophets of Jerusalem unclean behaviour has gone out into all the land
Jer  This is what the Lord of armies has said Do not give ear to the words which the prophets say to you they give you teaching of no value it is from themselves that their vision comes and not out of the mouth of the Lord
Jer  They keep on saying to those who have no respect for the word of the Lord You will have peace and to everyone who goes on his way in the pride of his heart they say No evil will come to you
Jer  For which of them has knowledge of the secret of the Lord and has seen him and given ear to his word which of them has taken note of his word and given attention to it
Jer  See the stormwind of the Lord even the heat of his wrath has gone out a rolling storm bursting on the heads of the evildoers
Jer  The wrath of the Lord will not be turned back till he has done till he has put into effect the purposes of his heart in days to come you will have full knowledge of this
Jer  I did not send these prophets but they went running I said nothing to them but they gave out the prophets word
Jer  But if they had been in my secret then they would have made my people give ear to my words turning them from their evil way and from the evil of their doings
Jer  Am I only a God who is near says the Lord and not a God at a distance
Jer  In what secret place may a man take cover without my seeing him says the Lord Is there any place in heaven or earth where I am not says the Lord
Jer  My ears have been open to what the prophets have said who say false words in my name saying I have had a dream I have had a dream I have had a dream
Jer  Is my word in the hearts of the prophets who give out false words even the prophets of the deceit of their hearts
Jer  Whose purpose is to take away the memory of my name from my people by their dreams of which every man is talking to his neighbour as their fathers gave up the memory of my name for the Baal
Jer  If a prophet has a dream let him give out his dream and he who has my word let him give out my word in good faith What has the dry stem to do with the grain says the Lord
Jer  Is not my word like fire says the Lord and like a hammer smashing the rock to bits
Jer  For this cause I am against the prophets says the Lord who take my words every one from his neighbour
Jer  See I am against the prophets says the Lord who let their tongues say He has said
Jer  See I am against the prophets of false dreams says the Lord who give them out and make my people go out of the way by their deceit and their uncontrolled words but I did not send them or give them orders and they will be of no profit to this people says the Lord
Jer  And if this people or the prophet or a priest questioning you says What word of weight is there from the Lord then you are to say to them You are the word for I will not be troubled with you any more says the Lord
Jer  And as for the prophet and the priest and the people who say A word of weight from the Lord I will send punishment on that man and on his house
Jer  But this is what you are to say every man to his neighbour and every man to his brother What answer has the Lord given and What has the Lord said
Jer  And you will no longer put people in mind of the word of weight of the Lord for every mans word will be a weight on himself for the words of the living God of the Lord of armies our God have been twisted by you
Jer  This is what you are to say to the prophet What answer has the Lord given to you and What has the Lord said
Jer  But if you say The word of weight of the Lord this is what the Lord has said Because you say The weight of the Lord and I have sent to you saying You are not to say The weight of the Lord
Jer  For this reason truly I will put you completely out of my memory and I will put you and the town which I gave to you and to your fathers away from before my face
Jer  And I will give you a name without honour for ever and unending shame which will never go from the memory of men
Jer  The Lord gave me a vision and I saw two baskets full of figs put in front of the Temple of the Lord after Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had taken prisoner Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and the chiefs of Judah and the expert workmen and metalworkers from Jerusalem and had taken them to Babylon
Jer  One basket had very good figs like the figs which first come to growth and the other basket had very bad figs so bad that they were of no use for food
Jer  Then the Lord said to me What do you see Jeremiah And I said Figs the good figs are very good and the bad very bad and of no use for food they are so bad
Jer  And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Jer  This is what the Lord the God of Israel has said Like these good figs so in my eyes will be the prisoners of Judah whom I have sent from this place into the land of the Chaldaeans for their good
Jer  For I will keep my eyes on them for good and I will take them back again to this land building them up and not pulling them down planting them and not uprooting them
Jer  And I will give them a heart to have knowledge of me that I am the Lord and they will be my people and I will be their God for they will come back to me with all their heart
Jer  And like the bad figs which are so bad that they are of no use for food so I will give up Zedekiah king of Judah and his chiefs and the rest of Jerusalem who are still in this land and those who are in the land of Egypt
Jer  I will give them up to be a cause of fear and of trouble among all the kingdoms of the earth to be a name of shame and common talk and a cutting word and a curse in all the places wherever I will send them wandering
Jer  And I will send the sword and need of food and disease among them till they are all cut off from the land which I gave to them and to their fathers
Jer  The word which came to Jeremiah about all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah this was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon
Jer  This word Jeremiah gave out to all the people of Judah and to those living in Jerusalem saying
Jer  From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah even till this day for twentythree years the word of the Lord has been coming to me and I have given it to you getting up early and talking to you but you have not given ear
Jer  And the Lord has sent to you all his servants the prophets getting up early and sending them but you have not given attention and your ear has not been open to give hearing
Jer  Saying Come back now everyone from his evil way and from the evil of your doings and keep your place in the land which the Lord has given to you and to your fathers from times long past even for ever
Jer  Do not go after other gods to be their servants and to give them worship and do not make me angry with the work of your hands causing evil to yourselves
Jer  But you have not given ear to me says the Lord so that you have made me angry with the work of your hands causing evil to yourselves
Jer  So this is what the Lord of armies has said Because you have not given ear to my words
Jer  See I will send and take all the families of the north says the Lord and Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon my servant and make them come against this land and against its people and against all these nations on every side and I will give them up to complete destruction and make them a cause of fear and surprise and a waste place for ever
Jer  And more than this I will take from them the sound of laughing voices the voice of joy the voice of the newlymarried man and the voice of the bride the sound of the stones crushing the grain and the shining of lights
Jer  All this land will be a waste and a cause of wonder and these nations will be the servants of the king of Babylon for seventy years
Jer  And it will come about after seventy years are ended that I will send punishment on the king of Babylon and on that nation says the Lord for their evildoing and on the land of the Chaldaeans and I will make it a waste for ever
Jer  And I will make that land undergo everything I have said against it even everything recorded in this book which Jeremiah the prophet has said against all the nations
Jer  For a number of nations and great kings will make servants of them even of them and I will give them the reward of their acts even the reward of the work of their hands
Jer  For this is what the Lord the God of Israel has said to me Take the cup of the wine of this wrath from my hand and make all the nations to whom I send you take of it
Jer  And after drinking it they will go rolling from side to side and be off their heads because of the sword which I will send among them
Jer  Then I took the cup from the Lords hand and gave a drink from it to all the nations to whom the Lord sent me
Jer  Jerusalem and the towns of Judah and their kings and their princes to make them a waste place a cause of fear and surprise and a curse as it is this day
Jer  Pharaoh king of Egypt and his servants and his princes and all his people
Jer  And all the mixed people and all the kings of the land of Uz and all the kings of the land of the Philistines and Ashkelon and Gaza and Ekron and the rest of Ashdod
Jer  Edom and Moab and the children of Ammon
Jer  And all the kings of Tyre and all the kings of Zidon and the kings of the lands across the sea
Jer  Dedan and Tema and Buz and all who have the ends of their hair cut
Jer  And all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the mixed people living in the waste land
Jer  And all the kings of Zimri and all the kings of Elam and all the kings of the Medes
Jer  And all the kings of the north far and near one with another and all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth
Jer  And you are to say to them This is what the Lord of armies the God of Israel has said Take of this cup and be overcome and let it come out again from your lips and from your fall you will never be lifted up again because of the sword which I will send among you
Jer  And it will be if they will not take of the cup in your hand then you are to say to them This is what the Lord of armies has said You will certainly take of it
Jer  For see I am starting to send evil on the town which is named by my name and are you to be without any punishment You will not be without punishment for I will send a sword on all people living on the earth says the Lord of armies
Jer  So as a prophet give out these words among them and say to them The voice of the Lord will be sounding like a lion from on high he will send out his voice from his holy place like the loud voice of a lion against his flock he will give a cry like those who are crushing the grapes against all the people of the earth
Jer  A noise will come even to the end of the earth for the Lord has a cause against the nations he will give his decision against all flesh as for the evildoers he will give them to the sword says the Lord
Jer  This is what the Lord of armies has said See evil is going out from nation to nation and a great storm will come up from the inmost parts of the earth
Jer  And at that day the bodies of those whom the Lord has put to death will be seen from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth there will be no weeping for them their bodies will not be taken up or put to rest in the earth they will be like waste on the face of the land
Jer  Give cries of grief you keepers of sheep give cries for help rolling yourselves in the dust you chiefs of the flock for the days of your destruction have fully come and I will send you in all directions and your fall will be like that of the males of the flock
Jer  There will be no way of flight for the keepers of sheep no road for the chiefs of the flock to get away safely
Jer  A sound of the cry of the keepers of sheep and the bitter crying of the chiefs of the flock for the Lord has made waste their green fields
Jer  And there is no sound in the fields of peace because of the burning wrath of the Lord
Jer  The lion has come out of his secret place for the land has become a waste because of the cruel sword and because of the heat of his wrath
Jer  When Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah first became king this word came from the Lord saying
Jer  This is what the Lord has said Take your place in the open square of the Lords house and say to all the towns of Judah who come into the Lords house for worship everything I give you orders to say to them keep back not a word
Jer  It may be that they will give ear and that every man will be turned from his evil way so that my purpose of sending evil on them because of the evil of their doings may be changed
Jer  And you are to say to them This is what the Lord has said If you do not give ear to me and go in the way of my law which I have put before you
Jer  And give ear to the words of my servants the prophets whom I send to you getting up early and sending them though you gave no attention
Jer  Then I will make this house like Shiloh and will make this town a curse to all the nations of the earth
Jer  And in the hearing of the priests and the prophets and all the people Jeremiah said these words in the house of the Lord
Jer  Now when Jeremiah had come to the end of saying everything the Lord had given him orders to say to all the people the priests and the prophets and all the people took him by force saying Death will certainly be your fate
Jer  Why have you said in the name of the Lord This house will be like Shiloh and this land a waste with no one living in it And all the people had come together to Jeremiah in the house of the Lord
Jer  And the rulers of Judah hearing of these things came up from the kings house to the house of the Lord and took their seats by the new door of the Lords house
Jer  Then the priests and the prophets said to the rulers and to all the people The right fate for this man is death for he has said words against this town in your hearing
Jer  Then Jeremiah said to all the rulers and to all the people The Lord has sent me as his prophet to say against this house and against this town all the words which have come to your ears
Jer  So now make a change for the better in your ways and your doings and give ear to the voice of the Lord your God then the Lord will let himself be turned from the decision he has made against you for evil
Jer  As for me here I am in your hands do with me whatever seems good and right in your opinion
Jer  Only be certain that if you put me to death you will make yourselves and your town and its people responsible for the blood of one who has done no wrong for truly the Lord has sent me to you to say all these words in your ears
Jer  Then the rulers and all the people said to the priests and the prophets It is not right for this man to be put to death for he has said words to us in the name of the Lord our God
Jer  Then some of the responsible men of the land got up and said to all the meeting of the people
Jer  Micah the Morashtite who was a prophet in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah said to all the people of Judah This is what the Lord of armies has said Zion will become like a ploughed field and Jerusalem will become a mass of broken walls and the mountain of the house like the high places of the woodland
Jer  Did Hezekiah and all Judah put him to death did he not in the fear of the Lord make prayer for the grace of the Lord and the Lord let himself be turned from the decision he had made against them for evil By this act we might do great evil against ourselves
Jer  And there was another man who was a prophet of the Lord Uriah the son of Shemaiah of Kiriathjearim he said against this town and against this land all the words which Jeremiah had said
Jer  And when his words came to the ears of Jehoiakim the king and all his men of war and his captains the king would have put him to death but Uriah hearing of it was full of fear and went in flight into Egypt
Jer  And Jehoiakim the king sent Elnathan the son of Achbor and certain men with him into Egypt
Jer  And they took Uriah out of Egypt and came back with him to Jehoiakim the king who put him to death with the sword and had his dead body put into the restingplace of the bodies of the common people
Jer  But Ahikam the son of Shaphan gave Jeremiah his help so that he was not given into the hands of the people to be put to death
Jer  When Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah first became king this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying
Jer  This is what the Lord has said to me Make for yourself bands and yokes and put them on your neck
Jer  And send them to the king of Edom and to the king of Moab and to the king of the children of Ammon and to the king of Tyre and to the king of Zidon by their servants who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah
Jer  And give them orders to say to their masters This is what the Lord of armies the God of Israel has said Say to your masters
Jer  I have made the earth and man and beast on the face of the earth by my great power and by my outstretched arm and I will give it to anyone at my pleasure
Jer  And now I have given all these lands into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon my servant and I have given the beasts of the field to him for his use
Jer  And all the nations will be servants to him and to his son and to his sons son till the time comes for his land to be overcome and then a number of nations and great kings will take it for their use
Jer  And it will come about that if any nation does not become a servant to this same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and does not put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon then I will send punishment on that nation says the Lord by the sword and need of food and by disease till I have given them into his hands
Jer  And you are not to give attention to your prophets or your readers of signs or your dreamers or those who see into the future or those who make use of secret arts who say to you You will not become servants of the king of Babylon
Jer  For they say false words to you so that you may be sent away far from your land and so that you may be forced out by me and come to destruction
Jer  But as for that nation which puts its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and becomes his servant I will let that nation keep on in its land farming it and living in it says the Lord
Jer  And I said all this to Zedekiah king of Judah saying Put your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and become his servants and his people so that you may keep your lives
Jer  Why are you desiring death you and your people by the sword and because food is gone and by disease as the Lord has said of the nation which does not become the servant of the king of Babylon
Jer  And you are not to give ear to the prophets who say to you You will not become servants of the king of Babylon for what they say is not true
Jer  For I have not sent them says the Lord but they are saying what is false in my name so that I might send you out by force causing destruction to come on you and on your prophets
Jer  And I said to the priests and to all the people This is what the Lord has said Give no attention to the words of your prophets who say to you See in a very little time now the vessels of the Lords house will come back again from Babylon for what they say to you is false
Jer  Give no attention to them become servants of the king of Babylon and keep yourselves from death why let this town become a waste
Jer  But if they are prophets and if the word of the Lord is with them let them now make request to the Lord of armies that the vessels which are still in the house of the Lord and in the house of the king of Judah and at Jerusalem may not go to Babylon
Jer  For this is what the Lord has said about the rest of the vessels which are still in this town
Jer  Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take away when he took Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah a prisoner from Jerusalem to Babylon with all the great men of Judah and Jerusalem
Jer  For this is what the Lord of armies the God of Israel has said about the rest of the vessels in the house of the Lord and in the house of the king of Judah and at Jerusalem
Jer  They will be taken away to Babylon and there they will be till the day when I send their punishment on them says the Lord Then I will take them up and put them back in their place
Jer  And it came about in that year when Zedekiah first became king of Judah in the fourth year in the fifth month that Hananiah the son of Azzur the prophet who came from Gibeon said to Jeremiah in the house of the Lord before the priests and all the people
Jer  These are the words of the Lord of armies the God of Israel By me the yoke of the king of Babylon has been broken
Jer  In the space of two years I will send back into this place all the vessels of the Lords house which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place to Babylon
Jer  And I will let Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah come back to this place with all the prisoners of Judah who went to Babylon says the Lord for I will have the yoke of the king of Babylon broken
Jer  Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah before the priests and all the people who had come into the house of the Lord
Jer  The prophet Jeremiah said So be it may the Lord do so may the Lord give effect to the words which you have said and let the vessels of the Lords house and all the people who have been taken away come back from Babylon to this place
Jer  But still give ear to this word which I am saying to you and to all the people
Jer  The prophets who were before me and before you from early times gave word to a number of countries and great kingdoms about war and destruction and disease
Jer  The prophet whose words are of peace when his words come true will be seen to be a prophet whom the Lord has sent
Jer  Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from the neck of the prophet Jeremiah and it was broken by his hands
Jer  And before all the people Hananiah said The Lord has said Even so will I let the yoke of the king of Babylon be broken off the necks of all the nations in the space of two years Then the prophet Jeremiah went away
Jer  Then after the yoke had been broken off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah by Hananiah the prophet the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah saying
Jer  Go and say to Hananiah This is what the Lord has said Yokes of wood have been broken by you but in their place I will make yokes of iron
Jer  For the Lord of armies the God of Israel has said I have put a yoke of iron on the necks of all these nations making them servants to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and they are to be his servants and in addition I have given him the beasts of the field
Jer  Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet Give ear now Hananiah the Lord has not sent you but you are making this people put their faith in what is false
Jer  For this reason the Lord has said See I will send you away from off the face of the earth this year death will overtake you because you have said words against the Lord
Jer  So death came to Hananiah the prophet the same year in the seventh month
Jer  Now these are the words of the letter which Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the responsible men among those who had been taken away and to the priests and the prophets and to all the rest of the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken away prisoners from Jerusalem to Babylon
Jer  After Jeconiah the king and the queenmother and the unsexed servants and the rulers of Judah and Jerusalem and the expert workmen and the metalworkers had gone away from Jerusalem
Jer  By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon saying
Jer  This is what the Lord of armies the God of Israel has said to all those whom I have taken away prisoners from Jerusalem to Babylon
Jer  Go on building houses and living in them and planting gardens and using the fruit of them
Jer  Take wives and have sons and daughters and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands so that they may have sons and daughters and be increased in number there and do not become less
Jer  And be working for the peace of the land to which I have had you taken away prisoners and make prayer to the Lord for it for in its peace you will have peace
Jer  For this is what the Lord of armies the God of Israel has said Do not let yourselves be tricked by the prophets who are among you and the readers of signs and give no attention to their dreams which they may have
Jer  For they are saying to you what is false in my name I have not sent them says the Lord
Jer  For this is what the Lord has said When seventy years are ended for Babylon I will have pity on you and give effect to my good purpose for you causing you to come back to this place
Jer  For I am conscious of my thoughts about you says the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you hope at the end
Jer  And you will go on crying to me and making prayer to me and I will give ear to you
Jer  And you will be searching for me and I will be there when you have gone after me with all your heart
Jer  I will be near you again says the Lord and your fate will be changed and I will get you together from all the nations and from all the places where I had sent you away says the Lord and I will take you back again to the place from which I sent you away prisoners
Jer  For you have said The Lord has given us prophets in Babylon
Jer  For this is what the Lord has said about the king who is seated on the seat of Davids kingdom and about all the people living in this town your countrymen who have not gone out with you as prisoners
Jer  This is what the Lord of armies has said See I will send on them the sword and need of food and disease and will make them like bad figs which are of no use for food they are so bad
Jer  I will go after them attacking them with the sword and with need of food and with disease and will make them a cause of fear to all the kingdoms of the earth to be a curse and a wonder and a surprise and a name of shame among all the nations where I have sent them
Jer  Because they have not given ear to my words says the Lord when I sent to them my servants the prophets getting up early and sending them but you did not give ear says the Lord
Jer  And now give ear to the word of the Lord all you whom I have sent away prisoners from Jerusalem to Babylon
Jer  This is what the Lord of armies the God of Israel has said about Ahab the son of Kolaiah and about Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah who are saying to you what is false in my name See I will give them up into the hands of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and he will put them to death before your eyes
Jer  And their fate will be used as a curse by all the prisoners of Judah who are in Babylon who will say May the Lord make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab who were burned in the fire by the king of Babylon
Jer  Because they have done shame in Israel and have taken their neighbours wives and in my name have said false words which I did not give them orders to say and I myself am the witness says the Lord
Jer  About Shemaiah the Nehelamite
Jer  Shemaiah the Nehelamite sent a letter in his name to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest saying
Jer  The Lord has made you priest in place of Jehoiada the priest to be an overseer in the house of the Lord for every man who is off his head and is acting as a prophet to put such men in prison and in chains
Jer  So why have you made no protest against Jeremiah of Anathoth who is acting as a prophet to you
Jer  For he has sent to us in Babylon saying The time will be long go on building houses and living in them and planting gardens and using the fruit of them
Jer  And Zephaniah the priest made clear to Jeremiah the prophet what was said in the letter reading it to him
Jer  Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet saying
Jer  Send to all those who have been taken away saying This is what the Lord has said about Shemaiah the Nehelamite Because Shemaiah has been acting as a prophet to you and I did not send him and has made you put your faith in what is false
Jer  For this cause the Lord has said Truly I will send punishment on Shemaiah and on his seed not a man of his family will have a place among this people and he will not see the good which I am going to do to my people says the Lord because he has said words against the Lord
Jer  The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying
Jer  The Lord the God of Israel has said Put down in a book all the words which I have said to you
Jer  For see the days are coming says the Lord when I will let the fate of my people Israel and Judah be changed says the Lord and I will make them come back to the land which I gave to their fathers so that they may take it for their heritage
Jer  And these are the words which the Lord said about Israel and about Judah
Jer  This is what the Lord has said A voice of shaking fear has come to our ears of fear and not of peace
Jer  Put the question and see if it is possible for a man to have birthpains why do I see every man with his hands gripping his sides as a woman does when the pains of birth are on her and all faces are turned green
Jer  Ha for that day is so great that there is no day like it it is the time of Jacobs trouble but he will get salvation from it
Jer  For it will come about on that day says the Lord of armies that his yoke will be broken off his neck and his bands will be burst and men of strange lands will no longer make use of him as their servant
Jer  But they will be servants to the Lord their God and to David their king whom I will give back to them
Jer  So have no fear O Jacob my servant says the Lord and do not be troubled O Israel for see I will make you come back from far away and your seed from the land where they are prisoners and Jacob will come back and will be quiet and at peace and no one will give him cause for fear
Jer  For I am with you says the Lord to be your saviour for I will put an end to all the nations where I have sent you wandering but I will not put an end to you completely though with wise purpose I will put right your errors and will not let you go quite without punishment
Jer  For the Lord has said Your disease may not be made well and your wound is bitter
Jer  There is no help for your wound there is nothing to make you well
Jer  Your lovers have no more thought for you they go after you no longer for I have given you the wound of a hater even cruel punishment
Jer  Why are you crying for help because of your wound for your pain may never be taken away because your evildoing was so great and because your sins were increased I have done these things to you
Jer  For this cause all those who take you for their food will themselves become your food and all your attackers every one of them will be taken prisoners and those who send destruction on you will come to destruction and all those who take away your goods by force will undergo the same themselves
Jer  For I will make you healthy again and I will make you well from your wounds says the Lord because they have given you the name of an outlaw saying It is Zion cared for by no man
Jer  The Lord has said See I am changing the fate of the tents of Jacob and I will have pity on his houses the town will be put up on its hill and the great houses will be livingplaces again
Jer  And from them will go out praise and the sound of laughing and I will make them great in number and they will not become less and I will give them glory and they will not be small
Jer  And their children will be as they were in the old days and the meeting of the people will have its place before me and I will send punishment on all who are cruel to them
Jer  And their chief will be of their number their ruler will come from among themselves and I will let him be present before me so that he may come near to me for who may have strength of heart to come near me says the Lord
Jer  And you will be my people and I will be your God
Jer  See the stormwind of the Lord even the heat of his wrath has gone out a rolling storm bursting on the heads of the evildoers
Jer  The wrath of the Lord will not be turned back till he has done till he has put into effect the purposes of his heart in days to come you will have full knowledge of this
Jer  At that time says the Lord I will be the God of all the families of Israel and they will be my people
Jer  The Lord has said Grace came in the waste land to a people kept safe from the sword even to Israel on the way to his restingplace
Jer  From far away he saw the Lord my love for you is an eternal love so with mercy I have made you come with me
Jer  I will again make new your buildings O virgin of Israel and you will take up your place again you will take up your instruments of music and go out in the dances of those who are glad
Jer  Again will your vinegardens be planted on the hill of Samaria the planters will be planting and using the fruit
Jer  For there will be a day when those who get in the grapes on the hills of Ephraim will be crying Up let us go up to Zion to the Lord our God
Jer  For the Lord has said Make a glad song for Jacob and give a cry on the top of the mountains give the news give praise and say The Lord has given salvation to his people even to the rest of Israel
Jer  See I will take them from the north country and get them from the inmost parts of the earth and with them the blind and the feeblefooted the woman with child and her who is in birthpains together a very great army they will come back here
Jer  They will come with weeping and going before them I will be their guide guiding them by streams of water in a straight way where there is no falling for I am a father to Israel and Ephraim is the first of my sons
Jer  Give ear to the word of the Lord O you nations and give news of it in the sealands far away and say He who has sent Israel wandering will get him together and will keep him as a keeper does his flock
Jer  For the Lord has given a price for Jacob and made him free from the hands of him who was stronger than he
Jer  So they will come with songs on the high places flowing together to the good things of the Lord to the grain and the wine and the oil to the young ones of the flock and of the herd their souls will be like a watered garden and they will have no more sorrow
Jer  Then the virgin will have joy in the dance and the young men and the old will be glad for I will have their weeping turned into joy I will give them comfort and make them glad after their sorrow
Jer  I will give the priests their desired fat things and my people will have a full measure of my good things says the Lord
Jer  So has the Lord said In Ramah there is a sound of crying weeping and bitter sorrow Rachel weeping for her children she will not be comforted for their loss
Jer  The Lord has said this Keep your voice from sorrow and your eyes from weeping for your work will be rewarded says the Lord and they will come back from the land of their hater
Jer  And there is hope for the future says the Lord and your children will come back to the land which is theirs
Jer  Certainly Ephraims words of grief have come to my ears You have given me training and I have undergone it like a young cow unused to the yoke let me be turned and come back for you are the Lord my God
Jer  Truly after I had been turned I had regret for my ways and after I had got knowledge I made signs of sorrow I was put to shame truly I was covered with shame because I had to undergo the shame of my early years
Jer  Is Ephraim my dear son is he the child of my delight for whenever I say things against him I still keep him in my memory so my heart is troubled for him I will certainly have mercy on him says the Lord
Jer  Put up guiding pillars make road signs for yourself give attention to the highway even the way in which you went be turned again O virgin of Israel be turned to these your towns
Jer  How long will you go on turning this way and that O wandering daughter for the Lord has made a new thing on the earth a woman changed into a man
Jer  So the Lord of armies the God of Israel has said Again will these words be used in the land of Judah and in its towns when I have let their fate be changed May the blessing of the Lord be on you O restingplace of righteousness O holy mountain
Jer  And Judah and all its towns will be living there together the farmers and those who go about with flocks
Jer  For I have given new strength to the tired soul and to every sorrowing soul in full measure
Jer  At this awaking from my sleep I saw and my sleep was sweet to me
Jer  See the days are coming says the Lord when I will have Israel and Judah planted with the seed of man and with the seed of beast
Jer  And it will come about that as I have been watching over them for the purpose of uprooting and smashing down and overturning and sending destruction and causing trouble so I will be watching over them for the purpose of building up and planting says the Lord
Jer  In those days they will no longer say The fathers have been tasting bitter grapes and the childrens teeth are put on edge
Jer  But everyone will be put to death for the evil which he himself has done whoever has taken bitter grapes will himself have his teeth put on edge
Jer  See the days are coming says the Lord when I will make a new agreement with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah
Jer  Not like the agreement which I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to be their guide out of the land of Egypt which agreement was broken by them and I gave them up says the Lord
Jer  But this is the agreement which I will make with the people of Israel after those days says the Lord I will put my law in their inner parts writing it in their hearts and I will be their God and they will be my people
Jer  And no longer will they be teaching every man his neighbour and every man his brother saying Get knowledge of the Lord for they will all have knowledge of me from the least of them to the greatest of them says the Lord for they will have my forgiveness for their evildoing and their sin will go from my memory for ever
Jer  These are the words of the Lord who has given the sun for a light by day ordering the moon and stars for a light by night who puts the sea in motion causing the thunder of its waves the Lord of armies is his name
Jer  If the order of these things before me is ever broken says the Lord then will the seed of Israel come to an end as a nation before me for ever
Jer  This is what the Lord has said If the heavens on high may be measured and the bases of the earth searched out then I will give up the seed of Israel because of all they have done says the Lord
Jer  See the days are coming says the Lord for the building of the Lords town from the tower of Hananel to the doorway of the angle
Jer  And the measuringline will go out in front of it as far as the hill Gareb going round to Goah
Jer  And all the valley of the dead bodies and all the field of death as far as the stream Kidron up to the angle of the horses doorway to the east will be holy to the Lord it will not again be uprooted or overturned for ever
Jer  The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar
Jer  Now at that time the king of Babylons army was round Jerusalem shutting it in and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the place of the armed watchmen in the house of the king of Judah
Jer  For Zedekiah king of Judah had had him shut up saying Why have you as a prophet been saying The Lord has said See I will give this town into the hands of the king of Babylon and he will take it
Jer  And Zedekiah king of Judah will not get away from the hands of the Chaldaeans but will certainly be given up into the hands of the king of Babylon and will have talk with him mouth to mouth and see him eye to eye
Jer  And he will take Zedekiah away to Babylon where he will be till I have pity on him says the Lord though you are fighting with the Chaldaeans things will not go well for you
Jer  And Jeremiah said The word of the Lord came to me saying
Jer  See Hanamel the son of Shallum your fathers brother will come to you and say Give the price and get for yourself my property in Anathoth for you have the right of the nearest relation
Jer  So Hanamel the son of my fathers brother came to me as the Lord had said to the place of the armed watchmen and said to me Give the price and get my property which is in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin for you have the nearest relations right to the heritage so get it for yourself Then it was clear to me that this was the word of the Lord
Jer  So I got for a price the property in Anathoth from Hanamel the son of my fathers brother and gave him the money seventeen shekels of silver
Jer  And I put it in writing stamping it with my stamp and I took witnesses and put the money into the scales
Jer  So I took the paper witnessing the business one copy rolled up and stamped and one copy open
Jer  And I gave the paper to Baruch the son of Neriah the son of Mahseiah before the eyes of Hanamel the son of my fathers brother and of the witnesses who had put their names to the paper and before all the Jews who were seated in the place of the armed watchmen
Jer  And I gave orders to Baruch in front of them saying
Jer  This is what the Lord of armies the God of Israel has said Take these papers the witness of this business the one which is rolled up and stamped and the one which is open and put them in a vessel of earth so that they may be kept for a long time
Jer  For the Lord of armies the God of Israel has said There will again be trading in houses and fields and vinegardens in this land
Jer  Now after I had given the paper to Baruch the son of Neriah I made my prayer to the Lord saying
Jer  Ah Lord God see you have made the heaven and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm and there is nothing you are not able to do
Jer  You have mercy on thousands and send punishment for the evildoing of the fathers on their children after them the great the strong God the Lord of armies is his name
Jer  Great in wisdom and strong in act whose eyes are open on all the ways of the sons of men giving to everyone the reward of his ways and the fruit of his doings
Jer  You have done signs and wonders in the land of Egypt and even to this day in Israel and among other men and have made a name for yourself as at this day
Jer  And have taken your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and with wonders and with a strong hand and an outstretched arm causing great fear
Jer  And have given them this land which you gave your word to their fathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honey
Jer  And they came in and took it for their heritage but they did not give ear to your voice and were not ruled by your law they have done nothing of all you gave them orders to do so you have made all this evil come on them
Jer  See they have made earthworks against the town to take it and the town is given into the hands of the Chaldaeans who are fighting against it because of the sword and need of food and disease and what you have said has taken place and truly you see it
Jer  And you have said to me Give the money to get yourself a property and have the business witnessed though the town is given into the hands of the Chaldaeans
Jer  And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah saying
Jer  See I am the Lord the God of all flesh is there anything so hard that I am unable to do it
Jer  So this is what the Lord has said See I am giving this town into the hands of the Chaldaeans and into the hands of Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon and he will take it
Jer  And the Chaldaeans who are fighting against this town will come and put the town on fire burning it together with the houses on the roofs of which perfumes have been burned to the Baal and drink offerings have been drained out to other gods moving me to wrath
Jer  For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done nothing but evil in my eyes from their earliest years the children of Israel have only made me angry with the work of their hands says the Lord
Jer  For this town has been to me a cause of wrath and of burning passion from the day of its building till this day so that I put it away from before my face
Jer  Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah which they have done to make me angry they and their kings their princes their priests and their prophets and the men of Judah and the people of Jerusalem
Jer  And they have been turning their backs and not their faces to me and though I was their teacher getting up early and teaching them their ears were not open to teaching
Jer  But they put their disgusting images into the house which is named by my name making it unclean
Jer  And they put up the high places of the Baal in the valley of the son of Hinnom making their sons and their daughters go through the fire to Molech which I did not give them orders to do and it never came into my mind that they would do this disgusting thing causing Judah to be turned out of the way
Jer  And now the Lord the God of Israel has said of this town about which you say It is given into the hands of the king of Babylon by the sword and by need of food and by disease
Jer  See I will get them together from all the countries where I have sent them in my wrath and in the heat of my passion and in my bitter feeling and I will let them come back into this place where they may take their rest safely
Jer  And they will be my people and I will be their God
Jer  And I will give them one heart and one way so that they may go on in the worship of me for ever for their good and the good of their children after them
Jer  And I will make an eternal agreement with them that I will never give them up but ever do them good and I will put the fear of me in their hearts so that they will not go away from me
Jer  And truly I will take pleasure in doing them good and all my heart and soul will be given to planting them in this land in good faith
Jer  For the Lord has said As I have made all this great evil come on this people so I will send on them all the good which I said about them
Jer  And there will be trading in fields in this land of which you say It is a waste without man or beast it is given into the hands of the Chaldaeans
Jer  Men will get fields for money and put the business in writing stamping the papers and having them witnessed in the land of Benjamin and in the country round Jerusalem and in the towns of Judah and in the towns of the hillcountry and in the towns of the lowland and in the towns of the South for I will let their fate be changed says the Lord
Jer  Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the second time while he was still shut up in the place of the armed watchmen saying
Jer  These are the words of the Lord who is doing it the Lord who is forming it to make it certain the Lord is his name
Jer  Let your cry come to me and I will give you an answer and let you see great things and secret things of which you had no knowledge
Jer  For this is what the Lord the God of Israel has said about the houses of this town and the houses of the kings of Judah which have been broken down to make earthworks and 
Jer   and to make them full of the dead bodies of men whom I have put to death in my wrath and in my passion and because of whose evildoing I have kept my face covered from this town
Jer  See I will make it healthy and well again I will even make them well I will let them see peace and good faith in full measure
Jer  And I will let the fate of Judah and of Israel be changed building them up as at first
Jer  And I will make them clean from all their sin with which they have been sinning against me I will have forgiveness for all their sins with which they have been sinning against me and with which they have done evil against me
Jer  And this town will be to me for a name of joy for a praise and a glory before all the nations of the earth who hearing of all the good which I am doing for them will be shaking with fear because of all the good and the peace which I am doing for it
Jer  This is what the Lord has said There will again be sounding in this place of which you say It is a waste without man and without beast even in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem which are waste and unpeopled without man and without beast
Jer  Happy sounds the voice of joy the voice of the newlymarried man and the voice of the bride the voices of those who say Give praise to the Lord of armies for the Lord is good for his mercy is unchanging for ever the voices of those who go with praise into the house of the Lord For I will let the land come back to its first condition says the Lord
Jer  This is what the Lord of armies has said Again there will be in this place which is a waste without man and without beast and in all its towns a restingplace where the keepers of sheep will make their flocks take rest
Jer  In the towns of the hillcountry in the towns of the lowland and in the towns of the South and in the land of Benjamin and in the country round Jerusalem and in the towns of Judah the flocks will again go under the hand of him who is numbering them says the Lord
Jer  See the days are coming says the Lord when I will give effect to the good word which I have said about the people of Israel and the people of Judah
Jer  In those days and at that time I will let a Branch of righteousness come up for David and he will be a judge in righteousness in the land
Jer  In those days Judah will have salvation and Jerusalem will be safe and this is the name which will be given to her The Lord is our righteousness
Jer  For the Lord has said David will never be without a man to take his place on the seat of the kingdom of Israel
Jer  And the priests and the Levites will never be without a man to come before me offering burned offerings and perfumes and meal offerings and offerings of beasts at all times
Jer  And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah saying
Jer  The Lord has said If it is possible for my agreement of the day and the night to be broken so that day and night no longer come at their fixed times
Jer  Then my agreement with my servant David may be broken so that he no longer has a son to take his place on the seat of the kingdom and my agreement with the Levites the priests my servants
Jer  As it is not possible for the army of heaven to be numbered or the sand of the sea measured so will I make the seed of my servant David and the Levites my servants
Jer  And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah saying
Jer  Have you taken note of what these people have said The two families which the Lord took for himself he has given up This they say looking down on my people as being in their eyes no longer a nation
Jer  The Lord has said If I have not made day and night and if the limits of heaven and earth have not been fixed by me
Jer  Then I will give up caring for the seed of Jacob and of David my servant so that I will not take of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham Isaac and Jacob for I will let their fate be changed and will have mercy on them
Jer  The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms of the earth which were under his rule and all the peoples were fighting against Jerusalem and all its towns saying
Jer  The Lord the God of Israel has said Go and say to Zedekiah king of Judah This is what the Lord has said See I will give this town into the hands of the king of Babylon and he will have it burned with fire
Jer  And you will not get away from him but will certainly be taken and given up into his hands and you will see the king of Babylon eye to eye and he will have talk with you mouth to mouth and you will go to Babylon
Jer  But give ear to the word of the Lord O Zedekiah king of Judah this is what the Lord has said about you Death will not come to you by the sword
Jer  You will come to your end in peace and such burnings as they made for your fathers the earlier kings before you will be made for you and they will be weeping for you and saying Ah lord for I have said the word says the Lord
Jer  Then Jeremiah the prophet said all these things to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem
Jer  When the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the towns of Judah which had not been taken against Lachish and against Azekah for these were the last of the walled towns of Judah
Jer  The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord after King Zedekiah had made an agreement with all the people in Jerusalem to give news in public that servants were to be made free
Jer  That every man was to let his Hebrew manservant and his Hebrew servantgirl go free so that no one might make use of a Jew his countryman as a servant
Jer  And this was done by all the rulers and the people who had taken part in the agreement and every one let his manservant and his servantgirl go free not to be used as servants any longer they did so and let them go
Jer  But later they took back again the servants and the servantgirls whom they had let go free and put them again under the yoke as servants and servantgirls
Jer  For this reason the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying
Jer  The Lord the God of Israel has said I made an agreement with your fathers on the day when I took them out of Egypt out of the prisonhouse saying
Jer  At the end of seven years every man is to let go his countryman who is a Hebrew who has become yours for a price and has been your servant for six years you are to let him go free but your fathers gave no attention and did not give ear
Jer  And now turning away from evil you had done what is right in my eyes giving a public undertaking for every man to make his neighbour free and you had made an agreement before me in the house which is named by my name
Jer  But again you have put shame on my name and you have taken back every one his manservant and his servantgirl whom you had sent away free and you have put them under the yoke again to be your servants and servantgirls
Jer  And so the Lord has said You have not given ear to me and undertaken publicly every man to let loose his countryman and his neighbour see I undertake to let loose against you the sword and disease and need of food and I will send you wandering among all the kingdoms of the earth
Jer  And I will give the men who have gone against my agreement and have not given effect to the words of the agreement which they made before me when the ox was cut in two and they went between the parts of it
Jer  The rulers of Judah and the rulers of Jerusalem the unsexed servants and the priests and all the people of the land who went between the parts of the ox
Jer  Even these I will give up into the hands of their haters and into the hands of those who have designs against their lives and their dead bodies will become food for the birds of heaven and the beasts of the earth
Jer  And Zedekiah king of Judah and his rulers I will give into the hands of their haters and into the hands of those who have designs against their lives and into the hands of the king of Babylons army which has gone away from you
Jer  See I will give orders says the Lord and make them come back to this town and they will make war on it and take it and have it burned with fire and I will make the towns of Judah waste and unpeopled
Jer  The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah saying
Jer  Go into the house of the Rechabites and have talk with them and take them into the house of the Lord into one of the rooms and give them wine
Jer  Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah the son of Habazziniah and his brothers and all his sons and all the Rechabites
Jer  And I took them into the house of the Lord into the room of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah the man of God which was near the rulers room which was over the room of Maaseiah the son of Shallum the keeper of the door
Jer  And I put before the sons of the Rechabites basins full of wine and cups and I said to them Take some wine
Jer  But they said We will take no wine for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father gave us orders saying You are to take no wine you or your sons for ever
Jer  And you are to make no houses or put in seed or get vinegardens planted or have any but all your days you are to go on living in tents so that you may have a long life in the land where you are living as in a strange country
Jer  And we have kept the rules of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in everything which he gave us orders to do drinking no wine all our days we and our wives and our sons and our daughters
Jer  Building no houses for ourselves having no vinegardens or fields or seed
Jer  But we have been living in tents and have done everything which Jonadab our father gave us orders to do
Jer  But when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land we said Come let us go to Jerusalem away from the army of the Chaldaeans and from the army of the Aramaeans and so we are living in Jerusalem
Jer  Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah saying
Jer  This is what the Lord of armies the God of Israel has said Go and say to the men of Judah and the people of Jerusalem Is there no hope of teaching you to give ear to my words says the Lord
Jer  The orders which Jonadab the son of Rechab gave to his sons to take no wine are done and to this day they take no wine for they do the orders of their father but I have sent my words to you getting up early and sending them and you have not given ear to me
Jer  And I have sent you all my servants the prophets getting up early and sending them saying Come back now every man from his evil way and do better and go not after other gods to become their servants and you will go on living in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers but your ears have not been open and you have not given attention to me
Jer  Though the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have done the orders of their father which he gave them this people has not given ear to me
Jer  For this reason the Lord the God of armies the God of Israel has said See I will send on Judah and on all the people of Jerusalem all the evil which I said I would do to them because I sent my words to them but they did not give ear crying out to them but they gave no answer
Jer  But to the Rechabites Jeremiah said This is what the Lord of armies the God of Israel has said Because you have done the orders of Jonadab your father and have kept his rules and done everything as he gave you orders to do it
Jer  For this reason the Lord of armies the God of Israel has said Jonadab the son of Rechab will never be without a man to take his place before me
Jer  Now it came about in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah that this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying
Jer  Take a book and put down in it all the words I have said to you against Israel and against Judah and against all the nations from the day when my word came to you in the days of Josiah till this day
Jer  It may be that the people of Judah hearing of all the evil which it is my purpose to do to them will be turned every man from his evil ways so that they may have my forgiveness for their evildoing and their sin
Jer  Then Jeremiah sent for Baruch the son of Neriah and Baruch took down from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord which he had said to him writing them in a book
Jer  And Jeremiah gave orders to Baruch saying I am shut up and am not able to go into the house of the Lord
Jer  So you are to go reading there from the book which you have taken down from my mouth the words of the Lord in the hearing of the people in the Lords house on a day when they go without food and in the hearing of all the men of Judah who have come out from their towns
Jer  It may be that their prayer for grace will go up to the Lord and that every man will be turned from his evil ways for great is the wrath and the passion made clear by the Lord against this people
Jer  And Baruch the son of Neriah did as Jeremiah the prophet gave him orders to do reading from the book the words of the Lord in the Lords house
Jer  Now it came about in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah in the ninth month that it was given out publicly that all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the towns of Judah to Jerusalem were to keep from food before the Lord
Jer  Then Baruch gave a public reading of the words of Jeremiah from the book in the house of the Lord in the room of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe in the higher square as one goes in by the new doorway of the Lords house in the hearing of all the people
Jer  And Micaiah the son of Gemariah the son of Shaphan after hearing all the words of the Lord from the book
Jer  Went down to the kings house to the scribes room and all the rulers were seated there Elishama the scribe and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah and Elnathan the son of Achbor and Gemariah the son of Shaphan and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah and all the rulers
Jer  Then Micaiah gave them an account of all the words which had come to his ears when Baruch was reading the book to the people
Jer  So all the rulers sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah the son of Shelemiah the son of Cushi to Baruch saying Take in your hand the book from which you have been reading to the people and come So Baruch the son of Neriah took the book in his hand and came down to them
Jer  Then they said to him Be seated now and give us a reading from it So Baruch did so reading it to them
Jer  Now it came about that after hearing all the words they said to one another in fear We will certainly give the king an account of all these words
Jer  And questioning Baruch they said Say now how did you put all these words down in writing from his mouth
Jer  Then Baruch answering said He said all these things to me by word of mouth and I put them down with ink in the book
Jer  Then the rulers said to Baruch Go and put yourself in a safe place you and Jeremiah and let no man have knowledge of where you are
Jer  Then they went into the open square to the king but the book they put away in the room of Elishama the scribe and they gave the king an account of all the words
Jer  So the king sent Jehudi to get the book and he took it from the room of Elishama the scribe And Jehudi gave a reading of it in the hearing of the king and all the rulers who were by the kings side
Jer  Now the king was seated in the winter house and a fire was burning in the fireplace in front of him
Jer  And it came about that whenever Jehudi in his reading had got through three or four divisions the king cutting them with his penknife put them into the fire till all the book was burned up in the fire which was burning in the fireplace
Jer  But they had no fear and gave no signs of grief not the king or any of his servants after hearing all these words
Jer  And Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made a strong request to the king not to let the book be burned but he would not give ear to them
Jer  And the king gave orders to Jerahmeel the kings son and Seraiah the son of Azriel and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet but the Lord kept them safe
Jer  Then after the book in which Baruch had put down the words of Jeremiah had been burned by the king the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah saying
Jer  Take another book and put down in it all the words which were in the first book which Jehoiakim king of Judah put into the fire
Jer  And about Jehoiakim king of Judah you are to say This is what the Lord has said You have put this book into the fire saying Why have you put in it that the king of Babylon will certainly come causing the destruction of this land and putting an end to every man and beast in it
Jer  For this reason the Lord has said of Jehoiakim king of Judah He will have no son to take his place on the seat of David his dead body will be put out to undergo the heat of the day and the cold of the night
Jer  And I will send punishment on him and on his seed and on his servants for their evildoing I will send on them and on the people of Jerusalem and the men of Judah all the evil which I said against them but they did not give ear
Jer  Then Jeremiah took another book and gave it to Baruch the scribe the son of Neriah who put down in it from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which had been burned in the fire by Jehoiakim king of Judah and in addition a number of other words of the same sort
Jer  And Zedekiah the son of Josiah became king in place of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah
Jer  But he and his servants and the people of the land did not give ear to the words of the Lord which he said by Jeremiah the prophet
Jer  And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah saying Make prayer now to the Lord our God for us
Jer  Now Jeremiah was going about among the people for they had not put him in prison
Jer  And Pharaohs army had come out from Egypt and the Chaldaeans who were attacking Jerusalem hearing news of them went away from Jerusalem
Jer  Then the word of the Lord came to the prophet Jeremiah saying
Jer  The Lord the God of Israel has said This is what you are to say to the king of Judah who sent you to get directions from me See Pharaohs army which has come out to your help will go back to Egypt to their land
Jer  And the Chaldaeans will come back again and make war against this town and they will take it and put it on fire
Jer  The Lord has said Have no false hopes saying to yourselves The Chaldaeans will go away from us for they will not go away
Jer  For even if you had overcome all the army of the Chaldaeans fighting against you and there were only wounded men among them still they would get up every man in his tent and put this town on fire
Jer  And it came about that when the Chaldaean army outside Jerusalem had gone away for fear of Pharaohs army
Jer  Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin with the purpose of taking up his heritage there among the people
Jer  But when he was at the Benjamin door a captain of the watch named Irijah the son of Shelemiah the son of Hananiah who was stationed there put his hand on Jeremiah the prophet saying You are going to give yourself up to the Chaldaeans
Jer  Then Jeremiah said That is not true I am not going to the Chaldaeans But he would not give ear to him so Irijah made him prisoner and took him to the rulers
Jer  And the rulers were angry with Jeremiah and gave him blows and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe for they had made that the prison
Jer  So Jeremiah came into the hole of the prison under the arches and was there for a long time
Jer  Then King Zedekiah sent and got him out and the king questioning him secretly in his house said Is there any word from the Lord And Jeremiah said There is Then he said You will be given up into the hands of the king of Babylon
Jer  Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah What has been my sin against you or against your servants or against this people that you have put me in prison
Jer  Where now are your prophets who said to you The king of Babylon will not come against you and against this land
Jer  And now be pleased to give ear O my lord the king let my prayer for help come before you and do not make me go back to the house of Jonathan the scribe for fear that I may come to my death there
Jer  Then by the order of Zedekiah the king Jeremiah was put into the place of the armed watchmen and they gave him every day a cake of bread from the street of the breadmakers till all the bread in the town was used up So Jeremiah was kept in the place of the armed watchmen
Jer  Now it came to the ears of Shephatiah the son of Mattan and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur and Jucal the son of Shelemiah and Pashhur the son of Malchiah that Jeremiah had said to all the people
Jer  These are the words of the Lord Whoever goes on living in this town will come to his death by the sword or through need of food or by disease but whoever goes out to the Chaldaeans will keep his life out of the power of the attackers and be safe
Jer  The Lord has said This town will certainly be given into the hands of the army of the king of Babylon and he will take it
Jer  Then the rulers said to the king Let this man be put to death because he is putting fear into the hearts of the men of war who are still in the town and into the hearts of the people by saying such things to them this man is not working for the wellbeing of the people but for their damage
Jer  Then Zedekiah the king said See he is in your hands for the king was not able to do anything against them
Jer  So they took Jeremiah and put him into the waterhole of Malchiah the kings son in the place of the armed watchmen and they let Jeremiah down with cords And in the hole there was no water but wet earth and Jeremiah went down into the wet earth
Jer  Now it came to the ears of Ebedmelech the Ethiopian an unsexed servant in the kings house that they had put Jeremiah into the waterhole the king at that time being seated in the doorway of Benjamin
Jer  And Ebedmelech went out from the kings house and said to the king
Jer  My lord the king these men have done evil in all they have done to Jeremiah the prophet whom they have put into the waterhole and he will come to his death in the place where he is through need of food for there is no more bread in the town
Jer  Then the king gave orders to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian saying Take with you three men from here and get Jeremiah out of the waterhole before death overtakes him
Jer  So Ebedmelech took the men with him and went into the house of the king to the place where the clothing was kept and got from there old clothing and bits of old cloth and let them down by cords into the waterhole where Jeremiah was
Jer  And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah Put these bits of old cloth under your arms under the cords And Jeremiah did so
Jer  So pulling Jeremiah up with the cords they got him out of the waterhole and Jeremiah was kept in the place of the armed watchmen
Jer  Then King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and took him into the rulers doorway in the house of the Lord and the king said to Jeremiah I have a question to put to you keep nothing back from me
Jer  Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah If I give you the answer to your question will you not certainly put me to death and if I make a suggestion to you you will not give it a hearing
Jer  So King Zedekiah gave his oath to Jeremiah secretly saying By the living Lord who gave us our life I will not put you to death or give you up to these men who are desiring to take your life
Jer  Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah These are the words of the Lord the God of armies the God of Israel If you go out to the king of Babylons captains then you will have life and the town will not be burned with fire and you and your family will be kept from death
Jer  But if you do not go out to the king of Babylons captains then this town will be given into the hands of the Chaldaeans and they will put it on fire and you will not get away from them
Jer  And King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah I am troubled on account of the Jews who have gone over to the Chaldaeans for fear that they may give me up to them and they will put me to shame
Jer  But Jeremiah said They will not give you up be guided now by the word of the Lord as I have given it to you and it will be well for you and you will keep your life
Jer  But if you do not go out this is what the Lord has made clear to me
Jer  See all the rest of the women in the house of the king of Judah will be taken out to the king of Babylons captains and these women will say Your nearest friends have been false to you and have got the better of you they have made your feet go deep into the wet earth and they are turned away back from you
Jer  And they will take all your wives and your children out to the Chaldaeans and you will not get away out of their hands but will be taken by the hands of the king of Babylon and this town will be burned with fire
Jer  Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah Let no man have knowledge of these words and you will not be put to death
Jer  But if it comes to the ears of the rulers that I have been talking with you and they come and say to you Give us word now of what you have said to the king and what the king said to you keeping nothing back and we will not put you to death
Jer  Then you are to say to them I made my request to the king that he would not send me back to my death in Jonathans house
Jer  Then all the rulers came to Jeremiah questioning him and he gave them an answer in the words the king had given him orders to say So they said nothing more to him for the thing was not made public
Jer  So Jeremiah was kept in the place of the armed watchmen till the day when Jerusalem was taken
Jer  And it came about that when Jerusalem was taken in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah in the tenth month Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon with all his army came against Jerusalem shutting it in on every side
Jer  In the eleventh year of Zedekiah in the fourth month on the ninth day of the month the town was broken into
Jer  All the captains of the king of Babylon came in and took their places in the middle doorway of the town Nergalsharezer ruler of Sinmagir the Rabmag and Nebushazban the Rabsaris and all the captains of the king of Babylon
Jer  And when Zedekiah king of Judah and all the men of war saw it they went in flight from the town by night by the way of the kings garden through the doorway between the two walls and they went out by the Arabah
Jer  But the Chaldaean army went after them and overtook Zedekiah in the lowlands of Jericho and they made him a prisoner and took him up to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath to be judged by him
Jer  Then the king of Babylon put the sons of Zedekiah to death before his eyes in Riblah and the king of Babylon put to death all the great men of Judah
Jer  And more than this he put out Zedekiahs eyes and had him put in chains to take him away to Babylon
Jer  And the Chaldaeans put the kings house on fire as well as the houses of the people and had the walls of Jerusalem broken down
Jer  Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men took away to Babylon as prisoners all the rest of the workmen who were still in the town as well as those who had given themselves up to him and all the rest of the people
Jer  But Nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men let the poorest of the people who had nothing whatever go on living in the land of Judah and gave them vinegardens and fields at the same time
Jer  Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave orders about Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men saying
Jer  Take him and keep an eye on him and see that no evil comes to him but do with him whatever he says to you
Jer  So Nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men sent Nebushazban the Rabsaris and Nergalsharezer the Rabmag and all the chief captains of the king of Babylon
Jer  And they sent and took Jeremiah out of the place of the watchmen and gave him into the care of Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan to take him to his house so he was living among the people
Jer  Now the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah while he was shut up in the place of the armed watchmen saying
Jer  Go and say to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian This is what the Lord of armies the God of Israel has said See my words will come true for this town for evil and not for good they will come about before your eyes on that day
Jer  But I will keep you safe on that day says the Lord you will not be given into the hands of the men you are fearing
Jer  For I will certainly let you go free and you will not be put to the sword but your life will be given to you out of the hands of your attackers because you have put your faith in me says the Lord
Jer  The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord after Nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men had let him go from Ramah when he had taken him for he had been put in chains among all the prisoners of Jerusalem and Judah who were taken away prisoners to Babylon
Jer  And the captain of the armed men took Jeremiah and said to him The Lord your God gave word of the evil which was to come on this place
Jer   and the Lord has made it come and has done as he said because of your sin against the Lord in not giving ear to his voice and that is why this thing has come on you
Jer  Now see this day I am freeing you from the chains which are on your hands If it seems good to you to come with me to Babylon then come and I will keep an eye on you but if it does not seem good to you to come with me to Babylon then do not come see all the land is before you if it seems good and right to you to go on living in the land
Jer  Then go back to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan whom the king of Babylon has made ruler over the towns of Judah and make your livingplace with him among the people or go wherever it seems right to you to go So the captain of the armed men gave him food and some money and let him go
Jer  So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam in Mizpah and was living with him among the people who were still in the land
Jer  Now when it came to the ears of all the captains of the forces who were in the field and their men that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam ruler in the land and had put under his care the men and women and children all the poorest of the land those who had not been taken away to Babylon
Jer  Then they came to Gedaliah in Mizpah even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and Johanan the son of Kareah and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite they and their men
Jer  And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan took an oath to them and their men saying Have no fear of the servants of the Chaldaeans go on living in the land and become the servants of the king of Babylon and all will be well
Jer  As for me I will be living in Mizpah as your representative before the Chaldaeans who come to us but you are to get in your wine and summer fruits and oil and put them in your vessels and make livingplaces for yourselves in the towns which you have taken
Jer  In the same way when all the Jews who were in Moab and among the children of Ammon and in Edom and in all the countries had news that the king of Babylon had let Judah keep some of its people and that he had put over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan
Jer  Then all the Jews came back from all the places to which they had gone in flight and came to the land of Judah to Gedaliah to Mizpah and got in a great store of wine and summer fruit
Jer  Now Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces which were in the field came to Gedaliah in Mizpah
Jer  And said to him Has it come to your knowledge that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam put no faith in what they said
Jer  Then Johanan the son of Kareah said to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly Let me now go and put Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to death without anyones knowledge why let him take your life so that all the Jews who have come together to you may be sent in flight and the rest of the men of Judah come to an end
Jer  But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah You are not to do this for what you say about Ishmael is false
Jer  Now it came about in the seventh month that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama of the kings seed having with him ten men came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam in Mizpah and they had a meal together in Mizpah
Jer  Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him got up and attacking Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword put to death him whom the king of Babylon had made ruler over the land
Jer  And Ishmael put to death all the Jews who were with him even with Gedaliah at Mizpah and the Chaldaean men of war
Jer  Now on the second day after he had put Gedaliah to death when no one had knowledge of it
Jer  Some people came from Shechem from Shiloh and Samaria eighty men with the hair of their faces cut off and their clothing out of order and with cuts on their bodies and in their hands meal offerings and perfumes which they were taking to the house of the Lord
Jer  And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah with the purpose of meeting them weeping on his way and it came about that when he was face to face with them he said Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam
Jer  And when they came inside the town Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the men who were with him put them to death and put their bodies into a deep hole
Jer  But there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael Do not put us to death for we have secret stores in the country of grain and oil and honey So he did not put them to death with their countrymen
Jer  Now the hole into which Ishmael had put the dead bodies of the men whom he had put to death was the great hole which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah made it full of the bodies of those who had been put to death
Jer  Then Ishmael took away as prisoners all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah the kings daughters and all the people still in Mizpah whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men had put under the care of Gedaliah the son of Ahikam Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took them away prisoners with the purpose of going over to the children of Ammon
Jer  But when Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the armed forces who were with him had news of all the evil which Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done
Jer  They took their men and went out to make war on Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and they came face to face with him by the great waters in Gibeon
Jer  Now when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces with him then they were glad
Jer  And all the people whom Ishmael had taken away prisoners from Mizpah turning round came back and went to Johanan the son of Kareah
Jer  But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah got away from Johanan with eight men and went to the children of Ammon
Jer  Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces who were with him took all the rest of the people whom Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had made prisoners after he had put to death Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the people from Mizpah that is the men of war and the women and the children and the unsexed servants whom he had taken back with him from Gibeon
Jer  And they went and were living in the restingplace of Chimham which is near Bethlehem on the way into Egypt
Jer  Because of the Chaldaeans for they were in fear of them because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had put to death Gedaliah the son of Ahikam whom the king of Babylon had made ruler over the land
Jer  Then all the captains of the forces and Johanan the son of Kareah and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah and all the people from the least to the greatest came near
Jer  And said to Jeremiah the prophet Let our request come before you and make prayer for us to the Lord your God even for this small band of us for we are only a small band out of what was a great number as your eyes may see
Jer  That the Lord your God may make clear to us the way in which we are to go and what we are to do
Jer  Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them I have given ear to you see I will make prayer to the Lord your God as you have said and it will be that whatever the Lord may say in answer to you I will give you word of it keeping nothing back
Jer  Then they said to Jeremiah May the Lord be a true witness against us in good faith if we do not do everything which the Lord your God sends you to say to us
Jer  If it is good or if it is evil we will be guided by the voice of the Lord our God to whom we are sending you so that it may be well for us when we give ear to the voice of the Lord our God
Jer  And it came about that after ten days the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah
Jer  And he sent for Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces who were still with him and all the people from the least to the greatest
Jer  And said to them These are the words of the Lord the God of Israel to whom you sent me to put your request before him
Jer  If you still go on living in the land then I will go on building you up and not pulling you down planting you and not uprooting you for my purpose of doing evil to you has been changed
Jer  Have no fear of the king of Babylon of whom you are now in fear have no fear of him says the Lord for I am with you to keep you safe and to give you salvation from his hands
Jer  And I will have mercy on you so that he may have mercy on you and let you go back to your land
Jer  But if you say We have no desire to go on living in this land and do not give ear to the voice of the Lord your God
Jer  Saying No but we will go into the land of Egypt where we will not see war or be hearing the sound of the horn or be in need of food there we will make our livingplace
Jer  Then give ear now to the word of the Lord O you last of Judah the Lord of armies the God of Israel has said If your minds are fixed on going into Egypt and stopping there
Jer  Then it will come about that the sword which is the cause of your fear will overtake you there in the land of Egypt and need of food which you are fearing will go after you there in Egypt and there death will come to you
Jer  Such will be the fate of all the men whose minds are fixed on going into Egypt and stopping there they will come to their end by the sword by being short of food and by disease not one of them will keep his life or get away from the evil which I will send on them
Jer  For this is what the Lord of armies the God of Israel has said As my wrath and passion have been let loose on the people of Jerusalem so will my passion be let loose on you when you go into Egypt and you will become an oath and a cause of wonder and a curse and a name of shame and you will never see this place again
Jer  The Lord has said about you O last of Judah Go not into Egypt be certain that I have given witness to you this day
Jer  For you have been acting with deceit in your hearts for you sent me to the Lord your God saying Make prayer for us to the Lord our God and give us word of everything he may say and we will do it
Jer  And this day I have made it clear to you and you have not given ear to the voice of the Lord your God in anything for which he has sent me to you
Jer  And now be certain that you will come to your end by the sword and by being short of food and by disease in the place to which you are pleased to go for a livingplace
Jer  And it came about that when Jeremiah had come to the end of giving all the people the words of the Lord their God which the Lord their God had sent him to say to them even all these words
Jer  Then Azariah the son of Hoshaiah and Johanan the son of Kareah and all the men of pride said to Jeremiah You have said what is false the Lord our God has not sent you to say You are not to go into the land of Egypt and make your livingplace there
Jer  But Baruch the son of Neriah is moving you against us to give us up into the hands of the Chaldaeans so that they may put us to death and take us away prisoners into Babylon
Jer  So Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces and all the people did not give ear to the order of the Lord that they were to go on living in the land of Judah
Jer  But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces took all the rest of Judah who had come back into the land of Judah from all the nations where they had been forced to go
Jer  The men and the women and the children and the kings daughters and every person whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men had put under the care of Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan and Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch the son of Neriah
Jer  And they came into the land of Egypt for they did not give ear to the voice of the Lord and they came to Tahpanhes
Jer  Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes saying
Jer  Take in your hand some great stones and put them in a safe place in the paste in the brickwork which is at the way into Pharaohs house in Tahpanhes before the eyes of the men of Judah
Jer  And say to them This is what the Lord of armies the God of Israel has said See I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon my servant and he will put the seat of his kingdom on these stones which have been put in a safe place here by you and his tent will be stretched over them
Jer  And he will come and overcome the land of Egypt those who are for death will be put to death those who are to be prisoners will be made prisoners and those who are for the sword will be given to the sword
Jer  And he will put a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt and they will be burned by him and he will make Egypt clean as a keeper of sheep makes clean his clothing and he will go out from there in peace
Jer  And the stone pillars of Bethshemesh in the land of Egypt will be broken by him and the houses of the gods of Egypt burned with fire
Jer  The word which came to Jeremiah about all the Jews who were living in the land of Egypt in Migdol and at Tahpanhes and at Noph and in the country of Pathros saying
Jer  The Lord of armies the God of Israel has said You have seen all the evil which I have sent on Jerusalem and on all the towns of Judah and now this day they are waste and unpeopled
Jer  Because of the evil which they have done moving me to wrath by burning perfumes in worship to other gods who were not their gods or yours or the gods of their fathers
Jer  And I sent all my servants the prophets to you getting up early and sending them saying Do not do this disgusting thing which is hated by me
Jer  But they gave no attention and their ears were not open so that they might be turned from their evildoing and from burning perfume to other gods
Jer  Because of this my passion and my wrath were let loose burning in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem and they are waste and unpeopled as at this day
Jer  So now the Lord the God of armies the God of Israel has said Why are you doing this great evil against yourselves causing every man and woman little child and baby at the breast among you in Judah to be cut off till not one is still living
Jer  Moving me to wrath with the work of your hands burning perfumes to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have gone to make a place for yourselves so that you may become a curse and a name of shame among all the nations of the earth
Jer  Have you no memory of the evildoing of your fathers and the evildoing of the kings of Judah and the evildoing of their wives and the evil which you yourselves have done and the evil which your wives have done in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem
Jer  Even to this day their hearts are not broken and they have no fear and have not gone in the way of my law or of my rules which I gave to you and to your fathers
Jer  So this is what the Lord of armies the God of Israel has said See my face will be turned against you for evil for the cutting off of all Judah
Jer  And I will take the last of Judah whose minds are fixed on going into the land of Egypt and stopping there and they will all come to their end falling in the land of Egypt by the sword and by being short of food and by disease death will overtake them from the least to the greatest death by the sword and by need of food they will become an oath and a cause of wonder and a curse and a name of shame
Jer  For I will send punishment on those who are living in the land of Egypt as I have sent punishment on Jerusalem by the sword and by need of food and by disease
Jer  So that not one of the rest of Judah who have gone into the land of Egypt and are living there will get away or keep his life to come back to the land of Judah where they are hoping to come back and be living again for not one will come back but only those who are able to get away
Jer  Then all the men who had knowledge that their wives were burning perfumes to other gods and all the women who were present a great meeting answering Jeremiah said
Jer  As for the word which you have said to us in the name of the Lord we will not give ear to you
Jer  But we will certainly do every word which has gone out of our mouths burning perfumes to the queen of heaven and draining out drink offerings to her as we did we and our fathers and our kings and our rulers in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem for then we had food enough and did well and saw no evil
Jer  But from the time when we gave up burning perfumes to the queen of heaven and draining out drink offerings to her we have been in need of all things and have been wasted by the sword and by need of food
Jer  And the women said When we were burning perfumes to the queen of heaven and draining out drink offerings to her did we make cakes in her image and give her our drink offerings without the knowledge of our husbands
Jer  Then Jeremiah said to all the people to the men and women and all the people who had given him that answer
Jer  The perfumes which you have been burning in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem you and your fathers and your kings and your rulers and the people of the land had the Lord no memory of them and did he not keep them in mind
Jer  And the Lord was no longer able to put up with the evil of your doings and the disgusting things you did and because of this your land has become a waste and a cause of wonder and a curse with no one living in it as at this day
Jer  Because you have been burning perfumes and sinning against the Lord and have not given ear to the voice of the Lord or gone in the way of his law or his rules or his orders for this reason this evil has come on you as it is today
Jer  Further Jeremiah said to all the people and all the women Give ear to the word of the Lord all those of Judah who are living in Egypt
Jer  This is what the Lord of armies the God of Israel has said You women have said with your mouths and with your hands you have done what you said We will certainly give effect to the oaths we have made to have perfumes burned to the queen of heaven and drink offerings drained out to her then give effect to your oaths and do them
Jer  And now give ear to the word of the Lord all you of Judah who are living in the land of Egypt Truly I have taken an oath by my great name says the Lord that my name is no longer to be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt saying By the life of the Lord God
Jer  See I am watching over them for evil and not for good all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt will be wasted by the sword and by need of food till there is an end of them
Jer  And those who get away safe from the sword will come back from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah a very small number and all the rest of Judah who have gone into the land of Egypt and are living there will see whose word has effect mine or theirs
Jer  And this will be the sign to you says the Lord that I will give you punishment in this place so that you may see that my words will certainly have effect against you for evil
Jer  The Lord has said See I will give up Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hands of those who are fighting against him and desiring to take his life as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hands of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon his hater who had designs against his life

Lam  Let us make search and put our ways to the test turning again to the Lord
Lam  Lifting up our hearts with our hands to God in the heavens
Lam  We have done wrong and gone against your law we have not had your forgiveness
Lam  Covering yourself with wrath you have gone after us cutting us off without pity
Lam  Covering yourself with a cloud so that prayer may not get through
Lam  You have made us like waste and that for which there is no use among the peoples
Lam  The mouths of all our haters are open wide against us
Lam  Fear and deep waters have come on us wasting and destruction
Lam  Rivers of water are running down from my eyes for the destruction of the daughter of my people
Lam  My eyes are streaming without stopping they have no rest
Lam  Till the Lords eye is turned on me till he sees my trouble from heaven

Lam  They who are against me without cause have gone hard after me as if I was a bird
Lam  They have put an end to my life in the prison stoning me with stones
Lam  Waters were flowing over my head I said I am cut off
Lam  I was making prayer to your name O Lord out of the lowest prison
Lam  My voice came to you let not your ear be shut to my breathing to my cry
Lam  You came near in the day when I made my prayer to you you said Have no fear
Lam  O Lord you have taken up the cause of my soul you have made my life safe
Lam  O Lord you have seen my wrong be judge in my cause
Lam  You have seen all the evil rewards they have sent on me and all their designs against me
Lam  Their bitter words have come to your ears O Lord and all their designs against me
Lam  The lips of those who came up against me and their thoughts against me all the day
Lam  Take note of them when they are seated and when they get up I am their song
Lam  You will give them their reward O Lord answering to the work of their hands
Lam  You will let their hearts be covered over with your curse on them
Lam  You will go after them in wrath and put an end to them from under the heavens of the Lord
Lam  How dark has the gold become how changed the best gold the stones of the holy place are dropping out at the top of every street
Lam  The valued sons of Zion whose price was the best gold are looked on as vessels of earth the work of the hands of the potter
Lam  Even the beasts of the waste land have full breasts they give milk to their young ones the daughter of my people has become cruel like the ostriches in the waste land
Lam  The tongue of the child at the breast is fixed to the roof of his mouth for need of drink the young children are crying out for bread and no man gives it to them
Lam  Those who were used to feasting on delicate food are wasted in the streets those who as children were dressed in purple are stretched out on the dust
Lam  For the punishment of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of Sodom which was overturned suddenly without any hand falling on her
Lam  Her holy ones were cleaner than snow they were whiter than milk their bodies were redder than corals their form was as the sapphire
Lam  Their face is blacker than night in the streets no one has knowledge of them their skin is hanging on their bones they are dry they have become like wood
Lam  Those who have been put to the sword are better off than those whose death is caused by need of food for these come to death slowly burned up like the fruit of the field
Lam  The hands of kindhearted women have been boiling their children they were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people
Lam  The Lord has given full effect to his passion he has let loose his burning wrath he has made a fire in Zion causing the destruction of its bases
Lam  To the kings of the earth and to all the people of the world it did not seem possible that the attackers and the haters would go into the doors of Jerusalem
Lam  It is because of the sins of her prophets and the evildoing of her priests by whom the blood of the upright has been drained out in her
Lam  They are wandering like blind men in the streets they are made unclean with blood so that their robes may not be touched by men
Lam  Away unclean they were crying out to them Away away let there be no touching when they went away in flight and wandering men said among the nations There is no further restingplace for them
Lam  The face of the Lord has sent them in all directions he will no longer take care of them they had no respect for the priests they gave no honour to the old men
Lam  Our eyes are still wasting away in looking for our false help we have been watching for a nation unable to give salvation
Lam  They go after our steps so that we may not go in our streets our end is near our days are numbered for our end has come
Lam  Those who went after us were quicker than the eagles of the heaven driving us before them on the mountains waiting secretly for us in the waste land
Lam  Our breath of life he on whom the holy oil was put was taken in their holes of whom we said Under his shade we will be living among the nations
Lam  Have joy and be glad O daughter of Edom living in the land of Uz the cup will be given to you in your turn and you will be overcome with wine and your shame will be seen
Lam  The punishment of your evildoing is complete O daughter of Zion never again will he take you away as a prisoner he will give you the reward of your evildoing O daughter of Edom he will let your sin be uncovered
Lam  Keep in mind O Lord what has come to us take note and see our shame
Lam  Our heritage is given up to men of strange lands our houses to those who are not our countrymen
Lam  We are children without fathers our mothers are like widows
Lam  We give money for a drink of water we get our wood for a price
Lam  Our attackers are on our necks overcome with weariness we have no rest
Lam  We have given our hands to the Egyptians and to the Assyrians so that we might have enough bread
Lam  Our fathers were sinners and are dead and the weight of their evildoing is on us
Lam  Servants are ruling over us and there is no one to make us free from their hands
Lam  We put our lives in danger to get our bread because of the sword of the waste land
Lam  Our skin is heated like an oven because of our burning heat from need of food
Lam  They took by force the women in Zion the virgins in the towns of Judah
Lam  Their hands put princes to death by hanging the faces of old men were not honoured
Lam  The young men were crushing the grain and the boys were falling under the wood
Lam  The old men are no longer seated in the doorway and the music of the young men has come to an end
Lam  The joy of our hearts is ended our dancing is changed into sorrow
Lam  The crown has been taken from our head sorrow is ours for we are sinners
Lam  Because of this our hearts are feeble for these things our eyes are dark
Lam  Because of the mountain of Zion which is a waste jackals go over it
Lam  You O Lord are seated as King for ever the seat of your power is eternal
Lam  Why have we gone from your memory for ever why have you been turned away from us for so long
Lam  Make us come back to you O Lord and let us be turned make our days new again as in the past
Lam  But you have quite given us up you are full of wrath against us
Eze  Now it came about in the thirtieth year in the fourth month on the fifth day of the month while I was by the river Chebar among those who had been made prisoners that the heavens were made open and I saw visions of God
Eze  On the fifth day of the month in the fifth year after King Jehoiachin had been made a prisoner
Eze  The word of the Lord came to me Ezekiel the priest the son of Buzi in the land of the Chaldaeans by the river Chebar and the hand of the Lord was on me there
Eze  And looking I saw a stormwind coming out of the north a great cloud with flames of fire coming after one another and a bright light shining round about it and in the heart of it was something coloured like electrum
Eze  And in the heart of it were the forms of four living beings And this was what they were like they had the form of a man
Eze  And every one had four faces and every one of them had four wings
Eze  And their feet were straight feet and the under sides of their feet were like the feet of oxen and they were shining like polished brass
Eze  And they had the hands of a man under their wings the four of them had faces on their four sides
Eze  They went without turning every one went straight forward
Eze  As for the form of their faces they had the face of a man and the four of them had the face of a lion on the right side and the four of them had the face of an ox on the left side and the four of them had the face of an eagle
Eze  And their wings were separate at the top two of the wings of every one were joined one to another and two were covering their bodies
Eze  Every one of them went straight forward wherever the spirit was to go they went they went on without turning
Eze  And between the living beings it was like burning coals of fire as if flames were going one after the other between the living beings and the fire was bright and out of the fire went thunderflames
Eze  And the living beings went out and came back as quickly as a thunderflame
Eze  Now while I was looking at the four living beings I saw one wheel on the earth by the side of the living beings for the four of them
Eze  The form of the wheels and their work was like a beryl the four of them had the same form and design and they were like a wheel inside a wheel
Eze  The four of them went straight forward without turning to one side
Eze  And I saw that they had edges and their edges even of the four were full of eyes round about
Eze  And when the living beings went on the wheels went by their side and when the living beings were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up
Eze  Wherever the spirit was to go they went and the wheels were lifted up by their side for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels
Eze  When these went on the others went and when these came to rest the others came to rest and when these were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up by their side for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels
Eze  And over the heads of the living beings there was the form of an arch looking like ice stretched out over their heads on high
Eze  Under the arch their wings were straight one stretched out to another every one had two wings covering their bodies on this side and two covering their bodies on that side
Eze  And when they went the sound of their wings was like the sound of great waters to my ears like the voice of the Ruler of all a sound like the rushing of an army when they came to rest they let down their wings
Eze  And there was a voice from the top of the arch which was over their heads when they came to rest they let down their wings
Eze  And on the top of the arch which was over their heads was the form of a kings seat like a sapphire stone and on the form of the seat was the form of a man seated on it on high
Eze  And I saw it coloured like electrum with the look of fire in it and round it going up from what seemed to be the middle of his body and going down from what seemed to be the middle of his body I saw what was like fire and there was a bright light shining round him
Eze  Like the bow in the cloud on a day of rain so was the light shining round him And this is what the glory of the Lord was like And when I saw it I went down on my face and the voice of one talking came to my ears
Eze  And he said to me Son of man get up on your feet so that I may say words to you
Eze  And at his words the spirit came into me and put me on my feet and his voice came to my ears
Eze  And he said to me Son of man I am sending you to the children of Israel to an uncontrolled nation which has gone against me they and their fathers have been sinners against me even to this very day
Eze  And the children are hard and stiffhearted I am sending you to them and you are to say to them These are the words of the Lord
Eze  And they if they give ear to you or if they do not give ear for they are an uncontrolled people will see that there has been a prophet among them
Eze  And you son of man have no fear of them or of their words even if sharp thorns are round you and you are living among scorpions have no fear of their words and do not be overcome by their looks for they are an uncontrolled people
Eze  And you are to give them my words if they give ear to you or if they do not for they are uncontrolled
Eze  But you son of man give ear to what I say to you and do not be uncontrolled like that uncontrolled people let your mouth be open and take what I give you
Eze  And looking I saw a hand stretched out to me and I saw the roll of a book in it
Eze  And he put it open before me and it had writing on the front and on the back words of grief and sorrow and trouble were recorded in it
Eze  And he said to me Son of man take this roll for your food and go and say my words to the children of Israel
Eze  And on my opening my mouth he made me take the roll as food
Eze  And he said to me Son of man let your stomach make a meal of it and let your inside be full of this roll which I am giving you Then I took it and it was sweet as honey in my mouth
Eze  And he said to me Son of man go now to the children of Israel and say my words to them
Eze  For you are not sent to a people whose talk is strange and whose language is hard but to the children of Israel
Eze  Not to a number of peoples whose talk is strange and whose language is hard and whose words are not clear to you Truly if I sent you to them they would give ear to you
Eze  But the children of Israel will not give ear to you for they have no mind to give ear to me for all the children of Israel have a hard brow and a stiff heart
Eze  See I have made your face hard against their faces and your brow hard against their brows
Eze  Like a diamond harder than rock I have made your brow have no fear of them and do not be overcome by their looks for they are an uncontrolled people
Eze  Then he said to me Son of man take into your heart all my words which I am about to say to you and let your ears be open to them
Eze  And go now to those who have been taken away as prisoners to the children of your people and say to them This is what the Lord has said if they give ear or if they do not
Eze  Then I was lifted up by the wind and at my back the sound of a great rushing came to my ears when the glory of the Lord was lifted up from his place
Eze  And there was the sound of the wings of the living beings touching one another and the sound of the wheels at their side the sound of a great rushing
Eze  And the wind lifting me up took me away and I went in the heat of my spirit and the hand of the Lord was strong on me
Eze  Then I came to those who had been taken away as prisoners who were at Telabib by the river Chebar and I was seated among them full of wonder for seven days
Eze  And at the end of seven days the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man I have made you a watchman for the children of Israel so give ear to the word of my mouth and give them word from me of their danger
Eze  When I say to the evildoer Death will certainly be your fate and you give him no word of it and say nothing to make clear to the evildoer the danger of his evil way so that he may be safe that same evil man will come to death in his evildoing but I will make you responsible for his blood
Eze  But if you give the evildoer word of his danger and he is not turned from his sin or from his evil way death will overtake him in his evildoing but your life will be safe
Eze  Again when an upright man turning away from his righteousness does evil and I put a cause of falling in his way death will overtake him because you have given him no word of his danger death will overtake him in his evildoing and there will be no memory of the upright acts which he has done but I will make you responsible for his blood
Eze  But if you say to the upright man that he is not to do evil he will certainly keep his life because he took note of your word and your life will be safe
Eze  And the hand of the Lord was on me there and he said Get up and go out into the valley and there I will have talk with you
Eze  Then I got up and went out into the valley and I saw the glory of the Lord resting there as I had seen it by the river Chebar and I went down on my face
Eze  Then the spirit came into me and put me on my feet and he had talk with me and said to me Go and keep yourself shut up inside your house
Eze  But see O son of man I will put bands on you prisoning you in them and you will not go out among them
Eze  And I will make your tongue fixed to the roof of your mouth so that you have no voice and may not make protests to them for they are an uncontrolled people
Eze  But when I have talk with you I will make your mouth open and you are to say to them This is what the Lord has said Let the hearer give ear and as for him who will not let him keep his ears shut for they are an uncontrolled people
Eze  And you son of man take a back and put it before you and on it make a picture of a town even Jerusalem
Eze  And make an attack on it shutting it in building strong places against it and making high an earthwork against it and put up tents against it placing engines all round it for smashing down its walls
Eze  And take a flat iron plate and put it for a wall of iron between you and the town and let your face be turned to it and it will be shut in and you will make an attack on it This will be a sign to the children of Israel
Eze  Then stretching yourself out on your left side take the sin of the children of Israel on yourself for as long as you are stretched out so long will the sin of the children of Israel be on you
Eze  For I have had the years of their sin measured for you by a number of days even three hundred and ninety days and you will take on yourself the sin of the children of Israel
Eze  And when these days are ended turning on your right side you are to take on yourself the sin of the children of Judah forty days a day for a year I have had it fixed for you
Eze  And let your face be turned to where Jerusalem is shut in with your arm uncovered and be a prophet against it
Eze  And see I will put bands on you and you will be stretched out without turning from one side to the other till the days of your attack are ended
Eze  And take for yourself wheat and barley and different sorts of grain and put them in one vessel and make bread for yourself from them all the days when you are stretched on your side it will be your food
Eze  And you are to take your food by weight twenty shekels a day you are to take it at regular times
Eze  And you are to take water by measure the sixth part of a hin you are to take it at regular times
Eze  And let your food be barley cakes cooking it before their eyes with the waste which comes out of a man
Eze  And the Lord said Even so the children of Israel will have unclean bread for their food among the nations where I am driving them
Eze  Then I said Ah Lord see my soul has never been unclean and I have never taken as my food anything which has come to a natural death or has been broken by beasts from the time when I was young even till now no disgusting flesh has ever come into my mouth
Eze  Then he said to me See I have given you cows waste in place of mans waste and you will make your bread ready on it
Eze  And he said to me Son of man see I will take away from Jerusalem her necessary bread they will take their bread by weight and with care measuring out their drinkingwater with fear and wonder
Eze  So that they may be in need of bread and water and be wondering at one another wasting away in their sin
Eze  And you son of man take a sharp sword using it like a haircutters blade and making it go over your head and the hair of your chin and take scales for separating the hair by weight
Eze  You are to have a third part burned with fire inside the town when the days of the attack are ended and a third part you are to take and give blows with the sword round about it and give a third part for the wind to take away and let loose a sword after them
Eze  And take from them a small number of hairs folding them in your skirts
Eze  And again take some of these and put them in the fire burning them up in the fire and say to all the children of Israel
Eze  This is what the Lord has said This is Jerusalem I have put her among the nations and countries are round her on every side
Eze  And she has gone against my orders by doing evil more than the nations and against my rules more than the countries round her for they have given up my orders and as for my rules they have not gone in the way of them
Eze  For this cause the Lord has said Because you have been more uncontrolled than the nations round about you and have not been guided by my rules or kept my orders but have kept the orders of the nations round about you
Eze  For this cause the Lord has said See I even I am against you and I will be judging among you before the eyes of the nations
Eze  And I will do in you what I have not done and will not do again because of all your disgusting ways
Eze  For this cause fathers will take their sons for food among you and sons will make a meal of their fathers and I will be judge among you and all the rest of you I will send away to every wind
Eze  For this cause by my life says the Lord because you have made my holy place unclean with all your hated things and all your disgusting ways you will become disgusting to me my eye will have no mercy and I will have no pity
Eze  A third of you will come to death from disease wasting away among you through need of food a third will be put to the sword round about you and a third I will send away to every wind letting loose a sword after them
Eze  So my wrath will be complete and my passion will come to rest on them and they will be certain that I the Lord have given the word of decision when my wrath against them is complete
Eze  And I will make you a waste and a name of shame among the nations round about you in the eyes of everyone who goes by
Eze  And you will be a name of shame and a cause of bitter words an example and a wonder to the nations round about you when I give effect to my judging among you in wrath and in passion and in burning protests I the Lord have said it
Eze  When I send on you the evil arrows of disease causing destruction which I will send to put an end to you and further I will take away your necessary food
Eze  And I will send on you need of food and evil beasts and they will be a cause of loss to you and disease and violent death will go through you and I will send the sword on you I the Lord have said it
Eze  And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man let your face be turned to the mountains of Israel and be a prophet to them and say
Eze  You mountains of Israel give ear to the words of the Lord this is what the Lord has said to the mountains and the hills to the waterways and the valleys See I even I am sending on you a sword for the destruction of your high places
Eze  And your altars will be made waste and your sunimages will be broken and I will have your dead men placed before your images
Eze  And I will put the dead bodies of the children of Israel in front of their images sending your bones in all directions about your altars
Eze  In all your livingplaces the towns will become broken walls and the high places made waste so that your altars may be broken down and made waste and your images broken and ended and so that your sunimages may be cut down and your works rubbed out
Eze  And the dead will be falling down among you and you will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  But still I will keep a small band safe from the sword among the nations when you are sent wandering among the countries
Eze  And those of you who are kept safe will have me in mind among the nations where they have been taken away as prisoners how I sent punishment on their hearts which were untrue to me and on their eyes which were turned to their false gods and they will be full of hate for themselves because of the evil things which they have done in all their disgusting ways
Eze  And they will be certain that I am the Lord not for nothing did I say that I would do this evil to them
Eze  This is what the Lord has said Give blows with your hand stamping with your foot and say O sorrow because of all the evil and disgusting ways of the children of Israel for death will overtake them by the sword and through need of food and by disease
Eze  He who is far away will come to his death by disease he who is near will be put to the sword he who is shut up will come to his death through need of food and I will give full effect to my passion against them
Eze  And you will be certain that I am the Lord when their dead men are stretched among their images round about their altars on every high hill on all the tops of the mountains and under every branching tree and under every thick oaktree the places where they made sweet smells to all their images
Eze  And my hand will be stretched out against them making the land waste and unpeopled from the waste land to Riblah through all their livingplaces and they will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  And you son of man say This is what the Lord has said to the land of Israel An end has come the end has come on the four quarters of the land
Eze  Now the end has come on you and I will send my wrath on you judging you for your ways I will send punishment on you for all your disgusting acts
Eze  My eye will not have mercy on you and I will have no pity but I will send the punishment of your ways on you and your disgusting works will be among you and you will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  This is what the Lord has said An evil even one evil see it is coming
Eze  An end has come the end has come see it is coming on you
Eze  The crowning time has come on you O people of the land the time has come the day is near the day will not be slow in coming it will not keep back
Eze  Now in a little time I will let loose my passion on you and give full effect to my wrath against you judging you for your ways and sending punishment on you for all your disgusting works
Eze  My eye will not have mercy and I will have no pity I will send on you the punishment of your ways and your disgusting works will be among you and you will see that I am the Lord who gives punishment
Eze  See the day see it is coming the crowning time has gone out the twisted way is flowering pride has put out buds
Eze  Violent behaviour has been lifted up into a rod of evil it will not be slow in coming it will not keep back
Eze  The time has come the day is near let not him who gives a price for goods be glad or him who gets the price have sorrow
Eze  For the trader will not go back to the things for which he had his price even while he is still living
Eze  And he who has given a price for goods will not get them for my wrath is on all of them
Eze  Outside is the sword and inside disease and need of food he who is in the open country will be put to the sword he who is in the town will come to his end through need of food and disease
Eze  And those of them who get away safely will go and be in the secret places like the doves of the valleys all of them will come to death every one in his sin
Eze  All hands will be feeble and all knees without strength like water
Eze  And they will put haircloth round them and deep fear will be covering them and shame will be on all faces and the hair gone from all their heads
Eze  They will put out their silver into the streets and their gold will be as an unclean thing their silver and their gold will not be able to keep them safe in the day of the wrath of the Lord they will not get their desire or have food for their need because it has been the cause of their falling into sin
Eze  As for their beautiful ornament they had put it on high and had made the images of their disgusting and hated things in it for this cause I have made it an unclean thing to them
Eze  And I will give it into the hands of men from strange lands who will take it by force and to the evildoers of the earth to have for themselves and they will make it unholy
Eze  And my face will be turned away from them and they will make my secret place unholy violent men will go into it and make it unholy
Eze  Make the chain for the land is full of crimes of blood and the town is full of violent acts
Eze  For this reason I will send the worst of the nations and they will take their houses for themselves I will make the pride of their strength come to an end and their holy places will be made unclean
Eze  Shaking fear is coming and they will be looking for peace and there will be no peace
Eze  Destruction will come on destruction and one story after another and the vision of the prophet will be shamed and knowledge of the law will come to an end among the priests and wisdom among the old
Eze  The king will give himself up to sorrow and the ruler will be clothed with wonder and the hands of the people of the land will be troubled I will give them punishment for their ways judging them as it is right for them to be judged and they will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  Now in the sixth year in the sixth month on the fifth day of the month when I was in my house and the responsible men of Judah were seated before me the hand of the Lord came on me there
Eze  And looking I saw a form like fire from the middle of his body and down there was fire and up from the middle of his body a sort of shining like electrum
Eze  And he put out the form of a hand and took me by the hair of my head and the wind lifting me up between the earth and the heaven took me in the visions of God to Jerusalem to the way into the inner door facing to the north where was the seat of the image of envy
Eze  And I saw the glory of the Lord there as in the vision which I saw in the valley
Eze  Then he said to me Son of man now let your eyes be lifted up in the direction of the north and on looking in the direction of the north to the north of the doorway of the altar I saw this image of envy by the way in
Eze  And he said to me Son of man do you see what they are doing even the very disgusting things which the children of Israel are doing here causing me to go far away from my holy place but you will see other most disgusting things
Eze  And he took me to the door of the open place and looking I saw a hole in the wall
Eze  And he said to me Son of man make a hole in the wall and after making a hole in the wall I saw a door
Eze  And he said to me Go in and see the evil and disgusting things which they are doing here
Eze  So I went in and saw and there every sort of living thing which goes flat on the earth and unclean beasts and all the images of the children of Israel were pictured round about on the wall
Eze  And before them seventy of the responsible men of the children of Israel had taken their places every man with a vessel for burning perfumes in his hand and in the middle of them was Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan and a cloud of smoke went up from the burning perfume
Eze  And he said to me Son of man have you seen what the responsible men of the children of Israel do in the dark every man in his room of pictured images for they say The Lord does not see us the Lord has gone away from the land
Eze  Then he said to me You will see even more disgusting things which they do
Eze  Then he took me to the door of the way into the Lords house looking to the north and there women were seated weeping for Tammuz
Eze  Then he said to me Have you seen this O son of man you will see even more disgusting things than these
Eze  And he took me into the inner square of the Lords house and at the door of the Temple of the Lord between the covered way and the altar there were about twentyfive men with their backs turned to the Temple of the Lord and their faces turned to the east and they were worshipping the sun turning to the east
Eze  Then he said to me Have you seen this O son of man is it a small thing to the children of Judah that they do the disgusting things which they are doing here for they have made the land full of violent behaviour making me angry again and again and see they put the branch to my nose
Eze  For this reason I will let loose my wrath my eye will not have mercy and I will have no pity
Eze  Then crying out in my hearing in a loud voice he said Let the overseers of the town come near every man armed
Eze  And six men came from the way of the higher doorway looking to the north every man with his axe in his hand and one man among them was clothed in linen with a writers inkpot at his side And they went in and took their places by the brass altar
Eze  And the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the winged ones on which it was resting to the doorstep of the house And crying out to the man clothed in linen who had the writers inkpot at his side
Eze  The Lord said to him Go through the town through the middle of Jerusalem and put a mark on the brows of the men who are sorrowing and crying for all the disgusting things which are done in it
Eze  And to these he said in my hearing Go through the town after him using your axes do not let your eyes have mercy and have no pity
Eze  Give up to destruction old men and young men and virgins little children and women but do not come near any man who has the mark on him and make a start at my holy place So they made a start with the old men who were before the house
Eze  And he said to them Make the house unclean make the open places full of dead go forward and send destruction on the town
Eze  Now while they were doing so and I was untouched I went down on my face and crying out I said Ah Lord will you give all the rest of Israel to destruction in letting loose your wrath on Jerusalem
Eze  Then he said to me The sin of the children of Israel and Judah is very very great and the land is full of blood and the town full of evil ways for they say The Lord has gone away from the land and the Lord does not see
Eze  And as for me my eye will not have mercy and I will have no pity but I will send the punishment of their ways on their heads
Eze  Then the man clothed in linen who had the inkpot at his side came back and said I have done what you gave me orders to do
Eze  Then looking I saw that on the arch which was over the head of the winged ones there was seen over them what seemed like a sapphire stone having the form of a kings seat
Eze  And he said to the man clothed in linen Go in between the wheels under the winged ones and get your two hands full of burning coals from between the winged ones and send them in a shower over the town And he went in before my eyes
Eze  Now the winged ones were stationed on the right side of the house when the man went in and the inner square was full of the cloud
Eze  And the glory of the Lord went up from the winged ones and came to rest over the doorstep of the house and the house was full of the cloud and the open square was full of the shining of the Lords glory
Eze  And the sound of the wings of the winged ones was clear even in the outer square like the voice of the Ruler of all
Eze  And when he gave orders to the man clothed in linen saying Take fire from between the wheels from between the winged ones then he went in and took his place at the side of a wheel
Eze  And stretching out his hand to the fire which was between the winged ones he took some of it and went out
Eze  And I saw the form of a mans hands among the winged ones under their wings
Eze  And looking I saw four wheels by the side of the winged ones one wheel by the side of a winged one and another wheel by the side of another and the wheels were like the colour of a beryl stone to the eye
Eze  In form the four of them were all the same they seemed like a wheel inside a wheel
Eze  When they were moving they went on their four sides without turning they went after the head in the direction in which it was looking they went without turning
Eze  And the edges of the four wheels were full of eyes round about
Eze  As for the wheels they were named in my hearing the circling wheels
Eze  And every one had four faces the first face was the face of a winged one and the second was the face of a man and the third the face of a lion and the fourth the face of an eagle
Eze  And the winged ones went up on high this is the living being which I saw by the river Chebar
Eze  And when the winged ones went the wheels went by their side and when their wings were lifted to take them up from the earth the wheels were not turned from their side
Eze  When they were at rest in their place these were at rest when they were lifted up these went up with them for the spirit of life was in them
Eze  Then the glory of the Lord went out from the doorstep of the house and came to rest over the winged ones
Eze  And the winged ones lifting up their wings went up from the earth before my eyes with the wheels by their side and they came to rest at the east doorway of the Lords house and the glory of the God of Israel was over them on high
Eze  This is the living being which I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar and it was clear to me that they were the winged ones
Eze  Every one had four faces and every one had four wings and hands like a mans hands were under their wings
Eze  As for the form of their faces they were the faces whose form I saw by the river Chebar when they went every one of them went straight forward
Eze  And the wind lifting me up took me to the east doorway of the Lords house looking to the east and at the door I saw twentyfive men and among them I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azzur and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah rulers of the people
Eze  Then he said to me Son of man these are the men who are designing evil who are teaching evil ways in this town
Eze  Who say This is not the time for building houses this town is the cookingpot and we are the flesh
Eze  For this cause be a prophet against them be a prophet O son of man
Eze  And the spirit of the Lord came on me and he said to me Say These are the words of the Lord This is what you have said O children of Israel what comes into your mind is clear to me
Eze  You have made great the number of your dead in this town you have made its streets full of dead men
Eze  For this reason the Lord has said Your dead whom you have put down in its streets they are the flesh and this town is the cookingpot but I will make you come out from inside it
Eze  You have been fearing the sword and I will send the sword on you says the Lord
Eze  I will make you come out from inside the town and will give you up into the hands of men from other lands and will be judge among you
Eze  You will come to your death by the sword and I will be your judge in the land of Israel and you will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  This town will not be your cookingpot and you will not be the flesh inside it I will be your judge at the limit of the land of Israel
Eze  And you will be certain that I am the Lord for you have not been guided by my rules or given effect to my orders but you have been living by the orders of the nations round about you
Eze  Now while I was saying these things death came to Pelatiah the son of Benaiah Then falling down on my face and crying out with a loud voice I said Ah Lord will you put an end to all the rest of Israel
Eze  And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man your countrymen your relations and all the children of Israel all of them are those to whom the people of Jerusalem have said Go far from the Lord this land is given to us for a heritage
Eze  For this reason say This is what the Lord has said Though I have had them moved far off among the nations and though I have sent them wandering among the countries still I have been a safe place for them for a little time in the countries where they have come
Eze  Then say This is what the Lord has said I will get you together from the peoples and make you come out of the countries where you have been sent in flight and I will give you the land of Israel
Eze  And they will come there and take away all the hated and disgusting things from it
Eze  And I will give them a new heart and I will put a new spirit in them and I will take the heart of stone out of their flesh and give them a heart of flesh
Eze  So that they may be guided by my rules and keep my orders and do them and they will be to me a people and I will be to them a God
Eze  But as for those whose heart goes after their hated and disgusting things I will send on their heads the punishment of their ways says the Lord
Eze  Then the wings of the winged ones were lifted up and the wheels were by their side and the glory of the God of Israel was over them on high
Eze  And the glory of the Lord went up from inside the town and came to rest on the mountain on the east side of the town
Eze  And the wind lifting me up took me in the visions of God into Chaldaea to those who had been taken away as prisoners So the vision which I had seen went away from me
Eze  Then I gave an account to those who had been taken prisoners of all the things which the Lord had made me see
Eze  And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man you are living among an uncontrolled people who have eyes to see but see not and ears for hearing but they do not give ear for they are an uncontrolled people
Eze  And you O son of man by day before their eyes get ready the vessels of one who is taken away and go away from your place to another place before their eyes it may be that they will see though they are an uncontrolled people
Eze  By day before their eyes take out your vessels like those of one who is taken away and go out in the evening before their eyes like those who are taken away as prisoners
Eze  Make a hole in the wall before their eyes and go out through it
Eze  And before their eyes take your goods on your back and go out in the dark go with your face covered for I have made you a sign to the children of Israel
Eze  And I did as I was ordered I took out my vessels by day like those of one who is taken away and in the evening I made a hole through the wall with a tentpin and in the dark I went out taking my things on my back before their eyes
Eze  And in the morning the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man has not Israel the uncontrolled people said to you What are you doing
Eze  You are to say to them This is what the Lord has said This word has to do with the ruler in Jerusalem and all the children of Israel in it
Eze  Say I am your sign as I have done so will it be done to them they will go away as prisoners
Eze  And the ruler who is among them will take his goods on his back in the dark and go out he will make a hole in the wall through which to go out he will have his face covered so that he may not be seen
Eze  And my net will be stretched out on him and he will be taken in my cords and I will take him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldaeans but he will not see it and there death will come to him
Eze  And all his helpers round about him and all his armies I will send in flight to every wind and I will let loose a sword after them
Eze  And they will be certain that I am the Lord when I send them in flight among the nations driving them out through the countries
Eze  But a small number of them I will keep from the sword from the need of food and from disease so that they may make clear all their disgusting ways among the nations where they come and they will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  Then the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man take your food with shaking fear and your water with trouble and care
Eze  And say to the people of the land This is what the Lord has said about the people of Jerusalem and the land of Israel They will take their food with care and their drink with wonder so that all the wealth of their land may be taken from it because of the violent ways of the people living in it
Eze  And the peopled towns will be made waste and the land will become a wonder and you will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man what is this saying which you have about the land of Israel The time is long and every vision comes to nothing
Eze  For this cause say to them This is what the Lord has said I have made this saying come to an end and it will no longer be used as a common saying in Israel but say to them The days are near and the effect of every vision
Eze  For there will be no more false visions or smooth use of secret arts in Israel
Eze  For I am the Lord I will say the word and what I say I will do it will not be put off for in your days O uncontrolled people I will say the word and do it says the Lord
Eze  Again the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man see the children of Israel say The vision which he sees is for the days which are a long way off and his words are of times still far away
Eze  Say to them then This is what the Lord has said Not one of my words will be put off any longer but what I say I will do says the Lord
Eze  And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man be a prophet against the prophets of Israel and say to those prophets whose words are the invention of their hearts Give ear to the word of the Lord
Eze  This is what the Lord has said A curse on the foolish prophets who go after the spirit which is in them and have seen nothing
Eze  O Israel your prophets have been like jackals in the waste places
Eze  You have not gone up into the broken places or made up the wall for the children of Israel to take your place in the fight in the day of the Lord
Eze  They have seen visions without substance and made use of secret arts who say The Lord has said and the Lord has not sent them hoping that the word would have effect
Eze  Have you not seen a vision without substance and have you not falsely made use of secret arts when you say The Lord has said though I have said nothing
Eze  So this is what the Lord has said Because your words are without substance and your visions are false see I am against you says the Lord
Eze  And my hand will be against the prophets who see visions without substance and who make false use of secret arts they will not be in the secret of my people and they will not be recorded in the list of the children of Israel and they will not come into the land of Israel and it will be clear to you that I am the Lord
Eze  Because even because they have been guiding my people into error saying Peace when there is no peace and in the building of a division wall they put whitewash on it
Eze  Say to those who put whitewash on it There will be an overflowing shower and you O icedrops will come raining down and it will be broken in two by the stormwind
Eze  And when the wall has come down will they not say to you Where is the whitewash which you put on it
Eze  For this reason the Lord has said I will have it broken in two by a stormwind in my passion and there will be an overflowing shower in my wrath and you O icedrops will come raining angrily down
Eze  So I will let the wall which you were covering with whitewash be broken down I will have it levelled to the earth so that its base is uncovered it will come down and destruction will come on you with it and it will be clear to you that I am the Lord
Eze  So I will let loose my passion on the wall in full measure and on those who put whitewash on it and I will say to you Where is the wall and where are those who put whitewash on it
Eze  Even the prophets of Israel who say words to Jerusalem who see visions of peace for her when there is no peace says the Lord
Eze  And you son of man let your face be turned against the daughters of your people who are acting the part of prophets at their pleasure be a prophet against them and say
Eze  This is what the Lord has said A curse is on the women who are stitching bands on all arms and putting veils on the heads of those of every size so that they may go after souls Will you go after the souls of my people and keep yourselves safe from death
Eze  And you have put me to shame among my people for a little barley and some bits of bread sending death on souls for whom there is no cause of death and keeping those souls living who have no right to life by the false words you say to my people who give ear to what is false
Eze  For this cause the Lord has said See I am against your bands with which you go after souls and I will violently take them off their arms and I will let loose the souls even the souls whom you go after freely
Eze  And I will have your veils violently parted in two and will make my people free from your hands and they will no longer be in your power for you to go after them and you will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  Because with your false words you have given pain to the heart of the upright man when I had not made him sad in order to make strong the hands of the evildoer so that he may not be turned from his evil way and get life
Eze  For this cause you will see no more foolish visions or make false use of secret arts and I will make my people free from your power and you will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  Then certain of the responsible men of Israel came to me and took their seats before me
Eze  And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man these men have taken their false gods into their hearts and put before their faces the sin which is the cause of their fall am I to give ear when they come to me for directions
Eze  For this cause say to them These are the words of the Lord Every man of Israel who has taken his false god into his heart and put before his face the sin which is the cause of his fall and comes to the prophet I the Lord will give him an answer by myself in agreement with the number of his false gods
Eze  So as to take the children of Israel in the thoughts of their hearts because they have become strange to me through their false gods
Eze  For this cause say to the children of Israel These are the words of the Lord Come back and give up your false gods and let your faces be turned from your disgusting things
Eze  When any one of the men of Israel or of those from other lands who are living in Israel who has become strange to me and takes his false gods into his heart and puts before his face the sin which is the cause of his fall comes to the prophet to get directions from me I the Lord will give him an answer by myself
Eze  And my face will be turned against that man and I will make him a sign and a common saying cutting him off from among my people and you will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  And if the prophet tricked by deceit says anything it is I the Lord by whom he has been tricked and I will put out my hand against him and he will be cut off from among my people Israel
Eze  And the punishment of their sin will be on them the sin of the prophet will be the same as the sin of him who goes to him for directions
Eze  So that the children of Israel may no longer go wandering away from me or make themselves unclean with all their wrongdoing but they will be my people and I will be their God says the Lord
Eze  And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man when a land sinning against me does wrong and my hand is stretched out against it and the support of its bread is broken and I make it short of food cutting off man and beast from it
Eze  Even if these three men Noah Daniel and Job were in it only themselves would they keep safe by their righteousness says the Lord
Eze  Or if I send evil beasts through the land causing destruction and making it waste so that no man may go through because of the beasts
Eze  Even if these three men were in it by my life says the Lord they would not keep safe their sons or daughters but only themselves and the land would be made waste
Eze  Or if I send a sword against that land and say Sword go through the land cutting off from it man and beast
Eze  Even if these three men were in it by my life says the Lord they would not keep safe their sons or daughters but only themselves
Eze  Or if I send disease into that land letting loose my wrath on it in blood cutting off from it man and beast
Eze  Even if Noah Daniel and Job were in it by my life says the Lord they would not keep son or daughter safe only themselves would they keep safe through their righteousness
Eze  For this is what the Lord has said How much more when I send my four bitter punishments on Jerusalem the sword and need of food and evil beasts and disease cutting off from it man and beast
Eze  But truly there will still be a small band who will be safe even sons and daughters and they will come out to you and you will see their ways and their doings and you will be comforted about the evil which I have sent on Jerusalem even about everything I have sent on it
Eze  They will give you comfort when you see their ways and their doings and you will be certain that not for nothing have I done all the things I have done in it says the Lord
Eze  And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man what is the vinetree more than any branching tree which is among the trees of the woods
Eze  Will its wood be used for any work do men make of it a pin for hanging any vessel on
Eze  See it is put into the fire for burning the fire has made a meal of its two ends and the middle part of it is burned is it good for any work
Eze  Truly before it was cut down it was not used for any purpose how much less when the fire has made a meal of it and it is burned will it be made into anything
Eze  For this cause the Lord has said Like the vinetree among the trees of the woods which I have given to the fire for burning so will I give the people of Jerusalem
Eze  And my face will be turned against them and though they have come out of the fire they will be burned up by it and it will be clear to you that I am the Lord when my face is turned against them
Eze  And I will make the land a waste because they have done evil says the Lord
Eze  And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man make clear to Jerusalem her disgusting ways
Eze  And say This is what the Lord has said to Jerusalem Your start and your birth was from the land of the Canaanite an Amorite was your father and your mother was a Hittite
Eze  As for your birth on the day of your birth your cord was not cut and you were not washed in water to make you clean you were not salted or folded in linen bands
Eze  No eye had pity on you to do any of these things to you or to be kind to you but you were put out into the open country because your life was hated at the time of your birth
Eze  And when I went past you and saw you stretched out in your blood I said to you Though you are stretched out in your blood have life
Eze  And be increased in number like the buds of the field and you were increased and became great and you came to the time of love your breasts were formed and your hair was long but you were uncovered and without clothing
Eze  Now when I went past you looking at you I saw that your time was the time of love and I put my skirts over you covering your unclothed body and I gave you my oath and made an agreement with you says the Lord and you became mine
Eze  Then I had you washed with water washing away all your blood and rubbing you with oil
Eze  And I had you clothed with needlework and put leather shoes on your feet folding fair linen about you and covering you with silk
Eze  And I made you fair with ornaments and put jewels on your hands and a chain on your neck
Eze  And I put a ring in your nose and earrings in your ears and a beautiful crown on your head
Eze  So you were made beautiful with gold and silver and your clothing was of the best linen and silk and needlework your food was the best meal and honey and oil and you were very beautiful
Eze  You were so beautiful that the story of you went out into all nations you were completely beautiful because of my glory which I had put on you says the Lord
Eze  But you put your faith in the fact that you were beautiful acting like a loose woman because you were widely talked of and offering your cheap love to everyone who went by whoever it might be
Eze  And you took your robes and made high places for yourself ornamented with every colour acting like a loose woman on them without shame or fear
Eze  And you took the fair jewels my silver and gold which I had given to you and made for yourself male images acting like a loose woman with them
Eze  And you took your robes of needlework for their clothing and put my oil and my perfume before them
Eze  And my bread which I gave you the best meal and oil and honey which I gave you for your food you put it before them for a sweet smell says the Lord
Eze  And you took your sons and your daughters whom I had by you offering even these to them to be their food Was your loose behaviour so small a thing
Eze  That you put my children to death and gave them up to go through the fire to them
Eze  And in all your disgusting and false behaviour you had no memory of your early days when you were uncovered and without clothing stretched out in your blood
Eze  And it came about after all your evildoing says the Lord
Eze  That you made for yourself an arched room in every open place
Eze  You put up your high places at the top of every street and made the grace of your form a disgusting thing opening your feet to everyone who went by increasing your loose ways
Eze  And you went with the Egyptians your neighbours great of flesh increasing your loose ways moving me to wrath
Eze  Now then my hand is stretched out against you cutting down your fixed amount and I have given you up to the desire of your haters the daughters of the Philistines who are shamed by your loose ways
Eze  And you went with the Assyrians because of your desire which was without measure you were acting like a loose woman with them and still you had not enough
Eze  And you went on in your loose ways even as far as the land of Chaldaea and still you had not enough
Eze  How feeble is your heart says the Lord seeing that you do all these things the work of a loose and overruling woman
Eze  For you have made your arched room at the top of every street and your high place in every open place though you were not like a loose woman in getting together your payment
Eze  The untrue wife who takes strange lovers in place of her husband
Eze  They give payment to all loose women but you give rewards to your lovers offering them payment so that they may come to you on every side for your cheap love
Eze  And in your loose behaviour you are different from other women for no one goes after you to make love to you and because you give payment and no payment is given to you in this you are different from them
Eze  For this cause O loose woman give ear to the voice of the Lord
Eze  This is what the Lord has said Because your unclean behaviour was let loose and your body uncovered in your loose ways with your lovers and with your disgusting images and for the blood of your children which you gave to them
Eze  For this cause I will get together all your lovers with whom you have taken your pleasure and all those to whom you have given your love with all those who were hated by you I will even make them come together against you on every side and I will have you uncovered before them so that they may see your shame
Eze  And you will be judged by me as women are judged who have been untrue to their husbands and have taken life and I will let loose against you passion and bitter feeling
Eze  I will give you into their hands and your arched room will be overturned and your high places broken down they will take your clothing off you and take away your fair jewels and when they have done you will be uncovered and shamed
Eze  And they will get together a meeting against you stoning you with stones and wounding you with their swords
Eze  And they will have you burned with fire sending punishments on you before the eyes of great numbers of women and I will put an end to your loose ways and you will no longer give payment
Eze  And the heat of my wrath against you will have an end and my bitter feeling will be turned away from you and I will be quiet and will be angry no longer
Eze  Because you have not kept in mind the days when you were young but have been troubling me with all these things for this reason I will make the punishment of your ways come on your head says the Lord because you have done this evil thing in addition to all your disgusting acts
Eze  See in every common saying about you it will be said As the mother is so is her daughter
Eze  You are the daughter of your mother whose soul is turned in disgust from her husband and her children and you are the sister of your sisters who were turned in disgust from their husbands and their children your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite
Eze  Your older sister is Samaria living at your left hand she and her daughters and your younger sister living at your right hand is Sodom and her daughters
Eze  Still you have not gone in their ways or done the disgusting things which they have done but as if that was only a little thing you have gone deeper in evil than they in all your ways
Eze  By my life says the Lord Sodom your sister never did she or her daughters what you and your daughters have done
Eze  Truly this was the sin of your sister Sodom pride a full measure of food and the comforts of wealth in peace were seen in her and her daughters and she gave no help to the poor or to those in need
Eze  They were full of pride and did what was disgusting to me and so I took them away as you have seen
Eze  And Samaria has not done half your sins but you have made the number of your disgusting acts greater than theirs making your sisters seem more upright than you by all the disgusting things which you have done
Eze  And you yourself will be put to shame in that you have given the decision for your sisters through your sins which are more disgusting than theirs they are more upright than you truly you will be shamed and made low for you have made your sisters seem upright
Eze  And I will let their fate be changed the fate of Sodom and her daughters and the fate of Samaria and her daughters and your fate with theirs
Eze  So that you will be shamed and made low because of all you have done when I have mercy on you
Eze  And your sisters Sodom and her daughters will go back to their first condition and Samaria and her daughters will go back to their first condition and you and your daughters will go back to your first condition
Eze  Was not your sister Sodom an oath in your mouth in the day of your pride
Eze  Before your shame was uncovered Now you have become like her a word of shame to the daughters of Edom and all who are round about you the daughters of the Philistines who put shame on you round about
Eze  The reward of your evil designs and your disgusting ways has come on you says the Lord
Eze  For this is what the Lord has said I will do to you as you have done you who putting the oath on one side have let the agreement be broken
Eze  But still I will keep in mind the agreement made with you in the days when you were young and I will make with you an eternal agreement
Eze  Then at the memory of your ways you will be overcome with shame when I take your sisters the older and the younger and give them to you for daughters but not by your agreement
Eze  And I will make my agreement with you and you will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  So that at the memory of these things you may be at a loss never opening your mouth because of your shame when you have my forgiveness for all you have done says the Lord
Eze  And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man give out a dark saying and make a comparison for the children of Israel
Eze  And say This is what the Lord has said A great eagle with great wings full of long feathers of different colours came to Lebanon and took the top of the cedar
Eze  Biting off the highest of its young branches he took it to the land of Canaan and put it in a town of traders
Eze  And he took some of the seed of the land planting it in fertile earth placing it by great waters he put it in like a willowtree
Eze  And its growth went on and it became a vine low and widely stretching whose branches were turned to him and its roots were under him so it became a vine putting out branches and young leaves
Eze  And there was another eagle with great wings and thick feathers and now this vine pushing out its roots to him sent out its branches in his direction from the bed where it was planted so that he might give it water
Eze  He had it planted in a good field by great waters so that it might put out branches and have fruit and be a strong vine
Eze  Say This is what the Lord has said Will it do well will he not have its roots pulled up and its branches cut off so that all its young leaves may become dry and it may be pulled up by its roots
Eze  And if it is planted will it do well will it not become quite dry at the touch of the east wind drying up in the bed where it was planted
Eze  Then the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Say now to this uncontrolled people Are these things not clear to you Say to them See the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and took its king and its rulers away with him to Babylon
Eze  And he took one of the sons of the king and made an agreement with him and he put him under an oath and took away the great men of the land
Eze  So that the kingdom might be made low with no power of lifting itself up but might keep his agreement to be his servants
Eze  But he went against his authority in sending representatives to Egypt to get from them horses and a great army Will he do well will he be safe who does such things if the agreement is broken will he be safe
Eze  By my life says the Lord truly in the place of the king who made him king whose oath he put on one side and let his agreement with him be broken even in Babylon he will come to his death
Eze  And Pharaoh with his strong army and great forces will be no help to him in the war when they put up earthworks and make strong walls for the cutting off of lives
Eze  For he put his oath on one side in letting the agreement be broken and though he had given his hand to it he did all these things he will not get away safe
Eze  And so the Lord has said By my life truly for my oath which he put on one side and my agreement which has been broken I will send punishment on his head
Eze  My net will be stretched out over him and he will be taken in my cords and I will send him to Babylon and there I will be his judge for the wrong which he has done against me
Eze  All his best fightingmen will be put to the sword and the rest will be sent away to every wind and you will be certain that I the Lord have said it
Eze  This is what the Lord has said Further I will take the highest top of the cedar and put it in the earth cutting off from the highest of his young branches a soft one I will have it planted on a high and great mountain
Eze  It will be planted on the high mountain of Israel it will put out branches and have fruit and be a fair cedar under it all birds of every sort will make their livingplace resting in the shade of its branches
Eze  And it will be clear to all the trees of the field that I the Lord have made low the high tree and made high the low tree drying up the green tree and making the dry tree full of growth I the Lord have said it and have done it
Eze  The word of the Lord came to me again saying
Eze  Why do you make use of this saying about the land of Israel The fathers have been tasting bitter grapes and the childrens teeth are on edge
Eze  By my life says the Lord you will no longer have this saying in Israel
Eze  See all souls are mine as the soul of the father so the soul of the son is mine death will be the fate of the sinners soul
Eze  But if a man is upright living rightly and doing righteousness
Eze  And has not taken flesh with the blood for food or given worship to the images of the children of Israel if he has not had connection with his neighbours wife or come near to a woman at the time when she is unclean
Eze  And has done no wrong to any but has given back to the debtor what is his and has taken no ones goods by force and has given food to him who was in need of it and clothing to him who was without it
Eze  And has not given his money out at interest or taken great profits and turning his hand from evildoing has kept faith between man and man
Eze  And has been guided by my rules and has kept my laws and done them he is upright life will certainly be his says the Lord
Eze  If he has a son who is a thief a taker of life who does any of these things
Eze  Who has taken flesh with the blood as food and has had connection with his neighbours wife
Eze  Has done wrong to the poor and to him who is in need and taken property by force and has not given back to one in his debt what is his and has given worship to images and has done disgusting things
Eze  And has given out his money at interest and taken great profits he will certainly not go on living he has done all these disgusting things death will certainly be his fate his blood will be on him
Eze  Now if he has a son who sees all his fathers sins which he has done and in fear does not do the same
Eze  Who has not taken the flesh with the blood for food or given worship to the images of the children of Israel and has not had connection with his neighbours wife
Eze  Or done wrong to any or taken anything from one in his debt or taken goods by force but has given food to him who was in need of it and clothing to him who was without it
Eze  Who has kept his hand from evildoing and has not taken interest or great profits who has done my orders and been guided by my rules he will certainly not be put to death for the evildoing of his father life will certainly be his
Eze  As for his father because he was cruel took goods by force and did what is not good among his people truly death will overtake him in his evildoing
Eze  But you say Why does not the son undergo punishment for the evildoing of the father When the son has done what is ordered and right and has kept my rules and done them life will certainly be his
Eze  The soul which does sin will be put to death the son will not be made responsible for the evildoing of the father or the father for the evildoing of the son the righteousness of the upright will be on himself and the evildoing of the evildoer on himself
Eze  But if the evildoer turning away from all the sins which he has done keeps my rules and does what is ordered and right life will certainly be his death will not be his fate
Eze  Not one of the sins which he has done will be kept in memory against him in the righteousness which he has done he will have life
Eze  Have I any pleasure in the death of the evildoer says the Lord am I not pleased if he is turned from his way so that he may have life
Eze  But when the upright man turning away from his righteousness does evil like all the disgusting things which the evil man does will he have life Not one of his upright acts will be kept in memory in the wrong which he has done and in his sin death will overtake him
Eze  But you say The way of the Lord is not equal Give ear now O children of Israel is my way not equal are not your ways unequal
Eze  When the upright man turning away from his righteousness does evil death will overtake him in the evil which he has done death will overtake him
Eze  Again when the evildoer turning away from the evil he has done does what is ordered and right he will have life for his soul
Eze  Because he had fear and was turned away from all the wrong which he had done life will certainly be his death will not be his fate
Eze  But still the children of Israel say The way of the Lord is not equal O children of Israel are my ways not equal are not your ways unequal
Eze  For this cause I will be your judge O children of Israel judging every man by his ways says the Lord Come back and be turned from all your sins so that they may not be the cause of your falling into evil
Eze  Put away all your evildoing in which you have done sin and make for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit why are you desiring death O children of Israel
Eze  For I have no pleasure in the death of him on whom death comes says the Lord be turned back then and have life
Eze  Take up now a song of grief for the ruler of Israel and say
Eze  What was your mother Like a shelion among lions stretched out among the young lions she gave food to her little ones
Eze  And one of her little ones came to growth under her care and became a young lion learning to go after beasts for his food and he took men for his meat
Eze  And the nations had news of him he was taken in the hole they had made and pulling him with hooks they took him into the land of Egypt
Eze  Now when she saw that her hope was made foolish and gone she took another of her little ones and made him into a young lion
Eze  And he went up and down among the lions and became a young lion learning to go after beasts for his food and he took men for his meat
Eze  And he sent destruction on their widows and made waste their towns and the land and everything in it became waste because of the loud sound of his voice
Eze  Then the nations came against him from the kingdoms round about their net was stretched over him and he was taken in the hole they had made
Eze  They made him a prisoner with hooks and took him to the king of Babylon they put him in the strong place so that his voice might be sounding no longer on the mountains of Israel
Eze  Your mother was in comparison like a vine planted by the waters she was fertile and full of branches because of the great waters
Eze  And she had a strong rod for a rod of authority for the rulers and it became tall among the clouds and it was seen lifted up among the number of its branches
Eze  But she was uprooted in burning wrath and made low on the earth the east wind came drying her up and her branches were broken off her strong rod became dry the fire made a meal of it
Eze  And now she is planted in the waste land in a dry and unwatered country
Eze  And fire has gone out from her rod causing the destruction of her branches so that there is no strong rod in her to be the rulers rod of authority This is a song of grief and it was for a song of grief
Eze  Now it came about in the seventh year in the fifth month on the tenth day of the month that certain of the responsible men of Israel came to get directions from the Lord and were seated before me
Eze  Then the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man say to the responsible men of Israel This is what the Lord has said Have you come to get directions from me By my life says the Lord you will get no directions from me
Eze  Will you be their judge O son of man will you be their judge make clear to them the disgusting ways of their fathers
Eze  And say to them This is what the Lord has said In the day when I took Israel for myself when I made an oath to the seed of the family of Jacob and I gave them knowledge of myself in the land of Egypt saying to them with an oath I am the Lord your God
Eze  In that day I gave my oath to take them out of the land of Egypt into a land which I had been searching out for them a land flowing with milk and honey the glory of all lands
Eze  And I said to them Let every man among you put away the disgusting things to which his eyes are turned and do not make yourselves unclean with the images of Egypt I am the Lord your God
Eze  But they would not be controlled by me and did not give ear to me they did not put away the disgusting things to which their eyes were turned or give up the images of Egypt then I said I would let loose my passion on them to give full effect to my wrath against them in the land of Egypt
Eze  And I was acting for the honour of my name so that it might not be made unclean before the eyes of the nations among whom they were and before whose eyes I gave them knowledge of myself by taking them out of the land of Egypt
Eze  So I made them go out of the land of Egypt and took them into the waste land
Eze  And I gave them my rules and made clear to them my orders which if a man keeps them will be life to him
Eze  And further I gave them my Sabbaths to be a sign between me and them so that it might be clear that I who make them holy am the Lord
Eze  But the children of Israel would not be controlled by me in the waste land they were not guided by my rules and they were turned away from my orders which if a man does them will be life to him and they had no respect for my Sabbaths then I said that I would let loose my passion on them in the waste land and put an end to them
Eze  And I was acting for the honour of my name so that it might not be made unclean in the eyes of the nations before whose eyes I had taken them out
Eze  And further I gave my oath to them in the waste land that I would not take them into the land which I had given them a land flowing with milk and honey the glory of all lands
Eze  Because they were turned away from my orders and were not guided by my rules and had no respect for my Sabbaths for their hearts went after their images
Eze  But still my eye had pity on them and I kept them from destruction and did not put an end to them completely in the waste land
Eze  And I said to their children in the waste land Do not be guided by the rules of your fathers or keep their orders or make yourselves unclean with their images
Eze  I am the Lord your God be guided by my rules and keep my orders and do them
Eze  And keep my Sabbaths holy and they will be a sign between me and you so that it may be clear to you that I am the Lord your God
Eze  But the children would not be controlled by me they were not guided by my rules and they did not keep and do my orders which if a man does them will be life to him and they had no respect for my Sabbaths then I said I would let loose my passion on them to give full effect to my wrath against them in the waste land
Eze  And I was acting for the honour of my name so that it might not be made unclean in the eyes of the nations before whose eyes I had taken them out
Eze  Further I gave my oath to them in the waste land that I would send them wandering among the nations driving them out among the countries
Eze  Because they had not done my orders but had been turned away from my rules and had not given respect to my Sabbaths and their eyes were turned to the images of their fathers
Eze  And further I gave them rules which were not good and orders in which there was no life for them
Eze  I made them unclean in the offerings they gave causing them to make every first child go through the fire so that I might put an end to them
Eze  For this cause son of man say to the children of Israel This is what the Lord has said In this your fathers have further put shame on my name by doing wrong against me
Eze  For when I had taken them into the land which I made an oath to give to them then they saw every high hill and every branching tree and made their offerings there moving me to wrath by their offerings and there the sweet smell of their offerings went up and their drink offerings were drained out
Eze  Then I said to them What is this high place where you go to no purpose And it is named Bamah to this day
Eze  For this cause say to the children of Israel This is what the Lord has said Are you making yourselves unclean as your fathers did are you being untrue to me by going after their disgusting works
Eze  And when you give your offerings causing your sons to go through the fire you make yourselves unclean with all your images to this day and will you come to me for directions O children of Israel By my life says the Lord you will get no direction from me
Eze  And that which comes into your minds will never take place when you say We will be like the nations like the families of the countries servants of wood and stone
Eze  By my life says the Lord truly with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm and with burning wrath let loose I will be King over you
Eze  And I will take you out from the peoples and get you together out of the countries where you are wandering with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm and with burning wrath let loose
Eze  And I will take you into the waste land of the peoples and there I will take up the cause with you face to face
Eze  As I took up the cause with your fathers in the waste land of the land of Egypt so will I take up the cause with you says the Lord
Eze  And I will make you go under the rod and will make you small in number
Eze  Clearing out from among you all those who are uncontrolled and who are sinning against me I will take them out of the land where they are living but they will not come into the land of Israel and you will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  As for you O children of Israel the Lord has said Let every man completely put away his images and give ear to me and let my holy name no longer be shamed by your offerings and your images
Eze  For in my holy mountain in the high mountain of Israel says the Lord there all the children of Israel all of them will be my servants in the land there I will take pleasure in them and there I will be worshipped with your offerings and the firstfruits of the things you give and with all your holy things
Eze  I will take pleasure in you as in a sweet smell when I take you out from the peoples and get you together from the countries where you have been sent in flight and I will make myself holy in you before the eyes of the nations
Eze  And you will be certain that I am the Lord when I take you into the land of Israel into the country which I made an oath to give to your fathers
Eze  And there at the memory of your ways and of all the things you did to make yourselves unclean you will have bitter hate for yourselves because of all the evil things you have done
Eze  And you will be certain that I am the Lord when I take you in hand for the honour of my name and not for your evil ways or your unclean doings O children of Israel says the Lord
Eze  Then the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man let your face be turned to the south let your words be dropped to the south and be a prophet against the woodland of the South
Eze  And say to the woodland of the South Give ear to the words of the Lord this is what the Lord has said See I will have a fire lighted in you for the destruction of every green tree in you and every dry tree the flaming flame will not be put out and all faces from the south to the north will be burned by it
Eze  And all flesh will see that I the Lord have had it lighted it will not be put out
Eze  Then I said Ah Lord they say of me Is he not a maker of stories
Eze  And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man let your face be turned to Jerusalem let your words be dropped in the direction of her holy place and be a prophet against the land of Israel
Eze  And say to the land of Israel These are the words of the Lord See I am against you and I will take my sword out of its cover cutting off from you the upright and the evil
Eze  Because I am going to have the upright and the evil cut off from you for this cause my sword will go out from its cover against all flesh from the south to the north
Eze  And all flesh will see that I the Lord have taken my sword out of its cover and it will never go back
Eze  Make sounds of grief son of man with body bent and a bitter heart make sounds of grief before their eyes
Eze  And when they say to you Why are you making sounds of grief then say Because of the news for it is coming and every heart will become soft and all hands will be feeble and every spirit will be burning low and all knees will be turned to water see it is coming and it will be done says the Lord
Eze  And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man say as a prophet These are the words of the Lord Say A sword a sword which has been made sharp and polished
Eze  It has been made sharp to give death it is polished so that it may be like a thunderflame 
Eze  And I have given it to the polisher so that it may be taken in the hand he has made the sword sharp he has had it polished to put it into the hand of him who gives death
Eze  Give loud cries and make sounds of grief O son of man for it has come on my people it has come on all the rulers of Israel fear of the sword has come on my people for this cause give signs of grief
Eze  
Eze  So then son of man be a prophet and put your hands together with a loud sound and give two blows with the sword and even three it is the sword of those who are wounded even the sword of the wounded the great sword which goes round about them
Eze  In order that hearts may become soft and the number of those who are falling may be increased I have sent death by the sword against all their doors you are made like a flame you are polished for death
Eze  Be pointed to the right to the left wherever your edge is ordered
Eze  And I will put my hands together with a loud sound and I will let my wrath have rest I the Lord have said it
Eze  And the word of the Lord came to me again saying
Eze  And you son of man have two ways marked out so that the sword of the king of Babylon may come let the two of them come out of one land and let there be a pillar at the top of the road
Eze  Put a pillar at the top of the road for the sword to come to Rabbah in the land of the children of Ammon and to Judah and to Jerusalem in the middle of her
Eze  For the king of Babylon took his place at the parting of the ways at the top of the two roads to make use of secret arts shaking the arrows this way and that he put questions to the images of his gods he took note of the inner parts of dead beasts
Eze  At his right hand was the fate of Jerusalem to give orders for destruction to send up the warcry to put engines of war against the doors lifting up earthworks building walls
Eze  And this answer given by secret arts will seem false to those who have given their oaths and have let them be broken but he will keep the memory of evildoing so that they may be taken
Eze  For this cause the Lord has said Because you have made your evildoing come to mind by the uncovering of your wrongdoing causing your sins to be seen in all your evildoings because you have come to mind you will be taken in them
Eze  And you O evil one wounded to death O ruler of Israel whose day has come in the time of the last punishment
Eze  This is what the Lord has said Take away the holy headdress take off the crown this will not be again let that which is low be lifted up and that which is high be made low
Eze  I will let it be overturned overturned overturned this will not be again till he comes whose right it is and I will give it to him
Eze  And you son of man say as a prophet This is what the Lord has said about the children of Ammon and about their shame Say A sword even a sword let loose polished for death to make it shining so that it may be like a flame
Eze  Your vision is to no purpose your use of secret arts gives a false answer to put it on the necks of evildoers who are wounded to death whose day has come in the time of the last punishment
Eze  Go back into your cover In the place where you were made in the land from which you were taken I will be your judge
Eze  And I will let loose my burning passion on you breathing out on you the fire of my wrath and I will give you up into the hands of men like beasts trained to destruction
Eze  You will be food for the fire your blood will be drained out in the land there will be no more memory of you for I the Lord have said it
Eze  And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  And you son of man will you be a judge will you be a judge of the town of blood then make clear to her all her disgusting ways
Eze  And you are to say This is what the Lord has said A town causing blood to be drained out in her streets so that her time may come and making images in her to make her unclean
Eze  You are responsible for the blood drained out by you and you are unclean through the images which you have made and you have made your day come near and the time of your judging has come for this cause I have made you a name of shame to the nations and a cause of laughing to all countries
Eze  Those who are near and those who are far from you will make sport of you your name is unclean you are full of sounds of fear
Eze  See the rulers of Israel every one in his family have been causing death in you
Eze  In you they have had no respect for father and mother in you they have been cruel to the man from a strange land in you they have done wrong to the child without a father and to the widow
Eze  You have made little of my holy things and have made my Sabbaths unclean
Eze  In you there are men who say evil of others causing death in you they have taken the flesh with the blood for food in your streets they have put evil designs into effect
Eze  In you they have let the shame of their fathers be seen in you they have done wrong to a woman at the time when she was unclean
Eze  And in you one man has done what was disgusting with his neighbours wife and another has made his daughterinlaw unclean and another has done wrong to his sister his fathers daughter
Eze  In you they have taken rewards as the price of blood you have taken interest and great profits and you have taken away your neighbours goods by force and have not kept me in mind says the Lord
Eze  See then I have made my hands come together in wrath against your taking of goods by force and against the blood which has been flowing in you
Eze  Will your heart be high or your hands strong in the days when I take you in hand I the Lord have said it and will do it
Eze  And I will send you in flight among the nations and wandering among the countries and I will completely take away out of you everything which is unclean
Eze  And you will be made low before the eyes of the nations and it will be clear to you that I am the Lord
Eze  And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man the children of Israel have become like the poorest sort of waste metal to me they are all silver and brass and tin and iron and lead mixed with waste
Eze  For this cause the Lord has said Because you have all become waste metal see I will get you together inside Jerusalem
Eze  As they put silver and brass and iron and lead and tin together inside the oven heating up the fire on it to make it soft so will I get you together in my wrath and in my passion and heating the fire with my breath will make you soft
Eze  Yes I will take you breathing on you the fire of my wrath and you will become soft in it
Eze  As silver becomes soft in the oven so you will become soft in it and you will be certain that I the Lord have let loose my passion on you
Eze  And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man say to her You are a land on which no rain or thunderstorm has come in the day of wrath
Eze  Her rulers in her are like a loudvoiced lion violently taking his food they have made a meal of souls they have taken wealth and valued property they have made great the number of widows in her
Eze  Her priests have been acting violently against my law they have made my holy things unclean they have made no division between what is holy and what is common and they have not made it clear that the unclean is different from the clean and their eyes have been shut to my Sabbaths and I am not honoured among them
Eze  Her rulers in her are like wolves violently taking their food putting men to death and causing the destruction of souls so that they may get their profit
Eze  And her prophets have been using whitewash seeing foolish visions and making false use of secret arts saying This is what the Lord has said when the Lord has said nothing
Eze  The people of the land have been acting cruelly taking mens goods by force they have been hard on the poor and those in need and have done wrong to the man from a strange land
Eze  And I was looking for a man among them who would make up the wall and take his station in the broken place before me for the land so that I might not send destruction on it but there was no one
Eze  And I let loose my passion on them and have put an end to them in the fire of my wrath I have made the punishment of their ways come on their heads says the Lord
Eze  The word of the Lord came to me again saying
Eze  Son of man there were two women daughters of one mother
Eze  They were acting like loose women in Egypt when they were young their behaviour was loose there their breasts were crushed even the points of their young breasts were crushed
Eze  Their names were Oholah the older and Oholibah her sister and they became mine and gave birth to sons and daughters As for their names Samaria is Oholah and Jerusalem Oholibah
Eze  And Oholah was untrue to me when she was mine she was full of desire for her lovers even for the Assyrians her neighbours
Eze  Who were clothed in blue captains and rulers all of them young men to be desired horsemen seated on horses
Eze  And she gave her unclean love to them all of them the noblest men of Assyria and she made herself unclean with the images of all who were desired by her
Eze  And she has not given up her loose ways from the time when she was in Egypt for when she was young they were her lovers and by them her young breasts were crushed and they let loose on her their unclean desire
Eze  For this cause I gave her up into the hands of her lovers into the hands of the Assyrians on whom her desire was fixed
Eze  By these her shame was uncovered they took her sons and daughters and put her to death with the sword and she became a cause of wonder to women for they gave her the punishment which was right
Eze  And her sister Oholibah saw this but her desire was even more unmeasured and her loose behaviour was worse than that of her sister
Eze  She was full of desire for the Assyrians captains and rulers her neighbours clothed in blue horsemen going on horses all of them young men to be desired
Eze  And I saw that she had become unclean the two of them went the same way
Eze  And her loose behaviour became worse for she saw men pictured on a wall pictures of the Chaldaeans painted in bright red
Eze  With bands round their bodies and with headdresses hanging round their heads all of them looking like rulers like the Babylonians the land of whose birth is Chaldaea
Eze  And when she saw them she was full of desire for them and sent servants to them in Chaldaea
Eze  And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love and made her unclean with their loose desire and she became unclean with them and her soul was turned from them
Eze  So her loose behaviour was clearly seen and her shame uncovered then my soul was turned from her as it had been turned from her sister
Eze  But still she went on the more with her loose behaviour keeping in mind the early days when she had been a loose woman in the land of Egypt
Eze  And she was full of desire for her lovers whose flesh is like the flesh of asses and whose seed is like the seed of horses
Eze  And she made the memory of the loose ways of her early years come back to mind when her young breasts were crushed by the Egyptians
Eze  For this cause O Oholibah this is what the Lord has said See I will make your lovers come up against you even those from whom your soul is turned away in disgust and I will make them come up against you on every side
Eze  The Babylonians and all the Chaldaeans Pekod and Shoa and Koa and all the Assyrians with them young men to be desired captains and rulers all of them and chiefs her neighbours all of them on horseback
Eze  And they will come against you from the north on horseback with warcarriages and a great band of peoples they will put themselves in order against you with breastplate and bodycover and metal headdress round about you and I will make them your judges and they will give their decision against you as seems right to them
Eze  And my bitter feeling will be working against you and they will take you in hand with passion they will take away your nose and your ears and the rest of you will be put to the sword they will take your sons and daughters and the rest of you will be burned up in the fire
Eze  And they will take all your clothing off you and take away your ornaments
Eze  So I will put an end to your evil ways and your loose behaviour which came from the land of Egypt and your eyes will never be lifted up to them again and you will have no more memory of Egypt
Eze  For this is what the Lord has said See I will give you up into the hands of those who are hated by you into the hands of those from whom your soul is turned away in disgust
Eze  And they will take you in hand with hate and take away all the fruit of your work and let you be unveiled and without clothing and the shame of your loose behaviour will be uncovered your evil designs and your loose ways
Eze  They will do these things to you because you have been untrue to me and have gone after the nations and have become unclean with their images
Eze  You have gone in the way of your sister and I will give her cup into your hand
Eze  This is what the Lord has said You will take a drink from your sisters cup which is deep and wide you will be laughed at and looked down on more than you are able to undergo
Eze  You will be broken and full of sorrow with the cup of wonder and destruction with the cup of your sister Samaria
Eze  And after drinking it and draining it out you will take the last drops of it to the end pulling off your breasts for I have said it says the Lord
Eze  So this is what the Lord has said Because you have not kept me in your memory and because your back has been turned to me you will even undergo the punishment of your evil designs and your loose ways
Eze  Then the Lord said to me Son of man will you be the judge of Oholibah then make clear to her the disgusting things she has done
Eze  For she has been false to me and blood is on her hands and with her images she has been untrue and more than this she made her sons whom she had by me go through the fire to them to be burned up
Eze  Further this is what she has done to me she has made my holy place unclean and has made my Sabbaths unclean
Eze  For when she had made an offering of her children to her images she came into my holy place to make it unclean see this is what she has done inside my house
Eze  And she even sent for men to come from far away to whom a servant was sent and they came for whom she was washing her body and painting her eyes and making herself fair with ornaments
Eze  And she took her seat on a great bed with a table put ready before it on which she put my perfume and my oil
Eze   and they put jewels on her hands and beautiful crowns on her head
Eze  Then I said  now she will go on with her loose ways
Eze  And they went in to her as men go to a loose woman so they went in to Oholibah the loose woman
Eze  And upright men will be her judges judging her as false wives and women who take lives are judged because she has been untrue to me and blood is on her hands
Eze  For this is what the Lord has said I will make a great meeting of the people come together against her and will send on her shaking fear and take everything from her
Eze  And the meeting after stoning her with stones will put an end to her with their swords they will put her sons and daughters to death and have her house burned up with fire
Eze  And I will put an end to evil in all the land teaching all women not to do as you have done
Eze  And I will send on you the punishment of your evil ways and you will be rewarded for your sins with your images and you will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  And the word of the Lord came to me in the ninth year in the tenth month on the tenth day of the month saying
Eze  Son of man put down in writing this very day The king of Babylon let loose the weight of his attack against Jerusalem on this very day
Eze  And make a comparison for this uncontrolled people and say to them This is what the Lord has said Put on the cookingpot put it on the fire and put water in it
Eze  And get the bits together the fat tail every good part the leg and the top part of it make it full of the best bones
Eze  Take the best of the flock put much wood under it see that its bits are boiling well let the bones be cooked inside it
Eze  For this is what the Lord has said A curse is on the town of blood the cookingpot which is unclean inside which has never been made clean take out its bits its fate is still to come on it
Eze  For her blood is in her she has put it on the open rock not draining it on to the earth so that it might be covered with dust
Eze  In order that it might make wrath come up to give punishment she has put her blood on the open rock so that it may not be covered
Eze  For this cause the Lord has said A curse is on the town of blood and I will make great the burning mass
Eze  Put on much wood heating up the fire boiling the flesh well and making the soup thick and let the bones be burned
Eze  And I will put her on the coals so that she may be heated and her brass burned so that what is unclean in her may become soft and her waste be completely taken away
Eze  I have made myself tired to no purpose still all the waste which is in her has not come out it has an evil smell
Eze  As for your unclean purpose because I have been attempting to make you clean but you have not been made clean from it you will not be made clean till I have let loose my passion on you in full measure
Eze  I the Lord have said the word and I will do it I will not go back or have mercy and my purpose will not be changed in the measure of your ways and of your evil doings you will be judged says the Lord
Eze  And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man see I am taking away the desire of your eyes by disease but let there be no sorrow or weeping or drops running from your eyes
Eze  Let there be no sound of sorrow make no weeping for your dead put on your headdress and your shoes on your feet let not your lips be covered and do not take the food of those in grief
Eze  So in the morning I was teaching the people and in the evening death took my wife and in the morning I did what I had been ordered to do
Eze  And the people said to me Will you not make clear to us the sense of these things is it for us you do them
Eze  Then I said to them The word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Say to the people of Israel The Lord has said See I will make my holy place unclean the pride of your strength the pleasure of your eyes and the desire of your soul and your sons and daughters who did not come with you here will be put to the sword
Eze  And you will do as I have done not covering your lips or taking the food of those in grief
Eze  And your headdresses will be on your heads and your shoes on your feet there will be no sorrow or weeping but you will be wasting away in the punishment of your evildoing and you will be looking at one another in wonder
Eze  And Ezekiel will be a sign to you everything he has done you will do when this takes place you will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  And as for you son of man your mouth will be shut in the day when I take from them their strength the joy of their glory the desire of their eyes and that on which their hearts are fixed and their sons and daughters
Eze  In that day one who has got away safe will come to you to give you news of it
Eze  In that day your mouth will be open to him who has got away safe and you will say words to him and your lips will no longer be shut so you will be a sign to them and they will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man let your face be turned to the children of Ammon and be a prophet against them
Eze  And say to the children of Ammon Give ear to the word of the Lord this is what the Lord has said Because you said Aha against my holy place when it was made unclean and against the land of Israel when it was made waste and against the people of Judah when they were taken away as prisoners
Eze  For this cause I will give you up to the children of the east for their heritage and they will put their tentcircles in you and make their houses in you they will take your fruit for their food and your milk for their drink
Eze  And I will make Rabbah a place for housing camels and the children of Ammon a restingplace for flocks and you will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  For the Lord has said Because you have made sounds of joy with your hands stamping your feet and have been glad putting shame with all your soul on the land of Israel
Eze  For this cause my hand has been stretched out against you and I will give up your goods to be taken by the nations I will have you cut off from the peoples and will put an end to you among the countries I will give you up to destruction and you will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  This is what the Lord has said Because Moab and Seir are saying See the people of Judah are like all the nations
Eze  For this cause I will let the side of Moab be uncovered and his towns on every side the glory of the land Bethjeshimoth Baalmeon and as far as Kiriathaim
Eze  To the children of the east I have given her for a heritage as well as the children of Ammon so that there may be no memory of her among the nations
Eze  And I will be the judge of Moab and they will see that I am the Lord
Eze  This is what the Lord has said Because Edom has taken his payment from the people of Judah and has done great wrong in taking payment from them
Eze  The Lord has said My hand will be stretched out against Edom cutting off from it man and beast and I will make it waste from Teman even as far as Dedan they will be put to the sword
Eze  I will take payment from Edom because of my people Israel and I will take Edom in hand in my wrath and in my passion and they will have experience of my reward says the Lord
Eze  This is what the Lord has said Because the Philistines have taken payment with the purpose of causing shame and destruction with unending hate
Eze  The Lord has said See my hand will be stretched out against the Philistines cutting off the Cherethites and sending destruction on the rest of the sealand
Eze  And I will take great payment from them with acts of wrath and they will be certain that I am the Lord when I send my punishment on them
Eze  Now in the eleventh year on the first day of the month the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man because Tyre has said against Jerusalem Aha she who was the doorway of the peoples is broken she is turned over to them she who was full is made waste
Eze  For this cause the Lord has said See I am against you O Tyre and will send up a number of nations against you as the sea sends up its waves
Eze  And they will give the walls of Tyre to destruction and have its towers broken and I will take even her dust away from her and make her an uncovered rock
Eze  She will be a place for the stretching out of nets in the middle of the sea for I have said it says the Lord and her goods will be given over to the nations
Eze  And her daughters in the open country will be put to the sword and they will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  For this is what the Lord has said See I will send up from the north Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon king of kings against Tyre with horses and warcarriages and with an army and great numbers of people
Eze  He will put to the sword your daughters in the open country he will make strong walls against you and put up an earthwork against you arming himself for war against you
Eze  He will put up his engines of war against your walls and your towers will be broken down by his axes
Eze  Because of the number of his horses you will be covered with their dust your walls will be shaking at the noise of the horsemen and of the wheels and of the warcarriages when he comes through your doorways as into a town which has been broken open
Eze  Your streets will be stamped down by the feet of his horses he will put your people to the sword and will send down the pillars of your strength to the earth
Eze  They will take by force all your wealth and go off with the goods with which you do trade they will have your walls broken down and all the houses of your desire given up to destruction they will put your stones and your wood and your dust deep in the water
Eze  I will put an end to the noise of your songs and the sound of your instruments of music will be gone for ever
Eze  I will make you an uncovered rock you will be a place for the stretching out of nets there will be no building you up again for I the Lord have said it says the Lord
Eze  This is what the Lord has said to Tyre Will not the sealands be shaking at the sound of your fall when the wounded give cries of pain when men are put to the sword in you
Eze  Then all the rulers of the sea will come down from their high seats and put away their robes and take off their clothing of needlework they will put on the clothing of grief they will take their seats on the earth shaking with fear every minute and overcome with wonder at you
Eze  And they will send up a song of grief for you and say to you What destruction has come on you how are you cut off from the sea the noted town which was strong in the sea she and her people causing the fear of them to come on all the dry land
Eze  Now the sealands will be shaking in the day of your fall and all the ships on the sea will be overcome with fear at your going
Eze  For this is what the Lord has said I will make you a waste town like the towns which are unpeopled when I make the deep come upon you covering you with great waters
Eze  Then I will make you go down with those who go down into the underworld to the people of the past causing your livingplace to be in the deepest parts of the earth in places long unpeopled with those who go down into the deep so that there will be no one living in you and you will have no glory in the land of the living
Eze  I will make you a thing of fear and you will come to an end even if you are looked for you will not be seen again for ever says the Lord
Eze  The word of the Lord came to me again saying
Eze  And you son of man make a song of grief for Tyre
Eze  And say to Tyre O you who are seated at the doorway of the sea trading for the peoples with the great sealands these are the words of the Lord You O Tyre have said I am a ship completely beautiful
Eze  Your builders have made your outlines in the heart of the seas they have made you completely beautiful
Eze  They have made all your boards of firtrees from Senir they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make the supports for your sails
Eze  Of oaktrees from Bashan they have made your driving blades they have made your floors of ivory and boxwood from the sealands of Kittim
Eze  The best linen with needlework from Egypt was your sail stretched out to be a flag for you blue and purple from the sealands of Elishah gave you shade
Eze  The people of Zidon and Arvad were your boatmen the wise men of Zemer were in you they were guiding your ships
Eze  The responsible men of Gebal and its wise men were in you making your boards watertight all the ships of the sea with their seamen were in you trading in your goods

Eze  Your boatmen have taken you into great waters you have been broken by the east wind in the heart of the seas
Eze  Your wealth and your goods the things in which you do trade your seamen and those guiding your ships those who make your boards watertight and those who do business with your goods and all your men of war who are in you with all who have come together in you will go down into the heart of the seas in the day of your downfall
Eze  At the sound of the cry of your ships guides the boards of the ship will be shaking
Eze  And all the boatmen the seamen and those who are expert at guiding a ship through the sea will come down from their ships and take their places on the land
Eze  And their voices will be sounding over you and crying bitterly they will put dust on their heads rolling themselves in the dust
Eze  And they will have the hair of their heads cut off because of you and will put haircloth on their bodies weeping for you with bitter grief in their souls even with bitter sorrow
Eze  And in their weeping they will make a song of grief for you sorrowing over you and saying Who is like Tyre who has come to an end in the deep sea

Eze  Those who do business among the peoples make sounds of surprise at you you have become a thing of fear you have come to an end for ever
Eze  The word of the Lord came to me again saying
Eze  Son of man say to the ruler of Tyre This is what the Lord has said Because your heart has been lifted up and you have said I am a god I am seated on the seat of God in the heart of the seas but you are man and not God though you have made your heart as the heart of God
Eze  See you are wiser than Daniel there is no secret which is deeper than your knowledge
Eze  By your wisdom and deep knowledge you have got power for yourself and put silver and gold in your storehouses
Eze  By your great wisdom and by your trade your power is increased and your heart is lifted up because of your power
Eze  For this cause the Lord has said Because you have made your heart as the heart of God
Eze  See I am sending against you strange men feared among the nations they will let loose their swords against your bright wisdom they will make your glory a common thing
Eze  They will send you down to the underworld and your death will be the death of those who are put to the sword in the heart of the seas
Eze  Will you say in the face of those who are taking your life I am God but you are man and not God in the hands of those who are wounding you
Eze  Your death will be the death of those who are without circumcision by the hands of men from strange lands for I have said it says the Lord
Eze  Then the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man make a song of grief for the king of Tyre and say to him This is what the Lord has said You are allwise and completely beautiful
Eze  You were in Eden the garden of God every stone of great price was your clothing the sardius the topaz and the diamond the beryl the onyx and the jasper the emerald and the carbuncle your storehouses were full of gold and things of great price were in you in the day when you were made they were got ready
Eze  I gave you your place with the winged one I put you on the mountain of God you went up and down among the stones of fire
Eze  There has been no evil in your ways from the day when you were made till sin was seen in you
Eze  Through all your trading you have become full of violent ways and have done evil so I sent you out shamed from the mountain of God the winged one put an end to you from among the stones of fire
Eze  Your heart was lifted up because you were beautiful you made your wisdom evil through your sin I have sent you down even to the earth I have made you low before kings so that they may see you
Eze  By all your sin even by your evil trading you have made your holy places unclean so I will make a fire come out from you it will make a meal of you and I will make you as dust on the earth before the eyes of all who see you
Eze  All who have knowledge of you among the peoples will be overcome with wonder at you you have become a thing of fear and you will never be seen again
Eze  And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man let your face be turned to Zidon and be a prophet against it and say
Eze  These are the words of the Lord See I am against you O Zidon and I will get glory for myself in you and they will be certain that I am the Lord when I send my punishments on her and I will be seen to be holy in her
Eze  And I will send on her disease and blood in her streets and the wounded will be falling in the middle of her and the sword will be against her on every side and they will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  And there will no longer be a plant with sharp points wounding the children of Israel or a thorn troubling them among any who are round about them who put shame on them and they will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  This is what the Lord has said When I have got together the children of Israel from the peoples among whom they are wandering and have been made holy among them before the eyes of the nations then they will have rest in the land which is theirs which I gave to my servant Jacob
Eze  And they will be safe there building houses and planting vinegardens and living without fear when I have sent my punishments on all those who put shame on them round about them and they will be certain that I am the Lord their God
Eze  In the tenth year in the tenth month on the twelfth day of the month the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man let your face be turned against Pharaoh king of Egypt and be a prophet against him and against all Egypt
Eze  Say to them These are the words of the Lord See I am against you Pharaoh king of Egypt the great riverbeast stretched out among his Nile streams who has said The Nile is mine and I have made it for myself
Eze  And I will put hooks in your mouth and the fish of your streams will be hanging from your skin and I will make you come up out of your streams with all the fish of your streams hanging from your skin
Eze  And I will let you be in the waste land you and all the fish of your streams you will go down on the face of the land you will not be taken up or put to rest in the earth I have given you for food to the beasts of the field and the birds of the heaven
Eze  And it will be clear to all the people of Egypt that I am the Lord because you have been a false support to the children of Israel
Eze  When they took a grip of you in their hands you were crushed so that their arms were broken and when they put their weight on you for support you were broken and all their muscles gave way
Eze  For this cause the Lord has said See I am sending a sword on you cutting off from you man and beast
Eze  And the land of Egypt will be an unpeopled waste and they will be certain that I am the Lord because he has said The Nile is mine and I made it
Eze  See then I am against you and against your streams and I will make the land of Egypt an unpeopled waste from Migdol to Syene even as far as the edge of Ethiopia
Eze  No foot of man will go through it and no foot of beast and it will be unpeopled for forty years
Eze  I will make the land of Egypt a waste among the countries which are made waste and her towns will be unpeopled among the towns which have been made waste for forty years and I will send the Egyptians in flight among the nations and wandering through the countries
Eze  For this is what the Lord has said At the end of forty years I will get the Egyptians together from the peoples where they have gone in flight
Eze  I will let the fate of Egypt be changed and will make them come back into the land of Pathros into the land from which they came and there they will be an unimportant kingdom
Eze  It will be the lowest of the kingdoms and never again will it be lifted up over the nations I will make them small so that they may not have rule over the nations
Eze  And Egypt will no longer be the hope of the children of Israel causing sin to come to mind when their eyes are turned to them and they will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  Now in the twentyseventh year in the first month on the first day of the month the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made his army do hard work against Tyre and the hair came off every head and every arm was rubbed smooth but he and his army got no payment out of Tyre for the hard work which he had done against it
Eze  For this cause the Lord has said See I am giving the land of Egypt to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon he will take away her wealth and take her goods by force and everything which is there and this will be the payment for his army
Eze  I have given him the land of Egypt as the reward for his hard work because they were working for me says the Lord
Eze  In that day I will make a horn put out buds for the children of Israel and I will let your words come freely among them and they will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  The word of the Lord came to me again saying
Eze  Son of man be a prophet and say These are the words of the Lord Give a cry Aha for the day
Eze  For the day is near the day of the Lord is near a day of cloud it will be the time of the nations
Eze  And a sword will come on Egypt and cruel pain will be in Ethiopia when they are falling by the sword in Egypt and they will take away her wealth and her bases will be broken down
Eze  Ethiopia and Put and Lud and all the mixed people and Libya and the children of the land of the Cherethites will all be put to death with them by the sword
Eze  This is what the Lord has said The supporters of Egypt will have a fall and the pride of her power will come down from Migdol to Syene they will be put to the sword in it says the Lord
Eze  And she will be made waste among the countries which have been made waste and her towns will be among the towns which are unpeopled
Eze  And they will be certain that I am the Lord when I have put a fire in Egypt and all her helpers are broken
Eze  In that day men will go out quickly to take the news causing fear in untroubled Ethiopia and bitter pain will come on them as in the day of Egypt for see it is coming
Eze  This is what the Lord has said I will put an end to great numbers of the people of Egypt by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon
Eze  He and the people with him causing fear among the nations will be sent for the destruction of the land their swords will be let loose against Egypt and the land will be full of dead
Eze  And I will make the Nile streams dry and will give the land into the hands of evil men causing the land and everything in it to be wasted by the hands of men from a strange country I the Lord have said it
Eze  This is what the Lord has said In addition to this I will give up the images to destruction and put an end to the false gods in Noph never again will there be a ruler in the land of Egypt and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt
Eze  And I will make Pathros a waste and put a fire in Zoan and send my punishments on No
Eze  I will let loose my wrath on Sin the strong place of Egypt cutting off the mass of the people of No
Eze  And I will put a fire in Egypt Syene will be twisting in pain and No will be broken into as by the onrush of waters
Eze  The young men of On and Pibeseth will be put to the sword and these towns will be taken away prisoners
Eze  And at Tehaphnehes the day will become dark when the yoke of Egypt is broken there and the pride of her power comes to an end as for her she will be covered with a cloud and her daughters will be taken away prisoners
Eze  And I will send my punishments on Egypt and they will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  Now in the eleventh year in the first month on the seventh day of the month the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt has been broken by me and no band has been put round it to make it well no band has been twisted round it to make it strong for gripping the sword
Eze  For this cause the Lord has said See I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt and by me his strong arm will be broken and I will make the sword go out of his hand
Eze  And I will send the Egyptians in flight among the nations and wandering through the countries
Eze  And I will make the arms of the king of Babylon strong and will put my sword in his hand but Pharaohs arms will be broken and he will give cries of pain before him like the cries of a man wounded to death
Eze  And I will make the arms of the king of Babylon strong and the arms of Pharaoh will be hanging down and they will be certain that I am the Lord when I put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon and it is stretched out against the land of Egypt
Eze  And I will send the Egyptians in flight among the nations and wandering through the countries and they will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  Now in the eleventh year in the third month on the first day of the month the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his people Whom are you like in your great power
Eze  See a pinetree with beautiful branches and thick growth giving shade and very tall and its top was among the clouds
Eze  It got strength from the waters and the deep made it tall its streams went round about its planted land and it sent out its waterways to all the trees of the field
Eze  In this way it became taller than all the trees of the field and its branches were increased and its arms became long because of the great waters
Eze  In its branches all the birds of heaven came to rest and under its arms all the beasts of the field gave birth to their young and great nations were living in its shade
Eze  So it was beautiful being so tall and its branches so long for its root was by great waters
Eze  No cedars were equal to it in the garden of God the firtrees were not like its branches and planetrees were as nothing in comparison with its arms no tree in the garden of God was so beautiful
Eze  I made it beautiful with its mass of branches so that all the trees in the garden of God were full of envy of it
Eze  For this cause the Lord has said Because he is tall and has put his top among the clouds and his heart is full of pride because he is so high
Eze  I have given him up into the hands of a strong one of the nations he will certainly give him the reward of his sin driving him out
Eze  And men from strange lands who are to be feared among the nations after cutting him off have let him be on the mountains and in all the valleys his branches have come down his arms are broken by all the waterways of the land all the peoples of the earth have gone from his shade and have let him be
Eze  All the birds of heaven have come to rest on his broken stem where it is stretched on the earth and all the beasts of the field will be on his branches
Eze  In order that no trees by the waters may be lifted up in their growth putting their tops among the clouds and that no trees which are watered may take their place on high for they are all given up to death to the lowest parts of the earth among the children of men with those who go down to the underworld
Eze  This is what the Lord has said The day when he goes down to the underworld I will make the deep full of grief for him I will keep back her streams and the great waters will be stopped I will make Lebanon dark for him and all the trees of the field will be feeble because of him
Eze  I will send shaking on the nations at the sound of his fall when I send him down to the underworld with those who go down into the deep and on earth they will be comforting themselves all the trees of Eden the best of Lebanon even all the watered ones
Eze  And they will go down with him to the underworld to those who have been put to the sword even those who were his helpers living under his shade among the nations
Eze  Whom then are you like for you will be sent down with the trees of Eden into the lowest parts of the earth there you will be stretched out among those without circumcision with those who were put to the sword This is Pharaoh and all his people says the Lord
Eze  And it came about in the twelfth year in the twelfth month on the first day of the month that the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man make a song of grief for Pharaoh king of Egypt and say to him Young lion of the nations destruction has come on you and you were like a seabeast in the seas sending out bursts of water troubling the waters with your feet making their streams dirty
Eze  This is what the Lord has said My net will be stretched out over you and I will take you up in my fishingnet
Eze  And I will let you be stretched on the land I will send you out violently into the open field I will let all the birds of heaven come to rest on you and will make the beasts of all the earth full of you
Eze  And I will put your flesh on the mountains and make the valleys full of your blood
Eze  And the land will be watered with your blood and the waterways will be full of you
Eze  And when I put out your life the heaven will be covered and its stars made dark I will let the sun be covered with a cloud and the moon will not give her light
Eze  All the bright lights of heaven I will make dark over you and put dark night on your land says the Lord
Eze  And the hearts of numbers of peoples will be troubled when I send your prisoners among the nations into a country which is strange to you
Eze  And I will make a number of peoples overcome with wonder at you and their kings will be full of fear because of you when my sword is waved before them they will be shaking every minute every man fearing for his life in the day of your fall
Eze  For this is what the Lord has said The sword of the king of Babylon will come on you
Eze  I will let the swords of the strong be the cause of the fall of your people all of them men to be feared among the nations and they will make waste the pride of Egypt and all its people will come to destruction
Eze  And I will put an end to all her beasts which are by the great waters and they will never again be troubled by the foot of man or by the feet of beasts
Eze  Then I will make their waters clear and their rivers will be flowing like oil says the Lord
Eze  When I make Egypt an unpeopled waste cutting off from the land all the things in it when I send punishment on all those living in it then it will be clear to them that I am the Lord
Eze  It is a song of grief and people will give voice to it the daughters of the nations will give voice to it even for Egypt and all her people says the Lord
Eze  And in the twelfth year on the fifteenth day of the month the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man let your voice be loud in sorrow for the people of Egypt and send them down even you and the daughters of the nations I will send them down into the lowest parts of the earth with those who go down into the underworld
Eze  Are you more beautiful than any go down and take your rest among those without circumcision
Eze  Among those who have been put to the sword they will give a restingplace with them to all their people
Eze  The strong among the great ones will say to him from the underworld Are you more beautiful than any go down you and your helpers and take your rest among those without circumcision and those who have been put to the sword
Eze  There is Asshur and all her army round about her last restingplace all of them put to death by the sword
Eze  Whose restingplaces are in the inmost parts of the underworld who were a cause of fear in the land of the living
Eze  There is Elam and all her people round about her last restingplace all of them put to death by the sword who have gone down without circumcision into the lowest parts of the earth who were a cause of fear in the land of the living and are put to shame with those who go down to the underworld
Eze  They have made a bed for her among the dead and all her people are round about her restingplace all of them without circumcision put to death with the sword for they were a cause of fear in the land of the living and are put to shame with those who go down to the underworld they have been given a place among those who have been put to the sword
Eze  There is Meshech Tubal and all her people round about her last restingplace all of them without circumcision put to death by the sword for they were a cause of fear in the land of the living
Eze  And they have been put to rest with the fighting men who came to their end in days long past who went down to the underworld with their instruments of war placing their swords under their heads and their bodycovers are over their bones for their strength was a cause of fear in the land of the living
Eze  But you will have your bed among those without circumcision and will be put to rest with those who have been put to death with the sword
Eze  There is Edom her kings and all her princes who have been given a restingplace with those who were put to the sword they will be resting among those without circumcision even with those who go down to the underworld
Eze  There are the chiefs of the north all of them and all the Zidonians who have gone down with those who have been put to the sword they are shamed on account of all the fear caused by their strength they are resting there without circumcision among those who have been put to the sword and are put to shame with those who go down to the underworld
Eze  Pharaoh will see them and be comforted on account of all his people even Pharaoh and all his army put to death by the sword says the Lord
Eze  For he put his fear in the land of the living and he will be put to rest among those without circumcision with those who have been put to death with the sword even Pharaoh and all his people says the Lord
Eze  And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man give a word to the children of your people and say to them When I make the sword come on a land if the people of the land take a man from among their number and make him their watchman
Eze  If when he sees the sword coming on the land by sounding the horn he gives the people news of their danger
Eze  Then anyone who hearing the sound of the horn does not take note of it will himself be responsible for his death if the sword comes and takes him away
Eze  On hearing the sound of the horn he did not take note his blood will be on him for if he had taken note his life would have been safe
Eze  But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not give a note on the horn and the people have no word of the danger and the sword comes and takes any person from among them he will be taken away in his sin but I will make the watchman responsible for his blood
Eze  So you son of man I have made you a watchman for the children of Israel and you are to give ear to the word of my mouth and give them news from me of their danger
Eze  When I say to the evildoer Death will certainly overtake you and you say nothing to make clear to the evildoer the danger of his way death will overtake that evil man in his evildoing but I will make you responsible for his blood
Eze  But if you make clear to the evildoer the danger of his way for the purpose of turning him from it and he is not turned from his way death will overtake him in his evildoing but your life will be safe
Eze  And you son of man say to the children of Israel You say Our wrongdoing and our sins are on us and we are wasting away in them how then may we have life
Eze  Say to them By my life says the Lord I have no pleasure in the death of the evildoer it is more pleasing to me if he is turned from his way and has life be turned be turned from your evil ways why are you looking for death O children of Israel
Eze  And you son of man say to the children of your people The righteousness of the upright man will not make him safe in the day when he does wrong and the evildoing of the evil man will not be the cause of his fall in the day when he is turned from his evildoing and the upright man will not have life because of his righteousness in the day when he does evil
Eze  When I say to the upright that life will certainly be his if he puts his faith in his righteousness and does evil not one of his upright acts will be kept in memory but in the evil he has done death will overtake him
Eze  And when I say to the evildoer Death will certainly be your fate if he is turned from his sin and does what is ordered and right
Eze  If the evildoer lets one who is in his debt have back what is his and gives back what he had taken by force and is guided by the rules of life doing no evil life will certainly be his death will not overtake him
Eze  Not one of the sins which he has done will be kept in mind against him he has done what is ordered and right life will certainly be his
Eze  But the children of your people say The way of the Lord is not equal when it is they whose way is not equal
Eze  When the upright man turning away from his righteousness does evil death will overtake him in it
Eze  And when the evil man turning away from his evildoing does what is ordered and right he will get life by it
Eze  And still you say The way of the Lord is not equal O children of Israel I will be your judge giving to everyone the reward of his ways
Eze  Now in the twelfth year after we had been taken away prisoners in the tenth month on the fifth day of the month one who had got away in flight from Jerusalem came to me saying The town has been taken
Eze  Now the hand of the Lord had been on me in the evening before the man who had got away came to me and he made my mouth open ready for his coming to me in the morning and my mouth was open and I was no longer without voice
Eze  And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man those who are living in these waste places in the land of Israel say Abraham was but one and he had land for his heritage but we are a great number the land is given to us for our heritage
Eze  For this cause say to them This is what the Lord has said You take your meat with the blood your eyes are lifted up to your images and you are takers of life are you to have the land for your heritage
Eze  You put your faith in your swords you do disgusting things everyone takes his neighbours wife are you to have the land for your heritage
Eze  This is what you are to say to them The Lord has said By my life truly those who are in the waste places will be put to the sword and him who is in the open field I will give to the beasts for their food and those who are in the strong places and in holes in the rocks will come to their death by disease
Eze  And I will make the land a waste and a cause of wonder and the pride of her strength will come to an end and the mountains of Israel will be made waste so that no one will go through
Eze  Then they will be certain that I am the Lord when I have made the land a waste and a cause of wonder because of all the disgusting things which they have done
Eze  And as for you son of man the children of your people are talking together about you by the walls and in the doorways of the houses saying to one another Come now give ear to the word which comes from the Lord
Eze  And they come to you as my people come and are seated before you as my people hearing your words but doing them not for deceit is in their mouth and their heart goes after profit for themselves
Eze  And truly you are to them like a love song by one who has a very pleasing voice and is an expert player on an instrument for they give ear to your words but do them not
Eze  And when this comes about see it is coming then it will be clear to them that a prophet has been among them
Eze  And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man be a prophet against the keepers of the flock of Israel and say to them O keepers of the sheep this is the word of the Lord A curse is on the keepers of the flock of Israel who take the food for themselves is it not right for the keepers to give the food to the sheep
Eze  You take the milk and are clothed with the wool you put the fat beasts to death but you give the sheep no food
Eze  You have not made the diseased ones strong or made well that which was ill you have not put bands on the broken or got back that which had been sent away or made search for the wandering ones and the strong you have been ruling cruelly
Eze  And they were wandering in every direction because there was no keeper and they became food for all the beasts of the field
Eze  And my sheep went out of the way wandering through all the mountains and on every high hill my sheep went here and there over all the face of the earth and no one was troubled about them or went in search of them
Eze  For this cause O keepers of the flock give ear to the word of the Lord
Eze  By my life says the Lord truly because my sheep have been taken away and my sheep became food for all the beasts of the field because there was no keeper and my keepers did not go in search of the sheep but the keepers took food for themselves and gave my sheep no food
Eze  For this reason O you keepers of the flock give ear to the word of the Lord
Eze  This is what the Lord has said See I am against the keepers of the flock and I will make search and see what they have done with my sheep and will let them be keepers of my sheep no longer and the keepers will no longer get food for themselves I will take my sheep out of their mouths so that they may not be food for them
Eze  For this is what the Lord has said Truly I even I will go searching and looking for my sheep
Eze  As the keeper goes looking for his flock when he is among his wandering sheep so I will go looking for my sheep and will get them safely out of all the places where they have been sent wandering in the day of clouds and black night
Eze  And I will take them out from among the peoples and get them together from the countries and will take them into their land and I will give them food on the mountains of Israel by the waterstreams and wherever men are living in the country
Eze  I will give them good grassland for their food and their safe place will be the mountains of the high place of Israel there they will take their rest in a good place and on fat grassland they will take their food on the mountains of Israel
Eze  I myself will give food to my flock and I will give them rest says the Lord
Eze  I will go in search of that which had gone wandering from the way and will get back that which had been sent in flight and will put bands on that which was broken and give strength to that which was ill but the fat and the strong I will give up to destruction I will give them for their food the punishment which is theirs by right
Eze  And as for you O my flock says the Lord truly I will be judge between sheep and sheep the hesheep and the hegoats
Eze  Does it seem a small thing to you to have taken your food on good grassland while the rest of your grassland is stamped down under your feet and that after drinking from clear waters you make the rest of the waters dirty with your feet
Eze  And as for my sheep their food is the grass which has been stamped on by your feet and their drink the water which has been made dirty by your feet
Eze  For this reason the Lord has said to them Truly I even I will be judge between the fat sheep and the thin sheep
Eze  Because you have been pushing with side and leg pushing the diseased with your horns till they were sent away in every direction
Eze  I will make my flock safe and they will no longer be taken away and I will be judge between sheep and sheep
Eze  And I will put over them one keeper and he will give them food even my servant David he will give them food and be their keeper
Eze  And I the Lord will be their God and my servant David their ruler I the Lord have said it
Eze  And I will make with them an agreement of peace and will put an end to evil beasts through all the land and they will be living safely in the waste land sleeping in the woods
Eze  And I will give the rain at the right time and I will make the shower come down at the right time there will be showers of blessing
Eze  And the tree of the field will give its fruit and the earth will give its increase and they will be safe in their land and they will be certain that I am the Lord when I have had their yoke broken and have given them salvation from the hands of those who made them servants
Eze  And their goods will no longer be taken by the nations and they will not again be food for the beasts of the earth but they will be living safely and no one will be a cause of fear to them
Eze  And I will give them plantingplaces of peace and they will no longer be wasted from need of food or put to shame by the nations
Eze  And they will be certain that I the Lord their God am with them and that they the children of Israel are my people says the Lord
Eze  And you are my sheep the sheep of my grasslands and I am your God says the Lord
Eze  Then the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man let your face be turned to Mount Seir and be a prophet against it
Eze  And say to it This is what the Lord has said See I am against you O Mount Seir and my hand will be stretched out against you and I will make you a waste and a cause for wonder
Eze  I will make your towns unpeopled and you will be a waste and you will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  Because yours has been a hate without end and you have given up the children of Israel to the power of the sword in the time of their trouble in the time of the punishment of the end
Eze  For this cause by my life says the Lord because you have been sinning through blood blood will come after you
Eze  And I will make Mount Seir a cause for wonder and a waste cutting off from it all comings and goings
Eze  I will make his mountains full of those who have been put to death in your valleys and in all your waterstreams men will be falling by the sword
Eze  I will make you waste for ever and your towns will be unpeopled and you will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  Because you have said The two nations and the two countries are to be mine and we will take them for our heritage though the Lord was there
Eze  For this cause by my life says the Lord I will do to you as you have done in your wrath and in your envy which you have made clear in your hate for them and I will make clear to you who I am when you are judged by me
Eze  And you will see that I the Lord have had knowledge of all the bitter things which you have said against the mountains of Israel saying They have been made waste they are given to us to take for our heritage
Eze  And you have made yourselves great against me with your mouths increasing your words against me and it has come to my ears
Eze  This is what the Lord has said Because you were glad over my land when it was a waste so will I do to you
Eze  You will become a waste O Mount Seir and all Edom even all of it and you will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  And you son of man be a prophet about the mountains of Israel and say You mountains of Israel give ear to the word of the Lord
Eze  This is what the Lord has said Because your hater has said against you Aha and The old waste places are our heritage we have taken them
Eze  For this cause be a prophet and say This is what the Lord has said Because even because they have been glad over you and put you to shame on every side because you have become a heritage for the rest of the nations and you are taken up on the lips of talkers and in the evil talk of the people
Eze  For this reason you mountains of Israel give ear to the word of the Lord this is what the Lord has said to the mountains and to the hills to the streams and to the valleys to the unpeopled wastes and to the towns where no one is living from which the goods have been taken and which have been put to shame by the rest of the nations who are round about
Eze  For this cause the Lord has said Truly in the heat of my bitter feeling I have said things against the rest of the nations and against all Edom who have taken my land as a heritage for themselves with the joy of all their heart and with bitter envy of soul have made attacks on it
Eze  For this cause be a prophet about the land of Israel and say to the mountains and to the hills to the streams and to the valleys This is what the Lord has said Truly in my bitter feeling and in my wrath I have said these things because you have undergone the shame of the nations
Eze  For this cause the Lord has said See I have taken an oath that the nations which are round about you are themselves to undergo the shame which they have put on you
Eze  But you O mountains of Israel will put out your branches and give your fruit to my people Israel for they are ready to come
Eze  For truly I am for you and I will be turned to you and you will be ploughed and planted
Eze  And I will let your numbers be increased all the children of Israel even all of them and the towns will be peopled and the waste places will have buildings
Eze  Man and beast will be increased in you and they will have offspring and be fertile I will make you thickly peopled as you were before and will do more for you than at the first and you will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  Yes I will have you walked on by the feet of men even my people Israel they will have you for a heritage and you will be theirs and never again will you take their children from them
Eze  This is what the Lord has said Because they say to you You O land are the destruction of men causing loss of children to your nation
Eze  For this reason you will no longer take the lives of men and will never again be the cause of loss of children to your nation says the Lord
Eze  And I will not let the shaming of the nations come to your ears and no longer will you be looked down on by the peoples says the Lord
Eze  Then the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man when the children of Israel were living in their land they made it unclean by their way and their acts their way before me was as when a woman is unclean at the time when she is kept separate
Eze  So I let loose my wrath on them because of those whom they had violently put to death in the land and because they had made it unclean with their images
Eze  And I sent them in flight among the nations and wandering through the countries I was their judge rewarding them for their way and their acts
Eze  And when they came among the nations wherever they went they made my holy name unclean when it was said of them These are the people of the Lord who have gone out from his land
Eze  But I had pity for my holy name which the children of Israel had made unclean wherever they went
Eze  For this cause say to the children of Israel This is what the Lord has said I am doing this not because of you O children of Israel but because of my holy name which you have made unclean among the nations wherever you went
Eze  And I will make holy my great name which has been made unclean among the nations which you have made unclean among them and it will be clear to the nations that I am the Lord says the Lord when I make myself holy in you before their eyes
Eze  For I will take you out from among the nations and get you together from all the countries and take you into your land
Eze  And I will put clean water on you so that you may be clean from all your unclean ways and from all your images I will make you clean
Eze  And I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you I will take away the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh
Eze  And I will put my spirit in you causing you to be guided by my rules and you will keep my orders and do them
Eze  So that you may go on living in the land which I gave to your fathers and you will be to me a people and I will be to you a God
Eze  And I will make you free from all your unclean ways and at my voice the grain will come up and be increased and I will not let you be short of food
Eze  And I will make the tree give more fruit and the field fuller produce and no longer will you be shamed among the nations for need of food
Eze  And at the memory of your evil ways and your wrongdoings you will have bitter hate for yourselves because of your evildoings and your disgusting ways O children of Israel
Eze  Not because of you am I doing it says the Lord let it be clear to you and be shamed and made low because of your ways O children of Israel
Eze  This is what the Lord has said In the day when I make you clean from all your evildoings I will let the towns be peopled and there will be building on the waste places
Eze  And the land which was waste will be farmed in place of being a waste in the eyes of everyone who went by
Eze  And they will say This land which was waste has become like the garden of Eden and the towns which were unpeopled and wasted and pulled down are walled and peopled
Eze  Then the rest of the nations round about you will be certain that I the Lord am the builder of the places which were pulled down and the planter of that which was waste I the Lord have said it and I will do it
Eze  This is what the Lord has said The children of Israel will again make prayer to me for this that I may do it for them I will make them increased with men like a flock
Eze  Like sheep for the offerings like the sheep of Jerusalem at her fixed feasts so the unpeopled towns will be made full of men and they will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  The hand of the Lord had been on me and he took me out in the spirit of the Lord and put me down in the middle of the valley and it was full of bones
Eze  And he made me go past them round about and I saw that there was a very great number of them on the face of the wide valley and they were very dry
Eze  And he said to me Son of man is it possible for these bones to come to life And I made answer and said It is for you to say O Lord
Eze  And again he said to me Be a prophet to these bones and say to them O you dry bones give ear to the word of the Lord
Eze  This is what the Lord has said to these bones See I will make breath come into you so that you may come to life
Eze  And I will put muscles on you and make flesh come on you and put skin over you and breath into you so that you may have life and you will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  So I gave the word as I was ordered and at my words there was a shaking of the earth and the bones came together bone to bone
Eze  And looking I saw that there were muscles on them and flesh came up and they were covered with skin but there was no breath in them
Eze  And he said to me Be a prophet to the wind be a prophet son of man and say to the wind The Lord has said Come from the four winds O wind breathing on these dead so that they may come to life
Eze  And I gave the word at his orders and breath came into them and they came to life and got up on their feet a very great army
Eze  Then he said to me Son of man these bones are all the children of Israel and see they are saying Our bones have become dry our hope is gone we are cut off completely
Eze  For this cause be a prophet to them and say This is what the Lord has said See I am opening the restingplaces of your dead and I will make you come up out of your restingplaces O my people and I will take you into the land of Israel
Eze  And you will be certain that I am the Lord by my opening the restingplaces of your dead and making you come up out of your restingplaces O my people
Eze  And I will put my spirit in you so that you may come to life and I will give you a rest in your land and you will be certain that I the Lord have said it and have done it says the Lord
Eze  And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  And you son of man take one stick writing on it For Judah and for the children of Israel who are in his company then take another stick writing on it For Joseph the stick of Ephraim and all the children of Israel who are in his company
Eze  Then joining them one to another make them one stick so that they may be one in your hand
Eze  And when the children of your people say to you Will you not make clear to us what these things have to do with us
Eze  Then say to them This is what the Lord has said See I am taking the stick of Joseph which is in the hand of Ephraim and the tribes of Israel who are in his company and I will put it on the stick of Judah and make them one stick and they will be one in my hand
Eze  And the sticks with your writing on them will be in your hand before their eyes
Eze  And say to them These are the words of the Lord See I am taking the children of Israel from among the nations where they have gone and will get them together on every side and take them into their land
Eze  And I will make them one nation in the land on the mountains of Israel and one king will be king over them all and they will no longer be two nations and will no longer be parted into two kingdoms
Eze  And they will no longer make themselves unclean with their images or with their hated things or with any of their sins but I will give them salvation from all their turning away in which they have done evil and will make them clean and they will be to me a people and I will be to them a God
Eze  And my servant David will be king over them and they will all have one keeper and they will be guided by my orders and will keep my rules and do them
Eze  And they will be living in the land which I gave to Jacob my servant in which your fathers were living and they will go on living there they and their children and their childrens children for ever and David my servant will be their ruler for ever
Eze  And I will make an agreement of peace with them it will be an eternal agreement with them and I will have mercy on them and make their numbers great and will put my holy place among them for ever
Eze  And my House will be over them and I will be to them a God and they will be to me a people
Eze  And the nations will be certain that I who make Israel holy am the Lord when my holy place is among them for ever
Eze  And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Eze  Son of man let your face be turned against Gog of the land of Magog the ruler of Rosh Meshech and Tubal and be a prophet against him
Eze  And say This is what the Lord has said See I am against you O Gog ruler of Rosh Meshech and Tubal
Eze  And turning you round I will put hooks in your mouth and make you come out with all your army horses and horsemen all of them in full wardress a great force with breastplate and bodycover all of them armed with swords
Eze  Persia Cush and Put with them all of them with bodycover and metal headdress
Eze  Gomer and all her forces the people of Togarmah in the inmost parts of the north with all his forces a great number of peoples with you
Eze  Be ready make yourself ready you and all the forces who are with you and be ready for my orders
Eze  After a long time you will get your orders in the last years you will come into the land which has been given back from the sword which has been got together out of a great number of peoples on the mountains of Israel which have ever been a waste but it has been taken out from the peoples and they will be living all of them without fear of danger
Eze  And you will go up you will come like a storm you will be like a cloud covering the land you and all your forces and a great number of peoples with you
Eze  This is what the Lord has said In that day it will come about that things will come into your mind and you will have thoughts of an evil design
Eze  And you will say I will go up to the land of small unwalled towns I will go to those who are quiet living all of them without fear of danger without walls or locks or doors
Eze  To take their property by force and go off with their goods turning your hand against the waste places which now are peopled and against the people who have been got together out of the nations who have got cattle and goods for themselves who are living in the middle of the earth
Eze  Sheba and Dedan and her traders Tarshish with all her traders will say to you Have you come to take our goods have you got your armies together to take away our property by force to take away silver and gold cattle and goods to go off with great wealth
Eze  For this cause son of man be a prophet and say to Gog These are the words of the Lord In that day when my people Israel are living without fear of danger will you not be moved against them
Eze  And you will come from your place in the inmost parts of the north you and a great number of peoples with you all of them on horseback a great force and a strong army
Eze  And you will come up against my people Israel like a cloud covering the land and it will come about in the last days that I will make you come against my land so that the nations may have knowledge of me when I make myself holy in you O Gog before their eyes
Eze  This is what the Lord has said You are he of whom I gave them word in earlier times by my servants the prophets of Israel who in those days went on saying year after year that I would make you come up against them
Eze  And it will come about in that day when Gog comes up against the land of Israel says the Lord that my wrath will come up and my passion and my bitter feeling
Eze  For in the fire of my wrath I have said Truly in that day there will be a great shaking in the land of Israel
Eze  So that the fish of the sea and the birds of heaven and the beasts of the field and everything moving on the earth and all the men who are on the face of the earth will be shaking before me and the mountains will be overturned and the high places will come down and every wall will come falling down to the earth
Eze  And I will send to all my mountains for a sword against him says the Lord every mans sword will be against his brother
Eze  And I will take up my cause against him with disease and with blood and I will send down on him and on his forces and on the peoples who are with him an overflowing shower and great icedrops fire and burning
Eze  And I will make my name great and make myself holy and I will make myself clear to a number of nations and they will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  And you son of man be a prophet against Gog and say These are the words of the Lord See I am against you O Gog ruler of Rosh Meshech and Tubal
Eze  And turning you round I will be your guide and make you come up from the inmost parts of the north I will make you come on to the mountains of Israel
Eze  And with a blow I will send your bow out of your left hand and your arrows falling from your right hand
Eze  On the mountains of Israel you will come down you and all your forces and the peoples who are with you I will give you to cruel birds of every sort and to the beasts of the field to be their food
Eze  You will come down in the open field for I have said it says the Lord
Eze  And I will send a fire on Magog and on those who are living in the sealands without fear and they will be certain that I am the Lord
Eze  And I will make clear my holy name among my people Israel I will no longer let my holy name be made unclean and the nations will be certain that I am the Lord the Holy One in Israel
Eze  See it is coming and it will be done says the Lord this is the day of which I have given word
Eze  And those who are living in the towns of Israel will go out and make fires of the instruments of war burning the bodycovers and the breastplates the bows and the arrows and the sticks and the spears and for seven years they will make fires of them
Eze  And they will take no wood out of the field or have any cut down in the woods for they will make their fires of the instruments of war and they will take by force the property of those who took their property and go off with the goods of those who took their goods says the Lord
Eze  And it will come about in those days that I will give to Gog a last restingplace there in Israel in the valley of Abarim on the east of the sea and those who go through will be stopped and there Gog and all his people will be put to rest and the place will be named The valley of Hamongog
Eze  And the children of Israel will be seven months putting them in the earth so as to make the land clean
Eze  And all the people of the land will put them in the earth and it will be to their honour in the day when I let my glory be seen says the Lord
Eze  And they will put on one side men to do no other work but to go through the land and put in the earth the rest of those who are still on the face of the land to make it clean after seven months are ended they are to make a search
Eze  And while they go through the land if anyone sees a mans bone he is to put up a sign by the place till those who are doing the work have put it in the earth in the valley of Hamongog
Eze  And there they will put all the army of Gog in the earth So they will make the land clean
Eze  And you son of man this is what the Lord has said Say to the birds of every sort and to all the beasts of the field Get together and come come together on every side to the offering which I am putting to death for you a great offering on the mountains of Israel so that you may have flesh for your food and blood for your drink
Eze  The flesh of the men of war will be your food and your drink the blood of the princes of the earth of sheep and lambs of hegoats of oxen all of them fat beasts of Bashan
Eze  You will go on feasting on the fat till you are full and drinking the blood till you are overcome with it of my offering which I have put to death for you
Eze  At my table you will have food in full measure horses and warcarriages great men and all the men of war says the Lord
Eze  And I will put my glory among the nations and all the nations will see my punishments which I have put into effect and my hand which I have put on them
Eze  So the children of Israel will be certain that I am the Lord their God from that day and for the future
Eze  And it will be clear to the nations that the children of Israel were taken away prisoners for their evildoing because they did wrong against me and my face was covered from them so I gave them up into the hands of their attackers and they all came to their end by the sword
Eze  In the measure of their unclean ways and their sins so I did to them and I kept my face covered from them
Eze  For this cause the Lord has said Now I will let the fate of Jacob be changed and I will have mercy on all the children of Israel and will take care of the honour of my holy name
Eze  And they will be conscious of their shame and of all the wrong which they have done against me when they are living in their land with no sense of danger and with no one to be a cause of fear to them
Eze  When I have taken them back from among the peoples and got them together out of the lands of their haters and have made myself holy in them before the eyes of a great number of nations
Eze  And they will be certain that I am the Lord their God because I sent them away as prisoners among the nations and have taken them together back to their land and I have not let one of them be there any longer
Eze  And my face will no longer be covered from them for I have sent the outflowing of my spirit on the children of Israel says the Lord
Eze  In the twentyfifth year after we had been taken away prisoners in the first month of the year on the tenth day of the month in the fourteenth year after the town was taken on the very same day the hand of the Lord was on me and he took me there
Eze  In the visions of God he took me into the land of Israel and put me down on a very high mountain on which there was as it seemed a building like a town opposite me
Eze  He took me there and I saw a man looking like brass with a linen cord in his hand and a measuring rod and he was stationed in the doorway

Eze  And the siderooms room over room were three times thirty there were inlets in the wall of the house for the siderooms round about for supports in the wall of the house
Eze  The siderooms became wider as they went higher up the house by the amount of the space let into the wall up round about the house because of the inlets in the house and one went up from the lowest floor by steps to the middle and from the middle to the upper floor

Eze  And he took me to the south and in front of the separate place and in front of the building there were rooms
Eze  And there was a walk in front of them like that by the rooms on the north they were equally long and wide and the ways out of them were the same in design and had the same sort of doors
Eze  And under the rooms on the south was a door at the head of the outer wall in the direction of the east as one goes in
Eze  And he said to me The north rooms and the south rooms in front of the separate place are the holy rooms where the priests who come near the Lord take the most holy things for their food there the most holy things are placed with the meal offering and the sinoffering and the offering for error for the place is holy
Eze  When the priests go in they may not go out of the holy place into the outer square and there they are to put the robes in which they do the work of the Lords house for they are holy and they have to put on other clothing before they come near that which has to do with the people
Eze  And when he had come to the end of measuring the inner house he took me out to the doorway looking to the east and took its measure all round
Eze  He went round and took the measure of it on the east side with the measuring rod five hundred measured with the rod all round
Eze  And he went round and took the measure of it on the north side with the measuring rod five hundred measured with the rod all round
Eze  And he went round and took the measure of it on the south side with the measuring rod five hundred measured with the rod all round
Eze  And he went round and took the measure of it on the west side with the measuring rod five hundred measured with the rod all round
Eze  He took its measure on the four sides and it had a wall all round five hundred long and five hundred wide separating what was holy from what was common
Eze  And he took me to the doorway looking to the east
Eze  And there was the glory of the God of Israel coming from the way of the east and his voice was like the sound of great waters and the earth was shining with his glory
Eze  And the vision which I saw was like the vision I had seen when he came for the destruction of the town and like the vision which I saw by the river Chebar and I went down on my face
Eze  And the glory of the Lord came into the house by the way of the doorway looking to the east
Eze  And the spirit lifting me up took me into the inner square and I saw that the house was full of the glory of the Lord
Eze  And the voice of one talking to me came to my ears from inside the house and the man was by my side
Eze  And he said to me Son of man this is the place where the seat of my power is and the restingplace of my feet where I will be among the children of Israel for ever and no longer will the people of Israel make my holy name unclean they or their kings by their loose ways and by the dead bodies of their kings
Eze  By putting their doorstep by my doorstep and the pillar of their door by the pillar of my door with only a wall between me and them and they have made my holy name unclean by the disgusting things which they have done so in my wrath I sent destruction on them
Eze  Now let them put their loose ways and the dead bodies of their kings far from me and I will be among them for ever
Eze  You son of man give the children of Israel an account of this house so that they may be shamed because of their evildoing and let them see the vision of it and its image
Eze  And they will be shamed by what they have done so give them the knowledge of the form of the house and its structure and the ways out of it and into it and all its laws and its rules writing it down for them so that they may keep all its laws and do them
Eze  This is the law of the house On the top of the mountain all the space round it on every side will be most holy See this is the law of the house
Eze  And these are the measures of the altar in cubits the cubit being a cubit and a hands measure its hollow base is a cubit high and a cubit wide and it has an overhanging edge as wide as a handstretch all round it
Eze  And from the base on the earth level to the lower shelf the altar is two cubits high and a cubit wide and from the smaller shelf to the greater shelf it is four cubits high and a cubit wide
Eze  And the fireplace is four cubits high and coming up from the fireplace are the horns a cubit high
Eze  And the fireplace is twelve cubits long and twelve cubits wide square on its four sides
Eze  And the shelf is fourteen cubits long and fourteen cubits wide on its four sides the edge round it is half a cubit the base of it is a cubit all round and its steps are facing the east
Eze  And he said to me Son of man the Lord God has said These are the rules for the altar when they make it for the offering of burned offerings on it and the draining out of the blood
Eze  You are to give to the priests the Levites of the seed of Zadok who come near to me says the Lord God to do my work a young ox for a sinoffering
Eze  You are to take some of its blood and put it on the four horns and on the four angles of the shelf and on the edge all round and you are to make it clean and free from sin
Eze  And you are to take the ox of the sinoffering and have it burned in the special place ordered for it in the house outside the holy place
Eze  And on the second day you are to have a hegoat without any mark on it offered for a sinoffering and they are to make the altar clean as they did with the young ox
Eze  And after you have made it clean let a young ox without a mark be offered and a male sheep from the flock without a mark
Eze  And you are to take them before the Lord and the priests will put salt on them offering them up for a burned offering to the Lord
Eze  Every day for seven days you are to give a goat for a sinoffering and let them give in addition a young ox and a male sheep from the flock without any mark on them
Eze  For seven days they are to make offerings to take away sin from the altar and to make it clean so they are to make it holy
Eze  And when these days have come to an end then on the eighth day and after the priests will make your burned offerings on the altar and your peaceofferings and I will take pleasure in you says the Lord
Eze  And he took me back to the outer doorway of the holy place looking to the east and it was shut
Eze  And the Lord said to me This doorway is to be shut it is not to be open and no man is to go in by it because the Lord the God of Israel has gone in by it and it is to be shut
Eze  But the ruler will be seated there to take his food before the Lord he will go in by the covered way to the door and will come out by the same way
Eze  And he took me to the north doorway in front of the house and looking I saw that the house of the Lord was full of the glory of the Lord and I went down on my face
Eze  And the Lord said to me Son of man take to heart and let your eyes see and your ears be open to everything I say to you about all the rules of the house of the Lord and all its laws and take note of the ways into the house and all the ways out of the holy place
Eze  And say to the uncontrolled children of Israel This is what the Lord has said O you children of Israel let it be enough for you among the disgusting things which you have done
Eze  To have let men from strange lands without circumcision of heart or flesh come into my holy place making my house unclean and to have made the offering of my food even the fat and the blood and in addition to all your disgusting ways you have let my agreement be broken
Eze  And you have not taken care of my holy things but you have put them as keepers to take care of my work in my holy place
Eze  For this cause the Lord has said No man from a strange land without circumcision of heart and flesh of all those who are living among the children of Israel is to come into my holy place
Eze  But as for the Levites who went far from me when Israel went out of the right way turning away from me to go after their images their punishment will come on them
Eze  But they may be caretakers in my holy place and overseers at the doors of the house doing the work of the house they will put to death the burned offering and the beasts offered for the people and they will take their place before them as their servants
Eze  Because they did this work for them before their images and became a cause of sin to the children of Israel for this cause my hand has been lifted up against them says the Lord and their punishment will be on them
Eze  And they will not come near me to do the work of priests to me or come near any of my holy things or the things which are most holy but their shame will be on them and the punishment for the disgusting things which they have done
Eze  But I will make them responsible for the care of the house and all its work and everything which is done in it
Eze  But as for the priests the sons of Zadok who took care of my holy place when the children of Israel were turned away from me they are to come near me to do my work they will take their places before me offering to me the fat and the blood says the Lord
Eze  They are to come into my holy place and they are to come near to my table to do my work and have the care of my house
Eze  And when they come in by the doorways of the inner square they are to be clothed in linen robes there is to be no wool on them while they are doing my work in the doorway of the inner square and inside the house
Eze  They are to have linen headdresses on their heads and linen trousers on their legs and they are to have nothing round them to make their skin wet with heat
Eze  And when they go out into the outer square to the people they are to take off the robes in which they do the work of priests and put them away in the holy rooms and put on other clothing so that the people may not be made holy by their robes
Eze  They are not to have all the hair cut off their heads and they are not to let their hair get long but they are to have the ends of their hair cut
Eze  The priests are not to take wine when they go into the inner square
Eze  And they are not to take as wives any widow or woman whose husband has put her away but they may take virgins of the seed of Israel or a widow who is the widow of a priest
Eze  And they are to make clear to my people the division between what is holy and what is common and to give them the knowledge of what is clean and what is unclean
Eze  In any cause they are to be in the position of judges judging in harmony with my decisions they are to keep my laws and my rules in all my fixed feasts and they are to keep my Sabbaths holy
Eze  They are not to come near any dead person so as to become unclean but for a father or mother or son or daughter or brother or for a sister who has no husband they may make themselves unclean
Eze  And after he has been made clean seven days are to be numbered for him
Eze  And on the day when he goes into the inner square to do the work of the holy place he is to make his sinoffering says the Lord
Eze  And they are to have no heritage I am their heritage you are to give them no property in Israel I am their property
Eze  Their food is to be the meal offering and the sinoffering and the offering for error and everything given specially to the Lord in Israel will be theirs
Eze  And the best of all the firstfruits of everything and every offering which is lifted up of all your offerings will be for the priests and you are to give the priest the first of your breadmaking so causing a blessing to come on your house
Eze  The priests may not take for food any bird or beast which has come to a natural death or whose death has been caused by another animal
Eze  And when you are making a distribution of the land by the decision of the Lord for your heritage you are to make an offering to the Lord of a part of the land as holy it is to be twentyfive thousand long and twenty thousand wide all the land inside these limits is to be holy
Eze  Of this a square five hundred long and five hundred wide is to be for the holy place with a space of fifty cubits all round it
Eze  And of this measure let a space be measured twentyfive thousand long and ten thousand wide in it there will be the holy place even the most holy
Eze  This holy part of the land is to be for the priests the servants of the holy place who come near to the Lord to do his work it is to be a place for their houses and for grassland and for cattle
Eze  A space of land twentyfive thousand long and ten thousand wide is to be for the Levites the servants of the house a property for themselves for towns for their livingplaces
Eze  And as the property for the town you are to have a part five thousand wide and twentyfive thousand long by the side of the offering of the holy part of the land this is to be for all the children of Israel
Eze  And for the ruler there is to be a part on one side and on the other side of the holy offering and of the property of the town in front of the holy offering and in front of the property of the town on the west of it and on the east measured in the same line as one of the parts of the land from its limit on the west to its limit on the east of the land
Eze  And this will be his heritage in Israel and my rulers will no longer be cruel masters to my people but they will give the land as a heritage to the children of Israel by their tribes
Eze  This is what the Lord has said Let this be enough for you O rulers of Israel let there be an end of violent behaviour and wasting do what is right judging uprightly let there be no more driving out of my people says the Lord
Eze  Have true scales and a true ephah and a true bath
Eze  The ephah and the bath are to be of the same measure so that the bath is equal to a tenth of a homer and the ephah to a tenth of a homer the unit of measure is to be a homer
Eze  And the shekel is to be twenty gerahs five shekels are five and ten shekels are ten and your maneh is to be fifty shekels
Eze  This is the offering you are to give a sixth of an ephah out of a homer of wheat and a sixth of an ephah out of a homer of barley
Eze  And the fixed measure of oil is to be a tenth of a bath from the cor for ten baths make up the cor
Eze  And one lamb from the flock out of every two hundred from all the families of Israel for a meal offering and for a burned offering and for peaceofferings to take away their sin says the Lord
Eze  All the people are to give this offering to the ruler
Eze  And the ruler will be responsible for the burned offering and the meal offering and the drink offering at the feasts and the new moons and the Sabbaths at all the fixed feasts of the children of Israel he will give the sinoffering and meal offering and burned offering and the peaceofferings to take away the sin of the children of Israel
Eze  This is what the Lord has said In the first month on the first day of the month you are to take a young ox without any mark on him and you are to make the holy place clean
Eze  And the priest is to take some of the blood of the sinoffering and put it on the uprights at the sides of the doors of the house and on the four angles of the shelf of the altar and on the sides of the doorway of the inner square
Eze  And this you are to do on the seventh day of the month for everyone who is in error and for the feebleminded you are to make the house free from sin
Eze  In the first month on the fourteenth day of the month you are to have the Passover a feast of seven days unleavened bread is to be your food
Eze  And on that day the ruler is to give for himself and for all the people of the land an ox for a sinoffering
Eze  And on the seven days of the feast he is to give a burned offering to the Lord seven oxen and seven sheep without any mark on them every day for seven days and a hegoat every day for a sinoffering
Eze  And he is to give a meal offering an ephah for every ox and an ephah for every sheep and a hin of oil to every ephah
Eze  In the seventh month on the fifteenth day of the month at the feast he is to give the same for seven days the sinoffering the burned offering the meal offering and the oil as before
Eze  This is what the Lord has said The doorway of the inner square looking to the east is to be shut on the six working days but on the Sabbath it is to be open and at the time of the new moon it is to be open
Eze  And the ruler is to go in through the covered way of the outer doorway outside and take his place by the pillar of the doorway and the priests will make his burned offering and his peaceofferings and he will give worship at the doorstep of the doorway then he will go out and the door will not be shut till the evening
Eze  And the people of the land are to give worship at the door of that doorway before the Lord on the Sabbaths and at the new moons
Eze  And the burned offering offered to the Lord by the ruler on the Sabbath day is to be six lambs without a mark on them and a male sheep without a mark
Eze  And the meal offering is to be an ephah for the sheep and for the lambs whatever he is able to give and a hin of oil to an ephah
Eze  And at the time of the new moon it is to be a young ox of the herd without a mark on him and six lambs and a male sheep all without a mark
Eze  And he is to give a meal offering an ephah for the ox and an ephah for the sheep and for the lambs whatever he is able to give and a hin of oil to an ephah
Eze  And when the ruler comes in he is to go in through the covered way of the doorway and he is to go out by the same way
Eze  But when the people of the land come before the Lord at the fixed feasts he who comes in by the north doorway to give worship is to go out by the south doorway and he who comes in by the south doorway is to go out by the north doorway he is not to come back by the doorway through which he went in but is to go straight before him
Eze  And the ruler when they come in is to come among them and is to go out when they go out
Eze  At the feasts and the fixed meetings the meal offerings are to be an ephah for an ox and an ephah for a male sheep and for the lambs whatever he is able to give and a hin of oil to an ephah
Eze  And when the ruler makes a free offering a burned offering or a peaceoffering freely given to the Lord the doorway looking to the east is to be made open for him and he is to make his burned offering and his peaceofferings as he does on the Sabbath day and he will go out and the door will be shut after he has gone out
Eze  And you are to give a lamb a year old without any mark on it for a burned offering to the Lord every day morning by morning you are to give it
Eze  And you are to give morning by morning a meal offering with it a sixth of an ephah and a third of a hin of oil dropped on the best meal a meal offering offered to the Lord at all times by an eternal order
Eze  And they are to give the lamb and the meal offering and the oil morning by morning for a burned offering at all times
Eze  This is what the Lord has said If the ruler gives a property to any of his sons it is his heritage and will be the property of his sons it is theirs for their heritage
Eze  And if he gives a part of his heritage to one of his servants it will be his till the year of making free and then it will go back to the ruler for it is his sons heritage and is to be theirs
Eze  And the ruler is not to take the heritage of any of the people driving them out of their property he is to give a heritage to his sons out of the property which is his so that my people may not be sent away from their property
Eze  And he took me through by the way in at the side of the doorway into the holy rooms which are the priests looking to the north and I saw a place at the side of them to the west
Eze  And he said to me This is the place where the offering for error and the sinoffering are to be cooked in water by the priests and where the meal offering is to be cooked in the oven so that they may not be taken out into the outer square to make the people holy
Eze  And he took me out into the outer square and made me go by the four angles of the square and I saw that in every angle of the open square there was a space shut in
Eze  In the four angles there were spaces walled in forty cubits long and thirty wide the four were of the same size
Eze  And there was a line of wall all round inside them round all four and boilingplaces were made under it all round about
Eze  And he said to me These are the boilingrooms where the offering of the people is cooked by the servants of the house
Eze  And he took me back to the door of the house and I saw that waters were flowing out from under the doorstep of the house on the east for the house was facing east and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house on the south side of the altar
Eze  And he took me out by the north doorway and made me go round to the outside of the doorway looking to the east and I saw waters running slowly out on the south side
Eze  And the man went out to the east with the line in his hand and after measuring a thousand cubits he made me go through the waters which came over my feet
Eze  And again measuring a thousand cubits he made me go through the waters which came up to my knees Again measuring a thousand he made me go through the waters up to the middle of my body
Eze  Again after his measuring a thousand it became a river which it was not possible to go through for the waters had become deep enough for swimming a river it was not possible to go through
Eze  And he said to me Son of man have you seen this Then he took me to the rivers edge
Eze  And he took me back and I saw at the edge of the river a very great number of trees on this side and on that
Eze  And he said to me These waters are flowing out to the east part of the land and down into the Arabah and they will go to the sea and the waters will be made sweet
Eze  And it will come about that every living and moving thing wherever their streams come will have life and there will be very much fish because these waters have come there and have been made sweet and everything wherever the river comes will have life
Eze  And fishermen will take up their places by it from Engedi as far as Eneglaim will be a place for the stretching out of nets the fish will be of every sort like the fish of the Great Sea a very great number
Eze  The wet places and the pools will not be made sweet they will be given up to salt
Eze  And by the edge of the river on this side and on that will come up every tree used for food whose leaves will ever be green and its fruit will not come to an end it will have new fruit every month because its waters come out from the holy place the fruit will be for food and the leaf will make well those who are ill
Eze  This is what the Lord has said These are the limits by which you will take up your heritage in the land among the twelve tribes of Israel Joseph is to have two parts

Eze  In whatever tribe the man from a strange land is living there you are to give him his heritage says the Lord

Eze  And the Levites are to have a part of the land equal to the limit of the priests twentyfive thousand long and ten thousand wide all of it together to be twentyfive thousand long and twenty thousand wide

Dan  In the third year of the rule of Jehoiakim king of Judah Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem shutting it in with his forces
Dan  And the Lord gave into his hands Jehoiakim king of Judah with some of the vessels of the house of God and he took them away into the land of Shinar to the house of his god and he put the vessels into the storehouse of his god
Dan  And the king gave orders to Ashpenaz the captain of his unsexed servants to take in some of the children of Israel certain of the kings family and those of high birth
Dan  Young men who were strong and healthy goodlooking and trained in all wisdom having a good education and much knowledge and able to take positions in the kings house and to have them trained in the writing and language of the Chaldaeans
Dan  And a regular amount of food and wine every day from the kings table was ordered for them by the king and they were to be cared for for three years so that at the end of that time they might take their places before the king
Dan  And among these there were of the children of Judah Daniel Hananiah Mishael and Azariah
Dan  And the captain of the unsexed servants gave them names to Daniel he gave the name of Belteshazzar to Hananiah the name of Shadrach to Mishael the name of Meshach and to Azariah the name of Abednego
Dan  And Daniel had come to the decision that he would not make himself unclean with the kings food or wine so he made a request to the captain of the unsexed servants that he might not make himself unclean
Dan  And God put into the heart of the captain of the unsexed servants kind feelings and pity for Daniel
Dan  And the captain of the unsexed servants said to Daniel I am in fear of my lord the king who has given orders about your food and your drink what if he sees you looking less happy than the other young men of your generation then you would have put my head in danger from the king
Dan  Then Daniel said to the keeper in whose care the captain of the unsexed servants had put Daniel Hananiah Mishael and Azariah
Dan  Put your servants to the test for ten days let them give us grain for our food and water for our drink
Dan  Then take a look at our faces and the faces of the young men who have food from the kings table and having seen them do to your servants as it seems right to you
Dan  So he gave ear to them in this thing and put them to the test for ten days
Dan  And at the end of ten days their faces seemed fairer and they were fatter in flesh than all the young men who had their food from the kings table
Dan  So the keeper regularly took away their meat and the wine which was to have been their drink and gave them grain
Dan  Now as for these four young men God gave them knowledge and made them expert in all booklearning and wisdom and Daniel was wise in all visions and dreams
Dan  Now at the end of the time fixed by the king for them to go in the captain of the unsexed servants took them in to Nebuchadnezzar
Dan  And the king had talk with them and among them all there was no one like Daniel Hananiah Mishael and Azariah so they were given places before the king
Dan  And in any business needing wisdom and good sense about which the king put questions to them he saw that they were ten times better than all the wonderworkers and users of secret arts in all his kingdom
Dan  And Daniel went on till the first year of King Cyrus
Dan  In the second year of the rule of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar had dreams and his spirit was troubled and his sleep went from him
Dan  Then the king gave orders that the wonderworkers and the users of secret arts and those who made use of evil powers and the Chaldaeans were to be sent for to make clear to the king his dreams So they came and took their places before the king
Dan  And the king said to them I have had a dream and my spirit is troubled by the desire to have the dream made clear to me
Dan  Then the Chaldaeans said to the king in the Aramaean language O King have life for ever give your servants an account of your dream and we will make clear to you the sense of it
Dan  The king made answer and said to the Chaldaeans This is my decision if you do not make clear to me the dream and the sense of it you will be cut in bits and your houses made waste
Dan  But if you make clear the dream and the sense of it you will have from me offerings and rewards and great honour so make clear to me the dream and the sense of it
Dan  A second time they said in answer Let the king give his servants an account of his dream and we will make clear the sense
Dan  The king made answer and said I am certain that you are attempting to get more time because you see that my decision is fixed
Dan  That if you do not make my dream clear to me there is only one fate for you for you have made ready false and evil words to say before me till the times are changed so give me an account of the dream and I will be certain that you are able to make the sense of it clear
Dan  Then the Chaldaeans said to the king in answer There is not a man on earth able to make clear the kings business for no king however great his power has ever made such a request to any wonderworker or user of secret arts or Chaldaean
Dan  The kings request is a very hard one and there is no other who is able to make it clear to the king but the gods whose livingplace is not with flesh
Dan  Because of this the king was angry and full of wrath and gave orders for the destruction of all the wise men of Babylon
Dan  So the order went out that the wise men were to be put to death and they were looking for Daniel and his friends to put them to death
Dan  Then Daniel gave an answer with wisdom and good sense to Arioch the captain of the kings armed men who had gone out to put to death the wise men of Babylon
Dan  He made answer and said to Arioch O captain of the king why is the kings order so cruel Then Arioch gave Daniel an account of the business
Dan  And Daniel went in and made a request to the king to give him time and he would make clear the sense of his dream to the king
Dan  And Daniel went to his house and gave his friends Hananiah Mishael and Azariah the news
Dan  So that they might make a request for the mercy of the God of heaven in the question of this secret so that Daniel and his friends might not come to destruction with the rest of the wise men of Babylon
Dan  Then the secret was made clear to Daniel in a vision of the night And Daniel gave blessing to the God of heaven
Dan  And Daniel said in answer May the name of God be praised for ever and ever for wisdom and strength are his
Dan  By him times and years are changed by him kings are taken away and kings are lifted up he gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those whose minds are awake
Dan  He is the unveiler of deep and secret things he has knowledge of what is in the dark and the light has its livingplace with him
Dan  I give you praise and worship O God of my fathers who have given me wisdom and strength and have now made clear to me what we were requesting from you for you have given us knowledge of the kings business
Dan  For this reason Daniel went to Arioch to whom the king had given orders for the destruction of the wise men of Babylon and said to him Do not put to death the wise men of Babylon take me in before the king and I will make clear to him the sense of the dream
Dan  Then Arioch quickly took Daniel in before the king and said to him Here is a man from among the prisoners of Judah who will make clear to the king the sense of the dream
Dan  The king made answer and said to Daniel whose name was Belteshazzar Are you able to make clear to me the dream which I saw and its sense
Dan  Then Daniel said in answer to the king No wise men or users of secret arts or wonderworkers or readers of signs are able to make clear to the king the secret he is searching for
Dan  But there is a God in heaven the unveiler of secrets and he has given to King Nebuchadnezzar knowledge of what will take place in the last days Your dreams and the visions of your head on your bed are these
Dan  As for you O King the thoughts which came to you on your bed were of what will come about after this and the unveiler of secrets has made clear to you what is to come
Dan  As for me this secret is not made clear to me because of any wisdom which I have more than any living man but in order that the sense of the dream may be made clear to the king and that you may have knowledge of the thoughts of your heart
Dan  You O King were looking and a great image was there This image which was very great and whose glory was very bright was placed before you its form sent fear into the heart
Dan  As for this image its head was made of the best gold its breast and its arms were of silver its middle and its sides were of brass
Dan  Its legs of iron its feet were in part of iron and in part of potters earth
Dan  While you were looking at it a stone was cut out but not by hands and it gave the image a blow on its feet which were of iron and earth and they were broken in bits
Dan  Then the iron and the earth the brass and the silver and the gold were smashed together and became like the dust on the floors where grain is crushed in summer and the wind took them away so that no sign of them was to be seen and the stone which gave the image a blow became a great mountain covering all the earth
Dan  This is the dream and we will make clear to the king the sense of it
Dan  You O King king of kings to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom the power and the strength and the glory
Dan  Wherever the children of men are living into whose hands he has given the beasts of the field and the birds of heaven and has made you ruler over them all you are the head of gold
Dan  And after you another kingdom lower than you will come to power and a third kingdom of brass ruling over all the earth
Dan  And the fourth kingdom will be strong as iron because as all things are broken and overcome by iron so it will have the power of crushing and smashing down all the earth
Dan  And as you saw the feet and toes part of potters work and part of iron there will be a division in the kingdom but there will be some of the strength of iron in it because you saw the iron mixed with the potters earth
Dan  And as the toes of the feet were in part of iron and in part of earth so part of the kingdom will be strong and part of it will readily be broken
Dan  And as you saw the iron mixed with earth they will give their daughters to one another as wives but they will not be united one with another even as iron is not mixed with earth
Dan  And in the days of those kings the God of heaven will put up a kingdom which will never come to destruction and its power will never be given into the hands of another people and all these kingdoms will be broken and overcome by it but it will keep its place for ever
Dan  Because you saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that by it the iron and the brass and the earth and the silver and the gold were broken to bits a great God has given the king knowledge of what is to take place in the future the dream is fixed and its sense is certain
Dan  Then King Nebuchadnezzar falling down on his face gave worship to Daniel and gave orders for an offering and spices to be given to him
Dan  And the king made answer to Daniel and said Truly your God is a God of gods and a Lord of kings and an unveiler of secrets for you have been able to make this secret clear
Dan  Then the king made Daniel great and gave him offerings in great number and made him ruler over all the land of Babylon and chief over all the wise men of Babylon
Dan  And at Daniels request the king gave Shadrach Meshach and Abednego authority over the business of the land of Babylon but Daniel was kept near the kings person
Dan  Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold sixty cubits high and six cubits wide he put it up in the valley of Dura in the land of Babylon
Dan  And Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to get together all the captains the chiefs the rulers the wise men the keepers of public money the judges the overseers and all the rulers of the divisions of the country to come to see the unveiling of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had put up
Dan  Then the captains the chiefs the rulers the wise men the keepers of public money the judges the overseers and all the rulers of the divisions of the country came together to see the unveiling of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had put up and they took their places before the image which Nebuchadnezzar had put up
Dan  Then one of the kings criers said in a loud voice To you the order is given O peoples nations and languages
Dan  That when the sound of the horn pipe harp trigon psaltery bagpipe and all sorts of instruments comes to your ears you are to go down on your faces in worship before the image of gold which Nebuchadnezzar the king has put up
Dan  And anyone not falling down and worshipping will that same hour be put into a burning and flaming fire
Dan  So at that time all the people when the sound of the horn pipe harp trigon psaltery and all sorts of instruments came to their ears went down on their faces in worship before the image of gold which Nebuchadnezzar the king had put up
Dan  At that time certain Chaldaeans came near and made a statement against the Jews
Dan  They made answer and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king O King have life for ever
Dan  You O King have given an order that every man when the sound of the horn pipe harp trigon psaltery bagpipe and all sorts of instruments comes to his ears is to go down on his face in worship before the image of gold
Dan  And anyone not falling down and worshipping is to be put into a burning and flaming fire
Dan  There are certain Jews whom you have put over the business of the land of Babylon Shadrach Meshach and Abednego these men have not given attention to you O King they are not servants of your gods or worshippers of the gold image which you have put up
Dan  Then Nebuchadnezzar in his wrath and passion gave orders for Shadrach Meshach and Abednego to be sent for Then they made these men come in before the king
Dan  Nebuchadnezzar made answer and said to them Is it true O Shadrach Meshach and Abednego that you will not be servants of my god or give worship to the image of gold which I have put up
Dan  Now if you are ready on hearing the sound of the horn pipe harp trigon psaltery bagpipe and all sorts of instruments to go down on your faces in worship before the image which I have made it is well but if you will not give worship that same hour you will be put into a burning and flaming fire and what god is there who will be able to take you out of my hands
Dan  Shadrach Meshach and Abednego answering Nebuchadnezzar the king said There is no need for us to give you an answer to this question
Dan  If our God whose servants we are is able to keep us safe from the burning and flaming fire and from your hands O King he will keep us safe
Dan  But if not be certain O King that we will not be the servants of your gods or give worship to the image of gold which you have put up
Dan  Then Nebuchadnezzar was full of wrath and the form of his face was changed against Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and he gave orders that the fire was to be heated up seven times more than it was generally heated
Dan  And he gave orders to certain strong men in his army to put cords on Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and put them into the burning and flaming fire
Dan  Then these men had cords put round them as they were in their coats their trousers their hats and their clothing and were dropped into the burning and flaming fire
Dan  And because the kings order was not to be put on one side and the heat of the fire was so great the men who took up Shadrach Meshach and Abednego were burned to death by the flame of the fire
Dan  And these three men Shadrach Meshach and Abednego with the cords about them went down into the burning and flaming fire
Dan  Then King Nebuchadnezzar full of fear and wonder got up quickly and said to his wise men Did we not put three men in cords into the fire and they made answer and said to the king True O King
Dan  He made answer and said Look I see four men loose walking in the middle of the fire and they are not damaged and the form of the fourth is like a son of the gods
Dan  Then Nebuchadnezzar came near the door of the burning and flaming fire he made answer and said Shadrach Meshach and Abednego you servants of the Most High God come out and come here Then Shadrach Meshach and Abednego came out of the fire
Dan  And the captains the chiefs and the rulers and the kings wise men who had come together saw these men over whose bodies the fire had no power and not a hair of their heads was burned and their coats were not changed and there was no smell of fire about them
Dan  Nebuchadnezzar made answer and said Praise be to the God of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego who has sent his angel and kept his servants safe who had faith in him and who put the kings word on one side and gave up their bodies to the fire so that they might not be servants or worshippers of any other god but their God
Dan  And it is my decision that any people nation or language saying evil against the God of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego will be cut to bits and their houses made waste because there is no other god who is able to give salvation such as this
Dan  Then the king gave Shadrach Meshach and Abednego even greater authority in the land of Babylon
Dan  Nebuchadnezzar the king to all the peoples nations and languages living in all the earth May your peace be increased
Dan  It has seemed good to me to make clear the signs and wonders which the Most High God has done with me
Dan  How great are his signs and how full of power are his wonders his kingdom is an eternal kingdom and his rule goes on from generation to generation
Dan  I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in my place and all things were going well for me in my great house
Dan  I saw a dream which was a cause of great fear to me I was troubled by the images of my mind on my bed and by the visions of my head
Dan  And I gave orders for all the wise men of Babylon to come in before me so that they might make clear to me the sense of my dream
Dan  Then the wonderworkers the users of secret arts the Chaldaeans and the readers of signs came in to me and I put the dream before them but they did not make clear the sense of it to me
Dan  But at last Daniel came in before me he whose name was Belteshazzar after the name of my god and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods and I put the dream before him saying
Dan  O Belteshazzar master of the wonderworkers because I am certain that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and you are troubled by no secret this is the dream which I saw make clear to me its sense
Dan  On my bed I saw a vision there was a tree in the middle of the earth and it was very high
Dan  And the tree became tall and strong stretching up to heaven and to be seen from the ends of the earth
Dan  Its leaves were fair and it had much fruit and in it was food enough for all the beasts of the field had shade under it and the birds of heaven were resting in its branches and it gave food to all living things
Dan  In the visions of my head on my bed I saw a watcher a holy one coming down from heaven
Dan  Crying out with a loud voice and this is what he said Let the tree be cut down and its branches broken off let its leaves be taken off and its fruit sent in every direction let the beasts get away from under it and the birds from its branches
Dan  But keep its broken end and its roots still in the earth even with a band of iron and brass let him have the young grass of the field for food and let him be wet with the dew of heaven and let his part be with the beasts
Dan  Let his heart be changed from that of a man and the heart of a beast be given to him and let seven times go by him
Dan  This order is fixed by the watchers and the decision is by the word of the holy ones so that the living may be certain that the Most High is ruler over the kingdom of men and gives it to any man at his pleasure lifting up over it the lowest of men
Dan  This dream I King Nebuchadnezzar saw and do you O Belteshazzar make clear the sense of it for all the wise men of my kingdom are unable to make the sense of it clear to me but you are able for the spirit of the holy gods is in you
Dan  Then Daniel whose name was Belteshazzar was at a loss for a time his thoughts troubling him The king made answer and said Belteshazzar do not be troubled by the dream or by the sense of it Belteshazzar answering said My lord may the dream be about your haters and its sense about those who are against you
Dan  The tree which you saw which became tall and strong stretching up to heaven and seen from the ends of the earth
Dan  Which had fair leaves and much fruit and had in it food for all under which the beasts of the field were living and in the branches of which the birds of heaven had their restingplaces
Dan  It is you O King who have become great and strong for your power is increased and stretching up to heaven and your rule to the end of the earth
Dan  And as for the vision which the king saw of a watcher a holy one coming down from heaven saying Let the tree be cut down and given to destruction
Dan  This is the sense of it O King and it is the decision of the Most High which has come on my lord the king
Dan  That they will send you out from among men to be with the beasts of the field they will give you grass for your food like the oxen and you will be wet with the dew of heaven and seven times will go by you till you are certain that the Most High is ruler in the kingdom of men and gives it to any man at his pleasure
Dan  And as they gave orders to let the broken end and the roots of the tree be so your kingdom will be safe for you after it is clear to you that the heavens are ruling
Dan  For this cause O King let my suggestion be pleasing to you and let your sins be covered by righteousness and your evildoing by mercy to the poor so that the time of your wellbeing may be longer
Dan  All this came to King Nebuchadnezzar
Dan  At the end of twelve months he was walking on the roof of his great house in Babylon
Dan  The king made answer and said Is this not great Babylon which I have made for the livingplace of kings by the strength of my power and for the glory of my honour
Dan  While the word was still in the kings mouth a voice came down from heaven saying O King Nebuchadnezzar to you it is said The kingdom has gone from you
Dan  And they will send you out from among men to be with the beasts of the field they will give you grass for your food like the oxen and seven times will go by you till you are certain that the Most High is ruler in the kingdom of men and gives it to any man at his pleasure
Dan  That very hour the order about Nebuchadnezzar was put into effect and he was sent out from among men and had grass for his food like the oxen and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hair became long as eagles feathers and his nails like those of birds
Dan  And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifting up my eyes to heaven got back my reason and blessing the Most High I gave praise and honour to him who is living for ever whose rule is an eternal rule and whose kingdom goes on from generation to generation
Dan  And all the people of the earth are as nothing he does his pleasure in the army of heaven and among the people of the earth and no one is able to keep back his hand or say to him What are you doing
Dan  At the same time my reason came back to me and for the glory of my kingdom my honour and my great name came back to me and my wise men and my lords were turned to me again and I was made safe in my kingdom and had more power than before
Dan  Now I Nebuchadnezzar give worship and praise and honour to the King of heaven for all his works are true and his ways are right and those who go in pride he is able to make low
Dan  Belshazzar the king made a great feast for a thousand of his lords drinking wine before the thousand
Dan  Belshazzar while he was overcome with wine gave orders for them to put before him the gold and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken from the Temple in Jerusalem so that the king and his lords his wives and his other women might take their drink from them
Dan  Then they took in the gold and silver vessels which had been in the Temple of the house of God at Jerusalem and the king and his lords his wives and his other women took wine from them
Dan  They took their wine and gave praise to the gods of gold and silver of brass and iron and wood and stone
Dan  In that very hour the fingers of a mans hand were seen writing opposite the support for the light on the white wall of the kings house and the king saw the part of the hand which was writing
Dan  Then the colour went from the kings face and he was troubled by his thoughts strength went from his body and his knees were shaking
Dan  The king crying out with a loud voice said that the users of secret arts the Chaldaeans and the readers of signs were to be sent for The king made answer and said to the wise men of Babylon Whoever is able to make out this writing and make clear to me the sense of it will be clothed in purple and have a chain of gold round his neck and will be a ruler of high authority in the kingdom
Dan  Then all the kings wise men came in but they were not able to make out the writing or give the sense of it to the king
Dan  Then King Belshazzar was greatly troubled and the colour went from his face and his lords were at a loss
Dan  The queen because of the words of the king and his lords came into the house of the feast the queen made answer and said O King have life for ever do not be troubled by your thoughts or let the colour go from your face
Dan  There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods and in the days of your father light and reason like the wisdom of the gods were seen in him and King Nebuchadnezzar your father made him master of the wonderworkers and the users of secret arts and the Chaldaeans and the readers of signs
Dan  Because a most special spirit and knowledge and reason and the power of reading dreams and unfolding dark sayings and answering hard questions were seen to be in him even in Daniel named Belteshazzar by the king now let Daniel be sent for and he will make clear the sense of the writing
Dan  Then they took Daniel in before the king the king made answer and said to Daniel So you are that Daniel of the prisoners of Judah whom my father took out of Judah
Dan  And I have had news of you that the spirit of the gods is in you and that light and reason and special wisdom have been seen in you
Dan  And now the wise men the users of secret arts have been sent in before me for the purpose of reading this writing and making clear to me the sense of it but they are not able to make clear the sense of the thing
Dan  And I have had news of you that you have the power of making things clear and of answering hard questions now if you are able to make out the writing and give me the sense of it you will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain round your neck and be a ruler of high authority in the kingdom
Dan  Then Daniel made answer and said to the king Keep your offerings for yourself and give your rewards to another but I after reading the writing to the king will give him the sense of it
Dan  As for you O King the Most High God gave to Nebuchadnezzar your father the kingdom and great power and glory and honour
Dan  And because of the great power he gave him all peoples and nations and languages were shaking in fear before him some he put to death and others he kept living at his pleasure lifting up some and putting others down as it pleased him
Dan  But when his heart was lifted up and his spirit became hard with pride he was put down from his place as king and they took his glory from him
Dan  And he was sent out from among the sons of men and his heart was made like the beasts and he was living with the asses of the fields he had grass for his food like the oxen and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till he was certain that the Most High is ruler in the kingdom of men and gives power over it to anyone at his pleasure
Dan  And you his son O Belshazzar have not kept your heart free from pride though you had knowledge of all this
Dan  But you have been lifting yourself up against the Lord of heaven and they have put the vessels of his house before you and you and your lords your wives and your women have taken wine in them and you have given praise to gods of silver and gold of brass and iron and wood and stone who are without the power of seeing or hearing and without knowledge and to the God in whose hand your breath is and whose are all your ways you have not given glory
Dan  Then the part of the hand was sent out from before him and this writing was recorded
Dan  And this is the writing which was recorded Mene tekel peres
Dan  This is the sense of the words Mene your kingdom has been numbered by God and ended
Dan  Tekel you have been put in the scales and seen to be under weight
Dan  Peres your kingdom has been cut up and given to the Medes and Persians
Dan  Then by the order of Belshazzar they put a purple robe on Daniel and a gold chain round his neck and a public statement was made that he was to be a ruler of high authority in the kingdom
Dan  That very night Belshazzar the king of the Chaldaeans was put to death
Dan  And Darius the Mede took the kingdom being then about sixtytwo years old
Dan  Darius was pleased to put over the kingdom a hundred and twenty captains who were to be all through the kingdom
Dan  And over them were three chief rulers of whom Daniel was one and the captains were to be responsible to the chief rulers so that the king might undergo no loss
Dan  Then this Daniel did his work better than the chief rulers and the captains because there was a special spirit in him and it was the kings purpose to put him over all the kingdom
Dan  Then the chief rulers and the captains were looking for some cause for putting Daniel in the wrong in connection with the kingdom but they were unable to put forward any wrongdoing or error against him because he was true and no error or wrong was to be seen in him
Dan  Then these men said We will only get a reason for attacking Daniel in connection with the law of his God
Dan  Then these chief rulers and the captains came to the king and said to him O King Darius have life for ever
Dan  All the chief rulers of the kingdom the chiefs and the captains the wise men and the rulers have made a common decision to put in force a law having the kings authority and to give a strong order that whoever makes any request to any god or man but you O King for thirty days is to be put into the lions hole
Dan  Now O King put the order in force signing the writing so that it may not be changed like the law of the Medes and Persians which may not come to an end
Dan  For this reason King Darius put his name on the writing and the order
Dan  And Daniel on hearing that the writing had been signed went into his house now he had windows in his room on the roof opening in the direction of Jerusalem and three times a day he went down on his knees in prayer and praise before his God as he had done before
Dan  Then these men were watching and saw Daniel making prayers and requesting grace before his God
Dan  Then they came near before the king and said O King have you not put your name to an order that any man who makes a request to any god or man but you O King for thirty days is to be put into the lions hole The king made answer and said The thing is fixed by the law of the Medes and Persians which may not come to an end
Dan  Then they made answer and said before the king Daniel one of the prisoners of Judah has no respect for you O King or for the order signed by you but three times a day he makes his prayer to God
Dan  When this thing came to the kings ears it was very evil to him and his heart was fixed on keeping Daniel safe and till the going down of the sun he was doing everything in his power to get him free
Dan  Then these men said to the king Be certain O King that by the law of the Medes and Persians no order or law which the king has put into force may be changed
Dan  Then the king gave the order and they took Daniel and put him into the lions hole The king made answer and said to Daniel Your God whose servant you are at all times will keep you safe
Dan  Then they got a stone and put it over the mouth of the hole and it was stamped with the kings stamp and with the stamp of the lords so that the decision about Daniel might not be changed
Dan  Then the king went to his great house and took no food that night and no  were placed before him and his sleep went from him
Dan  Then very early in the morning the king got up and went quickly to the lions hole
Dan  And when he came near the hole where Daniel was he gave a loud cry of grief the king made answer and said to Daniel O Daniel servant of the living God is your God whose servant you are at all times able to keep you safe from the lions
Dan  Then Daniel said to the king O King have life for ever
Dan  My God has sent his angel to keep the lions mouths shut and they have done me no damage because I was seen to be without sin before him and further before you O King I have done no wrong
Dan  Then the king was very glad and gave orders for them to take Daniel up out of the hole So Daniel was taken up out of the hole and he was seen to be untouched because he had faith in his God
Dan  And at the kings order they took those men who had said evil against Daniel and put them in the lions hole with their wives and their children and they had not got to the floor of the hole before the lions overcame them and all their bones were broken
Dan  Then King Darius sent a letter to all the peoples nations and languages living in all the earth May your peace be increased
Dan  It is my order that in all the kingdom of which I am ruler men are to be shaking with fear before the God of Daniel for he is the living God unchanging for ever and his kingdom is one which will never come to destruction his rule will go on to the end
Dan  He gives salvation and makes men free from danger and does signs and wonders in heaven and earth who has kept Daniel safe from the power of the lions
Dan  So this Daniel did well in the kingdom of Darius and in the kingdom of Cyrus the Persian
Dan  In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel saw a dream and visions came into his head on his bed then he put the dream in writing
Dan  I had a vision by night and saw the four winds of heaven violently moving the great sea
Dan  And four great beasts came up from the sea different one from another
Dan  The first was like a lion and had eagles wings while I was watching its wings were pulled off and it was lifted up from the earth and placed on two feet like a man and a mans heart was given to it
Dan  And I saw another beast like a bear and it was lifted up on one side and three sidebones were in its mouth between its teeth and they said to it Up take much flesh
Dan  After this I saw another beast like a leopard which had on its back four wings like those of a bird and the beast had four heads and the power of a ruler was given to it
Dan  After this in my vision of the night I saw a fourth beast a thing causing fear and very troubling full of power and very strong and it had great iron teeth it took its food crushing some of it to bits and stamping down the rest with its feet it was different from all the beasts before it and it had ten horns
Dan  I was watching the horns with care and I saw another coming up among them a little one before which three of the first horns were pulled up by the roots and there were eyes like a mans eyes in this horn and a mouth saying great things
Dan  I went on looking till the seats of kings were placed and one like a very old man took his seat his clothing was white as snow and the hair of his head was like clean wool his seat was flames of fire and its wheels burning fire
Dan  A stream of fire was flowing and coming out from before him a thousand thousands were his servants and ten thousand times ten thousand were in their places before him the judge was seated and the books were open
Dan  Then I sawbecause of the voice of the great words which the horn saidI saw till the beast was put to death and its body was given to destruction and the beast was given to the burning of fire
Dan  As for the rest of the beasts their authority was taken away but they let them go on living for a measure of time
Dan  I saw in visions of the night and there was coming with the clouds of heaven one like a man and he came to the one who was very old and they took him near before him
Dan  And to him was given authority and glory and a kingdom and all peoples nations and languages were his servants his authority is an eternal authority which will not come to an end and his kingdom is one which will not come to destruction
Dan  As for me Daniel my spirit was pained because of this and the visions of my head were troubling me
Dan  I came near to one of those who were waiting there questioning him about what all this was And he said to me that he would make clear to me the sense of these things
Dan  These great beasts are four kings who will be cut off from the earth
Dan  But the saints of the Most High will take the kingdom and it will be theirs for ever even for ever and ever
Dan  Then it was my desire to have certain knowledge about the fourth beast which was different from all the others a cause of great fear whose teeth were of iron and his nails of brass who took his food crushing some of it to bits and stamping on the rest with his feet
Dan  And about the ten horns on his head and the other which came up causing the fall of three that horn which had eyes and a mouth saying great things which seemed to be greater than the other horns
Dan  And I saw how that horn made war on the saints and overcame them
Dan  Till he came who was very old and the decision was made and the authority was given to the saints of the Most High and the time came when the saints took the kingdom
Dan  This is what he said The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom which will come on earth different from all the kingdoms and it will overcome all the earth crushing it down and smashing it
Dan  And as for the ten horns out of this kingdom ten kings will come to power and after them another will come up he will be different from the first ones and will put down three kings
Dan  And he will say words against the Most High attempting to put an end to the saints of the Most High and he will have the idea of changing times and law and the saints will be given into his hands for a time and times and half a time
Dan  But the judge will be seated and they will put an end to his authority to overcome it and send complete destruction on it
Dan  And the kingdom and the authority and the power of the kingdoms under all the heaven will be given to the people of the saints of the Most High his kingdom is an eternal kingdom and all powers will be his servants and do his pleasure
Dan  Here is the end of the account As for me Daniel I was greatly troubled by my thoughts and the colour went from my face but I kept the thing in my heart
Dan  In the third year of the rule of Belshazzar the king a vision was seen by me Daniel after the one I saw at first
Dan  And I saw in the vision and when I saw it I was in the strong town Shushan which is in the country of Elam and in the vision I was by the waterdoor of the Ulai
Dan  And lifting up my eyes I saw there before the stream a male sheep with two horns and the two horns were high but one was higher than the other the higher one coming up last
Dan  I saw the sheep pushing to the west and to the north and to the south and no beasts were able to keep their place before him and no one was able to get people out of his power but he did whatever his pleasure was and made himself great
Dan  And while I was giving thought to this I saw a hegoat coming from the west over the face of all the earth without touching the earth and the hegoat had a great horn between his eyes
Dan  And he came to the twohorned sheep which I saw before the stream rushing at him in the heat of his power
Dan  And I saw him come right up to the sheep and he was moved with wrath against him attacking the sheep so that his two horns were broken and the sheep had not strength to keep his place before him but was pushed down on the earth and crushed under his feet and there was no one to get the sheep out of his power
Dan  And the hegoat became very great and when he was strong the great horn was broken and in its place came up four other horns turned to the four winds of heaven
Dan  And out of one of them came another horn a little one which became very great stretching to the south and to the east and to the beautiful land
Dan  And it became great even as high as the army of heaven pulling down some of the army even of the stars to the earth and crushing them under its feet
Dan  It made itself great even as great as the lord of the army and by it the regular burned offering was taken away and the place overturned and the holy place made waste
Dan   against the regular burned offering and  crushed down to the earth and it did its pleasure and things went well for it
Dan  Then there came to my ears the voice of a holy one talking and another holy one said to that certain one who was talking How long will the vision be while the regular burned offering is taken away and the unclean thing causing fear is put up and the holy place crushed under foot
Dan  And he said to him For two thousand three hundred evenings and mornings then the holy place will be made clean
Dan  And it came about that when I Daniel had seen this vision I had a desire for the sense of it to be unfolded and I saw one before me in the form of a man
Dan  And the voice of a man came to my ears between the sides of the Ulai crying out and saying Gabriel make the vision clear to this man
Dan  So he came and took his place near where I was and when he came I was full of fear and went down on my face but he said to me Let it be clear to you O son of man for the vision has to do with the time of the end
Dan  Now while he was talking to me I went into a deep sleep with my face to the earth but touching me he put me on my feet where I had been
Dan  And he said See I will make clear to you what is to come in the later time of the wrath for it has to do with the fixed time of the end
Dan  The sheep which you saw with two horns they are the kings of Media and Persia
Dan  And the hegoat is the king of Greece and the great horn between his eyes is the first king
Dan  And as for that which was broken in place of which four came up four kingdoms will come up from his nation but not with his power
Dan  And in the later years of their kingdom when their evil doings have become complete there will come up a king full of pride and expert in dark sayings
Dan  And his power will be great and he will be purposing strange things And all will go well for him and he will do his pleasure and he will send destruction on the strong ones
Dan  And his designs will be turned against the holy people causing deceit to do well in his hand in his heart he will make himself great and send destruction on numbers who are living unconscious of their danger and he will put himself up against the prince of princes but he will be broken though not by mens hands
Dan  And the vision of evenings and mornings which has been talked of is true and keep the vision secret for it has to do with the faroff future
Dan  And I Daniel was ill for some days then I got up and did the kings business and I was full of wonder at the vision but no one was able to give the sense of it
Dan  In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus of the seed of the Medes who was made king over the kingdom of the Chaldaeans
Dan  In the first year of his rule I Daniel saw clearly from the books the number of years given by the word of the Lord to the prophet Jeremiah in which the making waste of Jerusalem was to be complete that is seventy years
Dan  And turning my face to the Lord God I gave myself up to prayer requesting his grace going without food in haircloth and dust
Dan  And I made prayer to the Lord my God putting our sins before him and said O Lord the great God greatly to be feared keeping your agreement and mercy with those who have love for you and do your orders
Dan  We are sinners acting wrongly and doing evil we have gone against you turning away from your orders and from your laws
Dan  We have not given ear to your servants the prophets who said words in your name to our kings and our rulers and our fathers and all the people of the land
Dan  O Lord righteousness is yours but shame is on us even to this day and on the men of Judah and the people of Jerusalem and on all Israel those who are near and those who are far off in all the countries where you have sent them because of the sin which they have done against you
Dan  O Lord shame is on us on our kings and our rulers and our fathers because of our sin against you
Dan  With the Lord our God are mercies and forgiveness for we have gone against him
Dan  And have not given ear to the voice of the Lord our God to go in the way of his laws which he put before us by the mouth of his servants the prophets
Dan  And all Israel have been sinners against your law turning away so as not to give ear to your voice and the curse has been let loose on us and the oath recorded in the law of Moses the servant of God for we have done evil against him
Dan  And he has given effect to his words which he said against us and against those who were our judges by sending a great evil on us for under all heaven there has not been done what has been done to Jerusalem
Dan  As it was recorded in the law of Moses all this evil has come on us but we have made no prayer for grace from the Lord our God that we might be turned from our evil doings and come to true wisdom
Dan  So the Lord has been watching over this evil and has made it come on us for the Lord our God is upright in all his acts which he has done and we have not given ear to his voice
Dan  And now O Lord our God who took your people out of the land of Egypt with a strong hand and made a great name for yourself even to this day we are sinners we have done evil
Dan  O Lord because of your righteousness let your wrath and your passion be turned away from your town Jerusalem your holy mountain because through our sins and the evildoing of our fathers Jerusalem and your people have become a cause of shame to all who are round about us
Dan  And now give ear O our God to the prayer of your servant and to his request for grace and let your face be shining on your holy place which is made waste because of your servants O Lord
Dan  O my God let your ear be turned and give hearing let your eyes be open and see how we have been made waste and the town which is named by your name for we are not offering our prayers before you because of our righteousness but because of your great mercies
Dan  O Lord give ear O Lord have forgiveness O Lord take note and do let there be no more waiting for the honour of your name O my God because your town and your people are named by your name
Dan  And while I was still saying these words in prayer and putting my sins and the sins of my people Israel before the Lord and requesting grace from the Lord my God for the holy mountain of my God
Dan  Even while I was still in prayer the man Gabriel whom I had seen in the vision at first when my weariness was great put his hand on me about the time of the evening offering
Dan  And teaching me and talking to me he said O Daniel I have come now to give you wisdom
Dan  At the first word of your prayer a word went out and I have come to give you knowledge for you are a man dearly loved so give thought to the word and let the vision be clear to you
Dan  Seventy weeks have been fixed for your people and your holy town to let wrongdoing be complete and sin come to its full limit and for the clearing away of evildoing and the coming in of eternal righteousness so that the vision and the word of the prophet may be stamped as true and to put the holy oil on a most holy place
Dan  Have then the certain knowledge that from the going out of the word for the building again of Jerusalem till the coming of a prince on whom the holy oil has been put will be seven weeks in sixtytwo weeks its building will be complete with square and earthwork
Dan  And at the end of the times even after the sixtytwo weeks one on whom the holy oil has been put will be cut off and have no  and the town and the holy place will be made waste together with a prince and the end will come with an overflowing of waters and even to the end there will be war the making waste which has been fixed
Dan  And a strong order will be sent out against the great number for one week and so for half of the week the offering and the meal offering will come to an end and in its place will be an unclean thing causing fear till the destruction which has been fixed is let loose on him who has made waste
Dan  In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a secret was unfolded to Daniel whose name was Belteshazzar and the thing was true even a hard work and he had knowledge of it and the vision was clear to him
Dan  In those days I Daniel gave myself up to grief for three full weeks
Dan  I had no pleasing food no meat or wine came into my mouth and I put no oil on my body till three full weeks were ended
Dan  And on the twentyfourth day of the first month I was by the side of the great river
Dan  And lifting up my eyes I saw the form of a man clothed in a linen robe and round him there was a band of gold of the best gold
Dan  And his body was like the beryl and his face had the look of a thunderflame and his eyes were like burning lights and his arms and feet like the colour of polished brass and the sound of his voice was like the sound of an army
Dan  And I Daniel was the only one who saw the vision for the men who were with me did not see it but a great shaking came on them and they went in flight to take cover
Dan  So I was by myself and I saw this great vision and all my strength went from me and the colour went from my face
Dan  But the sound of his words came to my ears and on hearing his voice I went into a deep sleep with my face to the earth
Dan  Then a hand gave me a touch awaking me and putting me on my knees and my hands
Dan  And he said to me O Daniel you man dearly loved take in the sense of the words I say to you and get up on to your feet for to you I am now sent and when he had said this to me I got on to my feet shaking with fear
Dan  Then he said to me Have no fear Daniel for from the first day when you gave your heart to getting wisdom and making yourself poor in spirit before your God your words have come to his ears and I have come because of your words
Dan  But the angel of the kingdom of Persia put himself against me for twentyone days but Michael one of the chief angels came to my help and when I came he was still there with the angel of the kings of Persia
Dan  Now I have come to give you knowledge of the fate of your people in the later days for there is still a vision for the days
Dan  And after he had said these words to me I kept my face turned to the earth and was unable to say anything
Dan  Then one whose form was like the sons of men put his finger on my lips and opening my mouth I said to him who was before me O my lord because of the vision my pains have come on me and I have no more strength
Dan  For how may this servant of my lord have talk with my lord for as for me straight away my strength went from me and there was no breath in my body
Dan  Then again one having the form of a man put his hand on me and gave me strength
Dan  And he said to me O man greatly loved have no fear peace be with you be strong and let your heart be lifted up And at his words I became strong and said Let my lord say on for you have given me strength
Dan  Then he said It is clear to you why I have come to you And now I will give you an account of what is recorded in the true writings
Dan  But I am going back to make war with the angel of Persia and when I am gone the angel of Greece will come And there is no one on my side against these but Michael your angel
Dan  And as for me in the first year of Darius the Mede I was on his side to make his position safe and make him strong
Dan  And now I will make clear to you what is true There are still three kings to come in Persia and the fourth will have much greater wealth than all of them and when he has become strong through his wealth he will put his forces in motion against all the kingdoms of Greece
Dan  And a strong king will come to power ruling with great authority and doing whatever is his pleasure
Dan  And when he has become strong his kingdom will be broken and parted to the four winds of heaven but not to his offspring for it will be uprooted and his kingdom will be for the others and not for these but not with the same authority as his
Dan  And the king of the south will be strong but one of his captains will be stronger than he and will be ruler and his rule will be a great rule
Dan  And at the end of years they will be joined together and the daughter of the king of the south will come to the king of the north to make an agreement but she will not keep the strength of her arm and his offspring will not keep their place but she will be uprooted with those who were the cause of her coming and her son and he who took her in those times
Dan  But out of a branch from her roots one will come up to take his place who will come against the army forcing his way into the strong place of the king of the north and he will take them in hand and overcome them
Dan  And their gods and their metal images and their fair vessels of silver and gold he will take away into the south and for some years he will keep away from the king of the north
Dan  And he will come into the kingdom of the king of the south but he will go back to his land
Dan  And his son will make war and will get together an army of great forces and he will make an attack on him overflowing and going past and he will again take the war even to his strong place
Dan  And the king of the south will be moved with wrath and will come out and make war on him on this same king of the north and he will get together a great army but the army will be given into his hand
Dan  And the army will be taken away and his heart will be uplifted he will be the cause of the downfall of tens of thousands but he will not be strong
Dan  And again the king of the north will get together an army greater than the first and he will make an attack on him at the end of years with a great army and much wealth
Dan  In those times a number will take up arms against the king of the south and the children of the violent among your people will be lifting themselves up to make the vision come true but it will be their downfall
Dan  So the king of the north will come and put up earthworks and take a wellarmed town and the forces of the king of the south will make an attempt to keep their position even the best of his army but they will not have strength to do so
Dan  And he who comes against him will do his pleasure and no one will be able to keep his place before him he will take up his position in the beautiful land and in his hand there will be destruction
Dan  And it will be his purpose to come with the strength of all his kingdom but in place of this he will make an agreement with him and he will give him the daughter of women to send destruction on it but this will not take place or come about
Dan  After this his face will be turned to the islands and he will take a number of them but a chief by his destruction will put an end to the shame offered by him and more than this he will make his shame come back on him
Dan  Then his face will be turned to the strong places of his land but his way will be stopped causing his downfall and he will not be seen again
Dan  Then his place will be taken by one who will send out a man with the glory of a king to get wealth together but after a short time destruction will overtake him but not in wrath or in the fight
Dan  And his place will be taken by a low person to whom the honour of the kingdom had not been given but he will come in time of peace and will get the kingdom by fair words
Dan  And his forces will be completely taken away from before him and broken and even the ruler of the agreement will have the same fate
Dan  And from the time when they make an agreement with him he will be working falsely for he will take up arms suddenly with a small force
Dan  Against fertile places and will make waste a part of the country and he will do what his fathers have not done or his fathers fathers he will make distribution among them of goods taken in war and by force and of property he will even make designs against the strong places for a time
Dan  And he will put in motion his power and his strength against the king of the south with a great army and the king of the south will go to war with a very great and strong army but he will be forced to give way because of their designs against him
Dan  And his fears will overcome him and be the cause of his downfall and his army will come to complete destruction and a great number will be put to the sword
Dan  And as for these two kings their hearts will be fixed on doing evil and they will say false words at one table but it will come to nothing for the end will be at the time fixed
Dan  And he will go back to his land with great wealth and his heart will be against the holy agreement and he will do his pleasure and go back to his land
Dan  At the time fixed he will come back and come into the south but in the later time it will not be as it was before
Dan  For those who go out from the west will come against him and he will be in fear and will go back full of wrath against the holy agreement and he will do his pleasure and he will go back and be united with those who have given up the holy agreement
Dan  And armies sent by him will take up their position and they will make unclean the holy place even the strong place and take away the regular burned offering and put in its place an unclean thing causing fear
Dan  And those who do evil against the agreement will be turned to sin by his fair words but the people who have knowledge of their God will be strong and do well
Dan  And those who are wise among the people will be the teachers of the mass of the people but they will come to their downfall by the sword and by the flame being made prisoners and undergoing loss for a long time
Dan  Now at the time of their downfall they will have a little help but numbers will be joined to them in the town and in their separate heritages
Dan  And some of those who are wise will have wisdom in testing themselves and making themselves clean till the time of the end for it is still for the fixed time
Dan  And the king will do his pleasure he will put himself on high lifting himself over every god and saying things to be wondered at against the God of gods and all will be well for him till the wrath is complete for what has been purposed will be done
Dan  He will have no respect for the gods of his fathers or for the god desired by women he will have no respect for any god for he will put himself on high over all
Dan  But in place of this he will give honour to the god of armed places and to a god of whom his fathers had no knowledge he will give honour with gold and silver and jewels and things to be desired
Dan  And he will make use of the people of a strange god to keep his strongest places to those whom he takes note of he will give high honour and he will make them rulers over the mass of the people and will make division of the land for a price
Dan  And at the time of the end the king of the south will make an attack on him and the king of the north will come against him like a stormwind with warcarriages and horsemen and numbers of ships and he will go through many lands like overflowing waters
Dan  And he will come into the beautiful land and tens of thousands will be overcome but these will be kept from falling into his hands Edom and Moab and the chief of the children of Ammon
Dan  And his hand will be stretched out on the countries and the land of the south will not be safe from him
Dan  But he will have power over the stores of gold and silver and over all the valued things of the south and the Libyans and the Ethiopians will be at his steps
Dan  But he will be troubled by news from the east and from the north and he will go out in great wrath to send destruction on and put an end to great numbers
Dan  He will put the tents of his great house between the sea and the beautiful holy mountain but he will come to his end with no helper
Dan  And at that time Michael will take up his place the great angel who is the supporter of the children of your people and there will be a time of trouble such as there never was from the time there was a nation even till that same time and at that time your people will be kept safe everyone who is recorded in the book
Dan  And a number of those who are sleeping in the dust of the earth will come out of their sleep some to eternal life and some to eternal shame
Dan  And those who are wise will be shining like the light of the outstretched sky and those by whom numbers have been turned to righteousness will be like the stars for ever and ever
Dan  But as for you O Daniel let the words be kept secret and the book rolled up and kept shut till the time of the end numbers will be going out of the way and troubles will be increased
Dan  Then I Daniel looking saw two others one at the edge of the river on this side and one at the edge of the river on that side
Dan  And I said to the man clothed in linen who was over the waters of the river How long will it be to the end of these wonders
Dan  Then in my hearing the man clothed in linen who was over the river lifting up his right hand and his left hand to heaven took an oath by him who is living for ever that it would be a time times and a half and when the power of the crusher of the holy people comes to an end all these things will be ended
Dan  And the words came to my ears but the sense of them was not clear to me then I said O my lord what is the sense of these things
Dan  And he said Go on your way Daniel for the words are secret and shut up till the time of the end
Dan  Till a number are tested and make themselves clean and the evildoers will do evil for not one of the evildoers will have knowledge but all will be made clear to those who are wise
Dan  And from the time when the regular burned offering is taken away and an unclean thing causing fear is put up there will be a thousand two hundred and ninety days
Dan  A blessing will be on the man who goes on waiting and comes to the thousand three hundred and thirtyfive days
Dan  But you go on your way and take your rest for you will be in your place at the end of the days
Hos  The word of the Lord which came to Hosea the son of Beeri in the days of Uzziah Jotham Ahaz and Hezekiah kings of Judah and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel
Hos  The start of the word of the Lord by Hosea And the Lord said to Hosea Go take for yourself a wife of loose ways and children of the same for the land has been untrue to the Lord
Hos  So he took as his wife Gomer the daughter of Diblaim and she gave birth to a son
Hos  And the Lord said to him Give him the name of Jezreel for after a little time I will send punishment for the blood of Jezreel on the line of Jehu and put an end to the kingdom of Israel
Hos  And in that day I will let the bow of Israel be broken in the valley of Jezreel
Hos  And after that she gave birth to a daughter And the Lord said Give her the name Loruhamah for I will not again have mercy on Israel to give them forgiveness
Hos  But I will have mercy on Judah and will give them salvation by the Lord their God but not by the bow or the sword or by fighting or by horses or horsemen
Hos  Now when Loruhamah had been taken from the breast the woman gave birth to a son
Hos  And the Lord said Give him the name Loammi for you are not my people and I will not be your God
Hos  But still the number of the children of Israel will be like the sand of the sea which may not be measured or numbered and in place of its being said to them You are not my people it will be said to them You are the sons of the living God
Hos  And the children of Israel and the children of Judah will come together and take for themselves one head and will go up from the land for great will be the day of Jezreel
Hos  Say to your brothers Ammi and to your sisters Ruhamah
Hos  Take up the cause against your mother take it up for she is not my wife and I am not her husband let her put away her loose ways from her face and her false ways from between her breasts
Hos  For fear that I may take away her robe from her making her uncovered as in the day of her birth making her like a waste place and a dry land causing her death through need of water
Hos  And I will have no mercy on her children for they are the children of her loose ways
Hos  For their mother has been untrue she who gave them birth has done things of shame for she said I will go after my lovers who give me my bread and my water my wool and my linen my oil and my wine
Hos  For this cause I will put thorns in her road building up a wall round her so that she may not go on her way
Hos  And if she goes after her lovers she will not overtake them if she makes search for them she will not see them then will she say I will go back to my first husband for then it was better for me than now
Hos  For she had no knowledge that it was I who gave her the grain and the wine and the oil increasing her silver and gold which they gave to the Baal
Hos  So I will take away again my grain in its time and my wine and I will take away my wool and my linen with which her body might have been covered
Hos  And now I will make her shame clear before the eyes of her lovers and no one will take her out of my hand
Hos  And I will put an end to all her joy her feasts her new moons and her Sabbaths and all her regular meetings
Hos  And I will make waste her vines and her figtrees of which she has said These are the payments which my lovers have made to me and I will make them a waste of trees and the beasts of the field will take them for food
Hos  And I will give her punishment for the days of the Baals to whom she has been burning perfumes when she made herself fair with her noserings and her jewels and went after her lovers giving no thought to me says the Lord
Hos  For this cause I will make her come into the waste land and will say words of comfort to her
Hos  And I will give her vinegardens from there and the valley of Achor for a door of hope and she will give her answer there as in the days when she was young and as in the time when she came up out of the land of Egypt
Hos  And in that day says the Lord you will say to me Ishi and you will never again give me the name of Baali
Hos  For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth and never again will she say their names
Hos  And in that day I will make an agreement for them with the beasts of the field and the birds of heaven and the things which go low on the earth I will put an end to the bow and the sword and war in all the land and will make them take their rest in peace
Hos  And I will take you as my bride for ever truly I will take you as my bride in righteousness and in right judging in love and in mercies
Hos  I will take you as my bride in good faith and you will have knowledge of the Lord
Hos  And it will be in that day says the Lord that I will give an answer to the heavens and the heavens to the earth
Hos  And the earth will give its answer to the grain and the wine and the oil and they will give an answer to Jezreel
Hos  And I will put her as seed in the earth and I will have mercy on her to whom no mercy was given and I will say to those who were not my people You are my people and they will say My God
Hos  And the Lord said to me Give your love again to a woman who has a lover and is false to her husband even as the Lord has love for the children of Israel though they are turned to other gods and are lovers of grapecakes
Hos  So I got her for myself for fifteen shekels of silver and a homer and a half of barley
Hos  And I said to her You are to be mine for a long space of time you are not to be false to me and no other man is to have you for his wife and so will I be to you
Hos  For the children of Israel will for a long time be without king and without ruler without offerings and without pillars and without ephod or images
Hos  And after that the children of Israel will come back and go in search of the Lord their God and David their king and they will come in fear to the Lord and to his mercies in the days to come
Hos  Give ear to the word of the Lord O children of Israel for the Lord has a cause against the people of this land because there is no good faith in it and no mercy and no knowledge of God in the land
Hos  There is cursing and broken faith violent death and attacks on property men are untrue in married life houses are broken into and there is blood touching blood
Hos  Because of this the land will be dry and everyone living in it will be wasted away with the beasts of the field and the birds of heaven even the fishes of the sea will be taken away
Hos  Let no man go to law or make protests for your people are like those who go to law with a priest
Hos  You will not be able to keep on your feet by day and by night the prophet will be falling down with you and I will give your mother to destruction
Hos  Destruction has overtaken my people because they have no knowledge because you have given up knowledge I will give you up so that you will be no priest to me because you have not kept in mind the law of your God I will not keep your children in my memory
Hos  Even while they were increasing in number they were sinning against me I will let their glory be changed into shame
Hos  The sin of my people is like food to them and their desire is for their wrongdoing
Hos  And the priest will be like the people I will give them punishment for their evil ways and the reward of their acts
Hos  They will have food but they will not be full they will be false to me but they will not be increased because they no longer give thought to the Lord
Hos  Loose ways and new wine take away wisdom
Hos  My people get knowledge from their tree and their rod gives them news for a false spirit is the cause of their wandering and they have been false to their God
Hos  They make offerings on the tops of mountains burning perfumes in high places under trees of every sort because their shade is good and so your daughters are given up to loose ways and your brides are false to their husbands
Hos  I will not give punishment to your daughters or your brides for their evil behaviour for they make themselves separate with loose women and make offerings with those who are used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods the people who have no wisdom will be sent away
Hos  Do not you O Israel come into error do not you O Judah come to Gilgal or go up to Bethaven or take an oath By the living Lord
Hos  For Israel is uncontrolled like a cow which may not be controlled now will the Lord give them food like a lamb in a wide place
Hos  Ephraim is joined to false gods let him be
Hos  Their drink has become bitter they are completely false her rulers take pleasure in shame
Hos  They are folded in the skirts of the wind they will be shamed because of their offerings
Hos  Give ear to this O priests give attention O Israel and you family of the king for you are to be judged you have been a deceit at Mizpah and a net stretched out on Tabor
Hos  They have gone deep in the evil ways of Shittim but I am the judge of all
Hos  I have knowledge of Ephraim and Israel is not secret from me for now O Ephraim you have been false to me Israel has become unclean
Hos  Their works will not let them come back to their God for a false spirit is in them and they have no knowledge of the Lord
Hos  And the pride of Israel gives an answer to his face and Ephraim will have a fall through his sins and the fall of Judah will be the same as theirs
Hos  They will go with their flocks and their herds in search of the Lord but they will not see him he has taken himself out of their view
Hos  They have been false to the Lord they have given birth to strange children now the new moon will make them waste with their fields
Hos  Let the horn be sounded in Gibeah and in Ramah give a loud cry in Bethaven They are after you O Benjamin
Hos  Ephraim will become a waste in the day of punishment I have given knowledge among the tribes of Israel of what is certain
Hos  The rulers of Judah are like those who take away a landmark I will let loose my wrath on them like flowing water
Hos  Ephraim is troubled he is crushed by his judges because he took pleasure in walking after deceit
Hos  And so to Ephraim I am like a wasting insect and a destruction to the children of Judah
Hos  When Ephraim saw his disease and Judah his wound then Ephraim went to Assyria and sent to the great king but he is not able to make you well or give you help for your wound
Hos  For I will be to Ephraim as a lion and as a young lion to the children of Judah I even I will give him wounds and go away I will take him away and there will be no helper
Hos  I will go back to my place till they are made waste in their trouble they will go after me early and will make search for me
Hos  Come let us go back to the Lord for he has given us wounds and he will make us well he has given blows and he will give help
Hos  After two days he will give us life and on the third day he will make us get up and we will be living before him
Hos  And let us have knowledge let us go after the knowledge of the Lord his going out is certain as the dawn his decisions go out like the light he will come to us like the rain like the spring rain watering the earth
Hos  O Ephraim what am I to do to you O Judah what am I to do to you For your love is like a morning cloud and like the dew which goes early away
Hos  So I have had it cut in stones I gave them teaching by the words of my mouth
Hos  Because my desire is for mercy and not offerings for the knowledge of God more than for burned offerings
Hos  But like a man they have gone against the agreement there they were false to me
Hos  Gilead is a town of evildoers marked with blood
Hos  And like a band of thieves waiting for a man so are the priests watching secretly the way of those going quickly to Shechem for they are working with an evil design
Hos  In Israel I have seen a very evil thing there false ways are seen in Ephraim Israel is unclean
Hos  And Judah has put up disgusting images for himself
Hos  When my desire was for the fate of my people to be changed and to make Israel well then the sin of Ephraim was made clear and the evildoing of Samaria for their ways are false and the thief comes into the house while the band of outlaws takes property by force in the streets
Hos  And they do not say to themselves that I keep in mind all their sin now their evil acts come round them on every side they are before my face
Hos  In their sin they make a king for themselves and rulers in their deceit
Hos  They are all untrue they are like a burning oven the breadmaker does not make up the fire from the time when the paste is mixed till it is leavened
Hos  On the day of our king the rulers made him ill with the heat of wine his hand was stretched out with the men of pride
Hos  For they have made their hearts ready like an oven while they are waiting secretly their wrath is sleeping all night in the morning it is burning like a flaming fire
Hos  They are all heated like an oven and they put an end to their judges all their kings have been made low not one among them makes prayer to me
Hos  Ephraim is mixed with the peoples Ephraim is a cake not turned
Hos  Men from other lands have made waste his strength and he is not conscious of it grey hairs have come on him here and there and he has no knowledge of it
Hos  And the pride of Israel gives an answer to his face but for all this they have not gone back to the Lord their God or made search for him
Hos  And Ephraim is like a foolish dove without wisdom they send out their cry to Egypt they go to Assyria
Hos  When they go my net will be stretched out over them I will take them like the birds of heaven I will give them punishment I will take them away in the net for their sin
Hos  May trouble be theirs for they have gone far away from me and destruction for they have been sinning against me I was ready to be their saviour but they said false words against me
Hos  And they have not made prayer to me in their hearts but they make loud cries on their beds they are cutting themselves for food and wine they are turned against me
Hos  Though I have given training and strength to their arms they have evil designs against me
Hos  They have gone to what is of no value they are like a false bow their captains will come to destruction by the sword and their ruler by my wrath for this the land of Egypt will make sport of them
Hos  Put the horn to your mouth He comes like an eagle against the house of the Lord because they have gone against my agreement they have not kept my law
Hos  They will send up to me a cry for help We Israel have knowledge of you O God of Israel
Hos  Israel has given up what is good his haters will go after him
Hos  They have put up kings but not by me they have made princes but I had no knowledge of it they have made images of silver and gold so that they may be cut off
Hos  I will have nothing to do with your young ox O Samaria my wrath is burning against them how long will it be before the children of Israel make themselves clean
Hos  The workman made it it is no god the ox of Samaria will be broken into bits
Hos  For they have been planting the wind and their fruit will be the storm his grain has no stem it will give no meal and if it does a strange nation will take it
Hos  Israel has come to destruction now they are among the nations like a cup in which there is no pleasure
Hos  For they have gone up to Assyria like an ass going by himself Ephraim has given money to get lovers
Hos  But though they give money to the nations for help still I will send them in all directions and in a short time they will be without a king and rulers
Hos  Because Ephraim has been increasing altars for sin altars have become a cause of sin to him
Hos  Though I put my law in writing for him in ten thousand rules they are to him as a strange thing
Hos  He gives the offerings of his lovers and takes the flesh for food but the Lord has no pleasure in them now he will keep in mind their evildoing and give them the punishment of their sins they will go back to Egypt
Hos  For Israel has no memory of his Maker and has put up the houses of kings and Judah has made great the number of his walled towns But I will send a fire on his towns and put an end to his great houses
Hos  Have no joy O Israel and do not be glad like the nations for you have been untrue to your God your desire has been for the loose womans reward on every grainfloor
Hos  The grainfloor and the place where the grapes are crushed will not give them food there will be no new wine for them
Hos  They will have no restingplace in the Lords land but Ephraim will go back to Egypt and they will take unclean food in Assyria
Hos  They will give no wine offering to the Lord they will not make offerings ready for him their bread will be like the bread of those in sorrow all who take it will be unclean because their bread will be only for their desire it will not come into the house of the Lord
Hos  What will you do on the day of worship and on the day of the feast of the Lord
Hos  For see they are going away into Assyria Egypt will get them together Memphis will be their last restingplace their fair silver vessels will be covered over with field plants and thorns will come up in their tents
Hos  The days of punishment the days of reward are come Israel will be put to shame the prophet is foolish the man who has the spirit is off his head because of your great sin
Hos  There is great hate against the watchman of Ephraim the people of my God as for the prophet there is a net in all his ways and hate in the house of his God
Hos  They have gone deep in evil as in the days of Gibeah he will keep in mind their wrongdoing he will give them punishment for their sins
Hos  I made discovery of Israel as of grapes in the waste land I saw your fathers as the firstfruits of the figtree in her early fruit time but they came to Baalpeor and made themselves holy to the thing of shame and became disgusting like that to which they gave their love
Hos  As for Ephraim their glory will go in flight like a bird there will be no birth and no one with child and no giving of life
Hos  Even though their children have come to growth I will take them away so that not a man will be there for their evildoing will be complete and they will be put to shame because of it
Hos  As I have seen a beast whose young have been taken from her so Ephraim will give birth to children only for them to be put to death
Hos  O Lord what will you give them Give them bodies which may not give birth and breasts without milk
Hos  All their evildoing is in Gilgal there I had hate for them because of their evildoing I will send them out of my house they will no longer be dear to me all their rulers are uncontrolled
Hos  The rod has come on Ephraim their root is dry let them have no fruit even though they give birth I will put to death the dearest fruit of their bodies
Hos  My God will give them up because they did not give ear to him they will be wandering among the nations
Hos  Israel is a branching vine full of fruit as his fruit is increased so the number of his altars is increased as the land is fair so they have made fair pillars
Hos  Their mind is taken away now they will be made waste he will have their altars broken down he will give their pillars to destruction
Hos  Now truly they will say We have no king we have no fear of the Lord and the king what is he able to do for us
Hos  Their words are foolish they make agreements with false oaths so punishment will come up like a poisonplant in a ploughed field
Hos  The people of Samaria will be full of fear because of the ox of Bethaven its people will have sorrow for it and its priests will give cries of grief for its glory for the glory has gone in flight
Hos  And they will take it to Assyria and give it to the great king shame will come on Ephraim and Israel will be shamed because of its image
Hos  As for Samaria her king is cut off like mist on the water
Hos  And the high places of Aven the sin of Israel will come to destruction thorns and waste plants will come up on their altars they will say to the mountains Be a cover over us and to the hills Come down on us
Hos  O Israel you have done evil from the days of Gibeah there they took up their position so that the fighting against the children of evil might not overtake them in Gibeah
Hos  I will come and give them punishment and the peoples will come together against them when I give them the reward of their two sins
Hos  And Ephraim is a trained cow taking pleasure in crushing the grain but I have put a yoke on her fair neck I will put a horseman on the back of Ephraim Judah will be working the plough Jacob will be turning up the earth
Hos  Put in the seed of righteousness get in your grain in mercy let your unploughed earth be turned up for it is time to make search for the Lord till he comes and sends righteousness on you like rain
Hos  You have been ploughing sin you have got in a store of evil the fruit of deceit has been your food for you put faith in your way in the number of your men of war
Hos  So a great outcry will go up from among your people and all your strong places will be broken as Betharbel was broken by Shalman in the day of war as the mother was broken on the rocks with her children
Hos  So will Bethel do to you because of your evildoing at dawn will the king of Israel be cut off completely
Hos  When Israel was a child he was dear to me and I took my son out of Egypt
Hos  When I sent for them then they went away from me they made offerings to the Baals burning perfumes to images
Hos  But I was guiding Ephraims footsteps I took them up in my arms but they were not conscious that I was ready to make them well
Hos  I made them come after me with the cords of a man with the bands of love I was to them as one who took the yoke from off their mouths putting meat before them
Hos  He will go back to the land of Egypt and the Assyrian will be his king because they would not come back to me
Hos  And the sword will go through his towns wasting his children and causing destruction because of their evil designs
Hos  My people are given up to sinning against me though their voice goes up on high no one will be lifting them up
Hos  How may I give you up O Ephraim how may I be your saviour O Israel how may I make you like Admah how may I do to you as I did to Zeboim My heart is turned in me it is soft with pity
Hos  I will not put into effect the heat of my wrath I will not again send destruction on Ephraim for I am God and not man the Holy One among you I will not put an end to you
Hos  They will go after the Lord his cry will be like that of a lion his cry will be loud and the children will come from the west shaking with fear
Hos  Shaking with fear like a bird they will come out of Egypt like a dove out of the land of Assyria and I will give them rest in their houses says the Lord
Hos  The deceit of Ephraim and the false words of Israel are about me on every side 
Hos  Ephraims food is the wind and he goes after the east wind deceit and destruction are increasing day by day they make an agreement with Assyria and take oil into Egypt
Hos  The Lord has a cause against Judah and will give punishment to Jacob for his ways he will give him the reward of his acts
Hos  In the body of his mother he took his brother by the foot and in his strength he was fighting with God
Hos  He had a fight with the angel and overcame him he made request for grace to him with weeping he came face to face with him in Bethel and there his words came to him
Hos  Even the Lord the God of armies the Lord is his name
Hos  So then come back to your God keep mercy and right and be waiting at all times on your God
Hos  As for Canaan the scales of deceit are in his hands he takes pleasure in twisted ways
Hos  And Ephraim said Now I have got wealth and much property in all my works no sin may be seen in me
Hos  But I am the Lord your God from the land of Egypt I will give you tents for your livingplaces again as in the days of the holy meeting
Hos  My word came to the ears of the prophets and I gave them visions in great number and by the mouths of the prophets I made use of comparisons
Hos  In Gilead there is evil They are quite without value in Gilgal they make offerings of oxen truly their altars are like masses of stones in the hollows of a ploughed field
Hos  And Jacob went in flight into the field of Aram and Israel became a servant for a wife and for a wife he kept sheep
Hos  And by a prophet the Lord made Israel come up out of Egypt and by a prophet he was kept safe
Hos  I have been bitterly moved to wrath by Ephraim so that his blood will be on him and the Lord will make his shame come back on him
Hos  When the words of my law came from Ephraim he was lifted up in Israel but when he did evil through the Baal death overtook him
Hos  And now their sins are increased they have made themselves a metal image false gods from their silver after their designs all of them the work of the metalworkers they say of them Let them give offerings let men give kisses to the oxen
Hos  So they will be like the morning cloud like the dew which goes early away like the dust of the grain which the wind is driving out of the crushingfloor like smoke going up from the fireplace
Hos  But I am the Lord your God from the land of Egypt you have knowledge of no other God and there is no saviour but me
Hos  I had knowledge of you in the waste land where no water was
Hos  When I gave them food they were full and their hearts were full of pride and they did not keep me in mind
Hos  So I will be like a lion to them as a cruel beast I will keep watch by the road
Hos  I will come face to face with them like a bear whose young ones have been taken from her and their inmost hearts will be broken there the dogs will make a meal of them they will be wounded by the beasts of the field
Hos  I have sent destruction on you O Israel who will be your helper
Hos  Where is your king that he may be your saviour and all your rulers that they may take up your cause of whom you said Give me a king and rulers
Hos  I have given you a king because I was angry and have taken him away in my wrath
Hos  The wrongdoing of Ephraim is shut up his sin is put away in secret
Hos  The pains of a woman in childbirth will come on him he is an unwise son for at this time it is not right for him to keep his place when children come to birth
Hos  I will give the price to make them free from the power of the underworld I will be their saviour from death O death where are your pains O underworld where is your destruction my eyes will have no pity
Hos  Though he gives fruit among his brothers an east wind will come the wind of the Lord coming up from the waste land and his spring will become dry his fountain will be without water it will make waste the store of all the vessels of his desire
Hos  Samaria will be made waste for she has gone against her God they will be cut down by the sword their little children will be broken on the rocks their women who are with child will be cut open
Hos  O Israel come back to the Lord your God for your evildoing has been the cause of your fall
Hos  Take with you words and come back to the Lord say to him Let there be forgiveness for all wrongdoing so that we may take what is good and give in payment the fruit of our lips
Hos  Assyria will not be our salvation we will not go on horses we will not again say to the work of our hands You are our gods for in you there is mercy for the child who has no father
Hos  I will put right their errors freely will my love be given to them for my wrath is turned away from him
Hos  I will be as the dew to Israel he will put out flowers like a lily and send out his roots like Lebanon
Hos  His branches will be stretched out he will be beautiful as the olivetree and sweetsmelling as Lebanon
Hos  They will come back and have rest in his shade their life will be made new like the grain and they will put out flowers like the vine his name will be like the wine of Lebanon
Hos  As for Ephraim what has he to do with false gods any longer I have given an answer and I will keep watch over him I am like a branching firtree from me comes your fruit
Hos  He who is wise will see these things he who has good sense will have knowledge of them For the ways of the Lord are straight and the upright will go in them but sinners will be falling in them
Joe  The word of the Lord which came to Joel the son of Pethuel
Joe  Give ear to this you old men and take note you people of the land Has this ever been in your days or in the days of your fathers
Joe  Give the story of it to your children and let them give it to their children and their children to another generation

Joe  Come out of your sleep you who are overcome with wine and give yourselves to weeping give cries of sorrow all you drinkers of wine because of the sweet wine for it has been cut off from your mouths
Joe  For a nation has come up over my land strong and without number his teeth are the teeth of a lion and he has the back teeth of a great lion
Joe  By him my vine is made waste and my figtree broken he has taken all its fruit and sent it down to the earth its branches are made white

Joe  The vine has become dry and the figtree is feeble the pomegranate and the palmtree and the appletree even all the trees of the field are dry because joy has gone from the sons of men
Joe  Put haircloth round you and give yourselves to sorrow you priests give cries of grief you servants of the altar come in and clothed in haircloth let the night go past you servants of my God for the meal offering and the drink offering have been kept back from the house of your God

Joe  Before them fire sends destruction and after them flame is burning the land is like the garden of Eden before them and after them an unpeopled waste truly nothing has been kept safe from them
Joe  Their form is like the form of horses and they are running like warhorses
Joe  Like the sound of warcarriages they go jumping on the tops of the mountains like the noise of a flame of fire burning up the grainstems like a strong people lined up for the fight
Joe  At their coming the people are bent with pain all faces become red together
Joe  They are running like strong men they go over the wall like men of war every man goes straight on his way their lines are not broken
Joe  No one is pushing against another everyone goes straight on his way bursting through the sword points their order is not broken
Joe  They make a rush on the town running on the wall they go up into the houses and in through the windows like a thief
Joe  The earth is troubled before them and the heavens are shaking the sun and the moon have become dark and the stars keep back their shining
Joe  And the Lord is thundering before his forces for very great is his army for he is strong who gives effect to his word for the day of the Lord is great and greatly to be feared and who has strength against it
Joe  But even now says the Lord come back to me with all your heart keeping from food with weeping and with sorrow
Joe  Let your hearts be broken and not your clothing and come back to the Lord your God for he is full of grace and pity slow to be angry and great in mercy ready to be turned from his purpose of punishment

Joe  Let the priests the servants of the Lord be weeping between the covered way and the altar and let them say Have mercy on your people O Lord do not give up your heritage to shame so that the nations become their rulers why let them say among the peoples Where is their God
Joe  Then the Lord had a care for the honour of his land and had pity on his people
Joe  And the Lord made answer and said to his people See I will send you grain and wine and oil in full measure and I will no longer let you be shamed among the nations
Joe  I will send the one from the north far away from you driving him into a dry and waste land with his front to the sea of the east and his back to the sea of the west and the smell of him will go up even his evil smell will go up
Joe  Have no fear O land be glad with great joy for the Lord has done great things

Joe  And after that it will come about says the Lord that I will send my spirit on all flesh and your sons and your daughters will be prophets your old men will have dreams your young men will see visions
Joe  And on the servants and the servantgirls in those days I will send my spirit
Joe  And I will let wonders be seen in the heavens and on the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke
Joe  The sun will be made dark and the moon turned to blood before the great day of the Lord comes a day to be feared
Joe  And it will be that whoever makes his prayer to the name of the Lord will be kept safe for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem some will be kept safe as the Lord has said and will be among the small band marked out by the Lord
Joe  For in those days and in that time when I let the fate of Judah and Jerusalem be changed
Joe  I will get together all the nations and make them come down into the valley of Jehoshaphat and there I will take up with them the cause of my people and of my heritage Israel whom they have sent wandering among the nations and of my land which has been parted by them
Joe  And they have put the fate of my people to the decision of chance giving a boy for the price of a loose woman and a girl for a drink of wine
Joe  And further what are you to me O Tyre and Zidon and all the circle of Philistia will you give me back any payment and if you do quickly and suddenly I will send it back on your head
Joe  For you have taken my silver and my gold putting in the houses of your gods my beautiful and pleasing things
Joe  And the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem you have given for a price to the sons of the Greeks to send them far away from their land
Joe  See I will have them moved from the place where you have sent them and will let what you have done come back on your head
Joe  I will give your sons and your daughters into the hands of the children of Judah for a price and they will give them for a price to the men of Sheba a nation far off for the Lord has said it
Joe  Give this out among the nations make ready for war get the strong men awake let all the men of war come near let them come up
Joe  Get your ploughblades hammered into swords and your vineknives into spears let the feeble say I am strong
Joe  Come quickly all you nations round about and get yourselves together there make your strong ones come down O Lord
Joe  Let the nations be awake and come to the valley of Jehoshaphat for there I will be seated as judge of all the nations round about
Joe  Put in the blade for the grain is ready come get you down for the winecrusher is full the vessels are overflowing for great is their evildoing
Joe  Masses on masses in the valley of decision for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision
Joe  The sun and the moon have become dark and the stars keep back their shining
Joe  And the Lord will be thundering from Zion and his voice will be sounding from Jerusalem and the heavens and the earth will be shaking but the Lord will be a breastplate for his people and a strong place for the children of Israel
Joe  And you will be certain that I am the Lord your God living in Zion my holy mountain and Jerusalem will be holy and no strange person will ever again go through her
Joe  And it will come about in that day that the mountains will be dropping sweet wine and the hills will be flowing with milk and all the streams of Judah will be flowing with water and a fountain will come out from the house of the Lord watering the valley of acaciatrees
Joe  Egypt will be a waste and Edom a land of destruction because of the evil done to the children of Judah because they have let blood be drained out in their land without cause
Joe  But Judah will be peopled for ever and Jerusalem from generation to generation
Joe  And I will send punishment for their blood for which punishment has not been sent for the Lord is living in Zion

Amo  And you will go out through the broken places every one going straight before her and you will be sent into Harmon says the Lord
Amo  Come to Bethel and do evil to Gilgal increasing the number of your sins come with your offerings every morning and your tenths every three days
Amo  Let that which is leavened be burned as a praiseoffering let the news of your free offerings be given out publicly for this is pleasing to you O children of Israel says the Lord
Amo  But in all your towns I have kept food from your teeth and in all your places there has been need of bread and still you have not come back to me says the Lord
Amo  And I have kept back the rain from you when it was still three months before the graincutting I sent rain on one town and kept it back from another one part was rained on and the part where there was no rain became a waste
Amo  So two or three towns went wandering to one town looking for water and did not get enough and still you have not come back to me says the Lord
Amo  I have sent destruction on your fields by burning and disease the increase of your gardens and your vinegardens your figtrees and your olivetrees has been food for worms and still you have not come back to me says the Lord
Amo  I have sent disease among you as it was in Egypt I have put your young men to the sword and have taken away your horses I have made the evil smell from your tents come up to your noses and still you have not come back to me says the Lord
Amo  And I have sent destruction among you as when God sent destruction on Sodom and Gomorrah and you were like a burning stick pulled out of the fire and still you have not come back to me says the Lord
Amo  So this is what I will do to you O Israel and because I will do this to you be ready for a meeting with your God O Israel
Amo  For see he who gave form to the mountains and made the wind giving knowledge of his purpose to man who makes the morning dark and is walking on the high places of the earth the Lord the God of armies is his name
Amo  Give ear to this word my song of sorrow over you O children of Israel
Amo  The virgin of Israel has been made low never again to be lifted up she is stretched out by herself on her land there is no one to put her on her feet again
Amo  For these are the words of the Lord God The town which was able to send out a thousand will have only a hundred and that which sent out a hundred will have only ten in Israel
Amo  For these are the words of the Lord to the children of Israel Let your hearts be turned to me so that you may have life
Amo  Do not be looking for help to Bethel and do not go to Gilgal or make your way to Beersheba for Gilgal will certainly be taken prisoner and Bethel will come to nothing
Amo  Go to the Lord for help so that you may have life for fear that he may come like fire bursting out in the family of Joseph causing destruction and there will be no one to put it out in Bethel
Amo  You who make the work of judging a bitter thing crushing down righteousness to the earth
Amo  Go for help to him who makes Orion and the Pleiades by whom the deep dark is turned into morning who makes the day black with night whose voice goes out to the waters of the sea sending them out over the face of the earth the Lord is his name
Amo  Who sends sudden destruction on the strong so that destruction comes on the walled town
Amo  They have hate for him who makes protest against evil in the public place and he whose words are upright is disgusting to them
Amo  So because the poor man is crushed under your feet and you take taxes from him of grain you have made for yourselves houses of cut stone but you will not take your rest in them the fair vinegardens planted by your hands will not give you wine
Amo  For I have seen how your evildoing is increased and how strong are your sins you troublers of the upright who take rewards and do wrong to the cause of the poor in the public place
Amo  So the wise will say nothing in that time for it is an evil time
Amo  Go after good and not evil so that life may be yours and so the Lord the God of armies will be with you as you say
Amo  Be haters of evil and lovers of good and let right be done in the public place it may be that the Lord the God of armies will have mercy on the rest of Joseph
Amo  So these are the words of the Lord the God of armies the Lord There will be weeping in all the open spaces and in all the streets they will say Sorrow sorrow and they will get in the farmer to the weeping and the makers of sad songs to give cries of grief
Amo  In all the vinegardens there will be cries of grief for I will go through among you says the Lord
Amo  Sorrow to you who are looking for the day of the Lord what is the day of the Lord to you it is dark and not light
Amo  As if a man running away from a lion came face to face with a bear or went into the house and put his hand on the wall and got a bite from a snake
Amo  Will not the day of the Lord be dark and not light even very dark with no light shining in it
Amo  Your feasts are disgusting to me I will have nothing to do with them I will take no delight in your holy meetings
Amo  Even if you give me your burned offerings and your meal offerings I will not take pleasure in them I will have nothing to do with the peaceofferings of your fat beasts
Amo  Take away from me the noise of your songs my ears are shut to the melody of your instruments
Amo  But let the right go rolling on like waters and righteousness like an everflowing stream
Amo  Did you come to me with offerings of beasts and meal offerings in the waste land for forty years O Israel
Amo  Truly you will take up Saccuth your king and Kaiwan your images the star of your god which you made for yourselves
Amo  And I will send you away as prisoners farther than Damascus says the Lord whose name is the God of armies
Amo  Sorrow to those who are resting in comfort in Zion and to those who have no fear of danger in the mountain of Samaria the noted men of the chief of the nations to whom the people of Israel come
Amo  Go on to Calneh and see and from there go to Hamath the great then go down to Gath of the Philistines are you better than these kingdoms or is your land wider than theirs
Amo  You who put far away the evil day causing the rule of the violent to come near
Amo  Who are resting on beds of ivory stretched out on soft seats feasting on lambs from the flock and young oxen from the cattlehouse
Amo  Making foolish songs to the sound of corded instruments and designing for themselves instruments of music like David
Amo  Drinking wine in basins rubbing themselves with the best oils but they have no grief for the destruction of Joseph
Amo  So now they will go away prisoners with the first of those who are made prisoners and the loud cry of those who were stretched out will come to an end
Amo  The Lord God has taken an oath by himself says the Lord the God of armies the pride of Jacob is disgusting to me and I have hate for his great houses so I will give up the town with everything in it
Amo  Then it will come about that if there are still ten men in a house death will overtake them
Amo  And when a mans relation even the one who is responsible for burning his body lifting him up to take his bones out of the house says to him who is in the inmost part of the house Is there still anyone with you and he says No then he will say Keep quiet for the name of the Lord may not be named
Amo  For see at the order of the Lord the great house will be full of cracks and the little house will be broken
Amo  Is it possible for horses to go running on the rock may the sea be ploughed with oxen for the right to be turned by you into poison and the fruit of righteousness into a bitter plant
Amo  You whose joy is in a thing of no value who say Have we not taken for ourselves horns by the strength which is ours
Amo  For see I will send against you a nation O Israel says the Lord the God of armies ruling you cruelly from the way into Hamath as far as the stream of the Arabah
Amo  This is what the Lord God let me see and I saw that when the growth of the late grass was starting he made locusts it was the late growth after the kings cutting was done
Amo  And it came about that after they had taken all the grass of the land I said O Lord God have mercy how will Jacob be able to keep his place for he is small
Amo  The Lord changing his purpose about this said It will not be
Amo  This is what the Lord let me see and I saw that the Lord God sent for a great fire to be the instrument of his punishment and after burning up the great deep it was about to put an end to the Lords heritage
Amo  Then said I O Lord God let there be an end how will Jacob be able to keep his place for he is small
Amo  The Lord changing his purpose about this said And this will not be
Amo  This is what he let me see and I saw the Lord stationed by a wall made straight by a weighted line and he had a weighted line in his hand
Amo  And the Lord said to me Amos what do you see And I said A weighted line Then the Lord said See I will let down a weighted line among my people Israel never again will my eyes be shut to their sin
Amo  And the high places of Isaac will be unpeopled and the holy places of Israel will be made waste and I will come up against the family of Jeroboam with the sword
Amo  Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel saying Amos has made designs against you among the people of Israel the land is troubled by his words
Amo  For Amos has said Jeroboam will be put to the sword and Israel will certainly be taken away as a prisoner out of his land
Amo  And Amaziah said to Amos O seer go in flight into the land of Judah and there get your living by working as a prophet
Amo  But be a prophet no longer at Bethel for it is the holy place of the king and the kings house
Amo  Then Amos in answer said to Amaziah I am no prophet or one of the sons of the prophets I am a herdman and one who takes care of sycamoretrees
Amo  And the Lord took me from the flock and the Lord said to me Go be a prophet to my people Israel
Amo  Now then give ear to the word of the Lord You say Be no prophet to Israel and say not a word against the people of Isaac
Amo  So this is what the Lord has said Your wife will be a loose woman in the town and your sons and your daughters will be put to the sword and your land will be cut up into parts by a line and you yourself will come to your end in an unclean land and Israel will certainly be taken away a prisoner out of his land
Amo  This is what the Lord God let me see and I saw a basket of summer fruit
Amo  And he said Amos what do you see And I said A basket of summer fruit Then the Lord said to me The end has come to my people Israel never again will my eyes be shut to their sin
Amo  And the songs of the kings house will be cries of pain in that day says the Lord God great will be the number of the dead bodies and everywhere they will put them out without a word
Amo  Give ear to this you who are crushing the poor and whose purpose is to put an end to those who are in need in the land
Amo  Saying When will the new moon be gone so that we may do trade in grain and the Sabbath so that we may put out in the market the produce of our fields making the measure small and the price great and trading falsely with scales of deceit
Amo  Getting the poor for silver and him who is in need for the price of two shoes and taking a price for the waste parts of the grain
Amo  The Lord has taken an oath by the pride of Jacob Truly I will ever keep in mind all their works
Amo  Will not the land be shaking with fear because of this and everyone in it have sorrow and all of it will be overflowing like the River and it will be troubled and go down again like the River of Egypt
Amo  And it will come about in that day says the Lord God that I will make the sun go down in the middle of the day and I will make the earth dark in daylight
Amo  Your feasts will be turned into sorrow and all your melody into songs of grief everyone will be clothed with haircloth and the hair of every head will be cut I will make the weeping like that for an only son and the end of it like a bitter day
Amo  See the days are coming says the Lord God when I will send times of great need on the land not need of food or desire for water but for hearing the words of the Lord
Amo  And they will go wandering from sea to sea and from the north even to the east running here and there in search of the word of the Lord and they will not get it
Amo  In that day the fair virgins and the young men will be feeble from need of water
Amo  Those who make their oaths by the sin of Samaria and say By the life of your God O Dan and By the living way of Beersheba even they will go down never again to be lifted up
Amo  I saw the Lord stationed by the side of the altar giving blows to the tops of the pillars so that the doorsteps were shaking and he said I will let all of them be broken with earthshocks I will put the last of them to the sword if any one of them goes in flight he will not get away not one of them will be safe
Amo  Even if they go deep into the underworld my hand will take them up from there if they go up to heaven I will get them down
Amo  Though they take cover on the top of Carmel I will go in search of them and get them out though they keep themselves from my eyes in the bed of the sea I will give orders to the great snake there and he will give them a bite
Amo  And though they are taken away as prisoners by their attackers even there will I give orders to the sword to put them to death my eyes will be fixed on them for evil and not for good
Amo  For the Lord the God of armies is he at whose touch the land is turned to water and everyone in it will be given up to sorrow all of it will be overflowing like the River and will go down again like the River of Egypt
Amo  It is he who makes his rooms in the heaven basing his arch on the earth whose voice goes out to the waters of the sea and sends them flowing over the face of the earth the Lord is his name
Amo  Are you not as the children of the Ethiopians to me O children of Israel says the Lord Have I not taken Israel up out of the land of Egypt and the Philistines from Caphtor and the Aramaeans from Kir
Amo  See the eyes of the Lord are on the evil kingdom and I will put an end to it in all the earth but I will not send complete destruction on Jacob says the Lord
Amo  For see I will give orders and I will have Israel moved about among all the nations as grain is moved about by the shaking of the tray but not the smallest seed will be dropped on the earth
Amo  All those sinners among my people will be put to the sword who say Evil will not overtake us or come face to face with us
Amo  In that day I will put up the tent of David which has come down and make good its broken places and I will put up again his damaged walls building it up as in the past
Amo  So that the rest of Edom may be their heritage and all the nations who have been named by my name says the Lord who is doing this
Amo  See the days will come says the Lord when the ploughman will overtake him who is cutting the grain and the crusher of the grapes him who is planting seed and sweet wine will be dropping from the mountains and the hills will be turned into streams of wine
Amo  And I will let the fate of my people Israel be changed and they will be building up again the waste towns and living in them they will again be planting vinegardens and taking the wine for their drink and they will make gardens and get the fruit of them
Amo  And I will have them planted in their land and never again will they be uprooted from their land which I have given them says the Lord your God
Oba  The vision of Obadiah This is what the Lord has said about Edom We have had word from the Lord and a representative has been sent among the nations saying Up and let us make war against her
Oba  See I have made you small among the nations you are much looked down on
Oba  You have been tricked by the pride of your heart O you whose livingplace is in the cracks of the rock whose house is high up who has said in his heart Who will make me come down to earth
Oba  Though you go up on high like an eagle though your house is placed among the stars I will make you come down from there says the Lord
Oba  If thieves came attacking you by night how are you cut off would they not go on taking till they had enough if men came cutting your grapes would they take them all
Oba  How are the things of Esau searched out how are his secret stores looked for
Oba  All the men who were united with you have been false to you driving you out to the edge of the land the men who were at peace with you have overcome you they have taken their heritage in your place
Oba  Will I not in that day says the Lord take away the wise men out of Edom and wisdom out of the mountain of Esau
Oba  And your men of war O Teman will be overcome with fear so that every one of them may be cut off from the mountain of Esau
Oba  Because you were the cause of violent death and because of your cruel behaviour to your brother Jacob you will be covered with shame and will be cut off for ever
Oba  Because you were there watching when men from other lands took away his goods and strange men came into his doors and put the fate of Jerusalem to the decision of chance you were like one of them
Oba  Do not see with pleasure your brothers evil day the day of his fate and do not be glad over the children of Judah on the day of their destruction or make wide your mouth on the day of trouble
Oba  Do not go into the doors of my people on the day of their downfall do not be looking on their trouble with pleasure on the day of their downfall or put your hands on their goods on the day of their downfall
Oba  And do not take your place at the crossroads cutting off those of his people who get away and do not give up to their haters those who are still there in the day of trouble
Oba  For the day of the Lord is coming quickly on all nations as you have done it will be done to you the reward of your acts will come on your head
Oba  For as you have been drinking on my holy mountain so will all the nations go on drinking without end they will go on drinking and the wine will go down their throats and they will be as if they had never been
Oba  But in Mount Zion some will be kept safe and it will be holy and the children of Jacob will take their heritage
Oba  And the children of Jacob will be a fire and those of Joseph a flame and the children of Esau dry stems of grass burned up by them till all is gone and there will be no people living in Esau for the Lord has said it
Oba  And they will take the South and the lowland and the country of Ephraim and Gilead as their heritage
Oba  And those of the children of Israel who were the first to be taken away as prisoners will have their heritage among the Canaanites as far as Zarephath and those who were taken away from Jerusalem who are in Sepharad will have the towns of the South
Oba  And those who have been kept safe will come up from Mount Zion to be judges of the mountain of Esau and the kingdom will be the Lords
Jon  And the word of the Lord came to Jonah the son of Amittai saying
Jon  Up go to Nineveh that great town and let your voice come to it for their evildoing has come up before me
Jon  And Jonah got up to go in flight to Tarshish away from the Lord and he went down to Joppa and saw there a ship going to Tarshish so he gave them the price of the journey and went down into it to go with them to Tarshish away from the Lord
Jon  And the Lord sent out a great wind on to the sea and there was a violent storm in the sea so that the ship seemed in danger of being broken
Jon  Then the sailors were full of fear every man crying to his god and the goods in the ship were dropped out into the sea to make the weight less But Jonah had gone down into the inmost part of the ship where he was stretched out in a deep sleep
Jon  And the ships captain came to him and said to him What are you doing sleeping Up say a prayer to your God if by chance God will give a thought to us so that we may not come to destruction
Jon  And they said to one another Come let us put this to the decision of chance and see on whose account this evil has come on us So they did so and Jonah was seen to be the man
Jon  Then they said to him Now make clear to us what is your work and where you come from what is your country and who are your people
Jon  And he said to them I am a Hebrew a worshipper of the Lord the God of heaven who made the sea and the dry land
Jon  And the men were in great fear and they said to him What is this you have done For the men had knowledge of his flight from the Lord because he had not kept it from them
Jon  And they said to him What are we to do to you so that the sea may become calm for us For the sea was getting rougher and rougher
Jon  And he said to them Take me up and put me into the sea and the sea will become calm for you for I am certain that because of me this great storm has come on you
Jon  And the men were working hard to get back to the land but they were not able to do so for the sea got rougher and rougher against them
Jon  So crying to the Lord they said Give ear to our prayer O Lord give ear and do not let destruction overtake us because of this mans life do not put on us the sin of taking life without cause for you O Lord have done what seemed good to you
Jon  So they took Jonah up and put him into the sea and the sea was no longer angry
Jon  Then great was the mens fear of the Lord and they made an offering to the Lord and took oaths to him
Jon  And the Lord made ready a great fish to take Jonah into its mouth and Jonah was inside the fish for three days and three nights
Jon  Then Jonah made prayer to the Lord his God from the inside of the fish and said
Jon  In my trouble I was crying to the Lord and he gave me an answer out of the deepest underworld I sent up a cry and you gave ear to my voice
Jon  For you have put me down into the deep into the heart of the sea and the river was round about me all your waves and your rolling waters went over me
Jon  And I said I have been sent away from before your eyes how may I ever again see your holy Temple
Jon  The waters were circling round me even to the neck the deep was about me the seagrass was twisted round my head
Jon  I went down to the bases of the mountains as for the earth her walls were about me for ever but you have taken up my life from the underworld O Lord my God
Jon  When my soul in me was overcome I kept the memory of the Lord and my prayer came in to you into your holy Temple
Jon  The worshippers of false gods have given up their only hope
Jon  But I will make an offering to you with the voice of praise I will give effect to my oaths Salvation is the Lords
Jon  And at the Lords order the fish sent Jonah out of its mouth on to the dry land
Jon  And the word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time saying
Jon  Up go to Nineveh that great town and give it the word which I have given you
Jon  So Jonah got up and went to Nineveh as the Lord had said Now Nineveh was a very great town three days journey from end to end
Jon  And Jonah first of all went a days journey into the town and crying out said In forty days destruction will overtake Nineveh
Jon  And the people of Nineveh had belief in God and a time was fixed for going without food and they put on haircloth from the greatest to the least
Jon  And the word came to the king of Nineveh and he got up from his seat of authority and took off his robe and covering himself with haircloth took his seat in the dust
Jon  And he had it given out in Nineveh By the order of the king and his great men no man or beast herd or flock is to have a taste of anything let them have no food or water
Jon  And let man and beast be covered with haircloth and let them make strong prayers to God and let everyone be turned from his evil way and the violent acts of their hands
Jon  Who may say that God will not be turned changing his purpose and turning away from his burning wrath so that destruction may not overtake us
Jon  And God saw what they did how they were turned from their evil way and Gods purpose was changed as to the evil which he said he would do to them and he did it not
Jon  But this seemed very wrong to Jonah and he was angry
Jon  And he made prayer to the Lord and said O Lord is this not what I said when I was still in my country This is why I took care to go in flight to Tarshish for I was certain that you were a loving God full of pity slow to be angry and great in mercy and ready to be turned from your purpose of evil
Jon  So now O Lord give ear to my prayer and take my life from me for death is better for me than life
Jon  And the Lord said Have you any right to be angry
Jon  Then Jonah went out of the town and took his seat on the east side of the town and made himself a roof of branches and took his seat under its shade till he saw what would become of the town
Jon  And the Lord God made a vine come up over Jonah to give him shade over his head And Jonah was very glad because of the vine
Jon  But early on the morning after God made ready a worm for the destruction of the vine and it became dry and dead
Jon  Then when the sun came up God sent a burning east wind and so great was the heat of the sun on his head that Jonah was overcome and requesting death for himself said Death is better for me than life
Jon  And the Lord said to Jonah Have you any right to be angry about the vine And he said I have a right to be truly angry
Jon  And the Lord said You had pity on the vine for which you did no work and for the growth of which you were not responsible which came up in a night and came to an end in a night
Jon  And am I not to have mercy on Nineveh that great town in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons without the power of judging between right and left as well as much cattle
Mic  The word of the Lord which came to Micah the Morashtite in the days of Jotham Ahaz and Hezekiah kings of Judah his vision about Samaria and Jerusalem
Mic  Give ear you peoples all of you give attention O earth and everything in it let the Lord God be witness against you the Lord from his holy Temple
Mic  For see the Lord is coming out from his place and will come down stepping on the high places of the earth
Mic  And the mountains will be turned to water under him and the deep valleys will be broken open like wax before the fire like waters flowing down a slope
Mic  All this is because of the wrongdoing of Jacob and the sins of the children of Israel What is the wrongdoing of Jacob is it not Samaria and what are the high places of Judah are they not Jerusalem
Mic  So I will make Samaria into a field and the plantings of a vinegarden I will send its stones falling down into the valley uncovering its bases
Mic  And all her pictured images will be hammered into bits and all the payments for her loose ways will be burned with fire and all the images of her gods I will make waste for with the price of a loose woman she got them together and as the price of a loose woman will they be given back
Mic  For this I will be full of sorrow and give cries of grief I will go uncovered and unclothed I will give cries of grief like the jackals and will be in sorrow like the ostriches
Mic  For her wounds may not be made well for it has come even to Judah stretching up to the doorway of my people even to Jerusalem
Mic  Give no word of it in Gath let there be no weeping at all at Bethleaphrah be rolling in the dust
Mic  Be uncovered and go away you who are living in Shaphir the one living in Zaanan has not come out of her town Bethezel is taken away from its base even from its restingplace
Mic  For the one living in Maroth is waiting for good for evil has come down from the Lord to the doorways of Jerusalem
Mic  Let the warcarriage be yoked to the quickrunning horse you who are living in Lachish she was the first cause of sin to the daughter of Zion for the wrongdoings of Israel were seen in you
Mic  For this cause give a parting offering to Moreshethgath the daughter of Achzib will be a deceit to the king of Israel
Mic  Even now will the taker of your heritage come to you you who are living in Mareshah the glory of Israel will come to destruction for ever
Mic  Let your head be uncovered and your hair cut off in sorrow for the children of your delight let the hair be pulled from your head like an eagles for they have been taken away from you as prisoners
Mic  A curse on the designers of evil working on their beds in the morning light they do it because it is in their power
Mic  They have a desire for fields and take them by force and for houses and take them away they are cruel to a man and his family even to a man and his heritage
Mic  For this cause the Lord has said See against this family I am purposing an evil from which you will not be able to take your necks away and you will be weighted down by it for it is an evil time
Mic  In that day this saying will be said about you and this song of grief will be made The heritage of my people is measured out and there is no one to give it back those who have made us prisoners have taken our fields from us and complete destruction has come to us
Mic  For this cause you will have no one to make the decision by the measuring line in the meeting of the Lord
Mic  Let not words like these be dropped they say Shame and the curse will not come to the family of Jacob
Mic  Is the Lord quickly made angry are these his doings do not his words do good to his people Israel
Mic  As for you you have become haters of those who were at peace with you you take the clothing of those who go by without fear and make them prisoners of war
Mic  The women of my people you have been driving away from their dearly loved children from their young ones you are taking my glory for ever
Mic  Up and go for this is not your rest because it has been made unclean the destruction ordered will come on you
Mic  If a man came with a false spirit of deceit saying I will be a prophet to you of wine and strong drink he would be the sort of prophet for this people
Mic  I will certainly make all of you O Jacob come together I will get together the rest of Israel I will put them together like the sheep in their circle like a flock in their green field they will be full of the noise of men
Mic  The opener of the way will go up before them forcing their way out they will go on to the doorway and out through it their king will go on before them and the Lord at their head
Mic  And I said Give ear now you heads of Jacob and rulers of the people of Israel is it not for you to have knowledge of what is right
Mic  You who are haters of good and lovers of evil pulling off their skin from them and their flesh from their bones
Mic  Like meat they take the flesh of my people for their food skinning them and crushing their bones yes cutting them up as if for the pot like flesh inside the cookingpot
Mic  Then they will be crying to the Lord for help but he will not give them an answer yes he will keep his face veiled from them at that time because their acts have been evil
Mic  This is what the Lord has said about the prophets by whom my people have been turned from the right way who biting with their teeth say Peace and if anyone puts nothing in their mouths they make ready for war against him
Mic  For this cause it will be night for you without a vision and it will be dark for you without knowledge of the future the sun will go down over the prophets and the day will be black over them
Mic  And the seers will be shamed and the readers of the future will be at a loss all of them covering their lips for there is no answer from God
Mic  But I truly am full of the spirit of the Lord with power of judging and with strength to make clear to Jacob his wrongdoing and to Israel his sin
Mic  Then give ear to this you heads of the children of Jacob you rulers of the children of Israel hating what is right twisting what is straight
Mic  They are building up Zion with blood and Jerusalem with evildoing
Mic  Its heads take rewards for judging and the priests take payment for teaching and the prophets get silver for reading the future but still supporting themselves on the Lord they say Is not the Lord among us no evil will overtake us
Mic  For this reason Zion will be ploughed like a field because of you and Jerusalem will become a mass of broken walls and the mountain of the house like a high place in the woods
Mic  But in the last days it will come about that the mountain of the Lords house will be placed on the top of the mountains and be lifted up over the hills and peoples will be flowing to it
Mic  And a number of nations will go and say Come and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord and to the house of the God of Jacob and he will give us knowledge of his ways and we will be guided by his word for from Zion the law will go out and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem
Mic  And he will be judge between great peoples and strong nations far away will be ruled by his decisions their swords will be hammered into ploughblades and their spears into vineknives nations will no longer be lifting up their swords against one another and knowledge of war will have gone for ever
Mic  But every man will be seated under his vine and under his figtree and no one will be a cause of fear to them for the mouth of the Lord of armies has said it
Mic  For all the peoples will be walking every one in the name of his god and we will be walking in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever
Mic  In that day says the Lord I will get together her who goes with uncertain steps I will get together her who has been sent away and her on whom I have sent evil
Mic  And I will make her whose steps were uncertain a small band and her who was feeble a strong nation and the Lord will be their King in Mount Zion from now and for ever
Mic  And you O tower of the flock Ophel of the daughter of Zion to you it will come even the earlier authority the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem
Mic  Now why are you crying so loudly is there no king in you has destruction come on your wise helper so that pains have taken you like the pains of a woman in childbirth
Mic  Be in pain make sounds of grief O daughter of Zion like a woman in childbirth for now you will go out of the town living in the open country and will come even to Babylon there you will have salvation there the Lord will make you free from the hands of your haters
Mic  And now a number of nations have come together against you and they say Let her be made unclean and let our eyes see the fate of Zion
Mic  But they have no knowledge of the thoughts of the Lord their minds are not able to see his purpose for he has got them together like stems of grain to the crushingfloor
Mic  Up and let the grain be crushed O daughter of Zion for I will make your horn iron and your feet brass and a number of peoples will be broken by you and you will give up their increase to the Lord and their wealth to the Lord of all the earth
Mic  Now you will give yourselves deep wounds for grief they will put up a wall round us they will give the judge of Israel a blow on the face with a rod
Mic  And you Bethlehem Ephrathah the least among the families of Judah out of you one will come to me who is to be ruler in Israel whose going out has been purposed from time past from the eternal days
Mic  For this cause he will give them up till the time when she who is with child has given birth then the rest of his brothers will come back to the children of Israel
Mic  And he will take his place and give food to his flock in the strength of the Lord in the glory of the name of the Lord his God and their restingplace will be safe for now he will be great to the ends of the earth
Mic  And this will be our peace when the Assyrian comes into our country and his feet are in our land then we will put up against him seven keepers of the flocks and eight chiefs among men
Mic  And they will make waste the land of Assyria with the sword and the land of Nimrod with the edge of the sword he will give us salvation from the Assyrian when he comes into our country when his feet come inside the limit of our land
Mic  And the rest of Jacob will be among the mass of peoples like dew from the Lord like showers on the grass which may not be kept back by man or be waiting for the sons of men
Mic  And the rest of Jacob will be among the nations in the middle of the mass of peoples like a lion among the beasts of the woods like a young lion among the flocks of sheep if he goes through they will be crushed under foot and pulled to bits and there will be no saviour
Mic  Your hand is lifted up against those who are against you and all your haters will be cut off
Mic  And it will come about in that day says the Lord that I will take away your horses from you and will give your warcarriages to destruction
Mic  I will have the towns of your land cut off and all your strong places pulled down
Mic  I will put an end to your use of secret arts and you will have no more readers of signs
Mic  And I will have your images and your pillars cut off from you and you will no longer give worship to the work of your hands
Mic  I will have your Asherahs pulled up from among you and I will send destruction on your images
Mic  And my punishment will be effected on the nations with such burning wrath as they have not had word of
Mic  Give ear now to the words of the Lord Up put forward your cause before the mountains let your voice be sounding among the hills
Mic  Give ear O you mountains to the Lords cause and take note you bases of the earth for the Lord has a cause against his people and he will take it up with Israel
Mic  O my people what have I done to you how have I been a weariness to you give answer against me
Mic  For I took you up out of the land of Egypt and made you free from the prisonhouse I sent before you Moses Aaron and Miriam
Mic  O my people keep in mind now what was designed by Balak king of Moab and the answer which Balaam son of Beor gave him the events from Shittim to Gilgal so that you may be certain of the upright acts of the Lord
Mic  With what am I to come before the Lord and go with bent head before the high God am I to come before him with burned offerings with young oxen a year old
Mic  Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of sheep or with ten thousand rivers of oil am I to give my first child for my wrongdoing the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul
Mic  He has made clear to you O man what is good and what is desired from you by the Lord only doing what is right and loving mercy and walking without pride before your God
Mic  The voice of the Lord is crying out to the town Give ear you tribes and the meeting of the town
Mic  Am I to let the stores of the evildoer go out of my memory and the short measure which is cursed
Mic  Is it possible for me to let wrong scales and the bag of false weights go without punishment
Mic  For its men of wealth are cruel and its people have said what is not true and their tongue is false in their mouth
Mic  So I have made a start with your punishment I have made you waste because of your sins
Mic  You will have food but not enough your shame will be ever with you you will get your goods moved but you will not take them away safely and what you do take away I will give to the sword
Mic  You will put in seed but you will not get in the grain you will be crushing olives but your bodies will not be rubbed with the oil and you will get in the grapes but you will have no wine
Mic  For you have kept the laws of Omri and all the works of the family of Ahab and you have been guided by their designs so that I might make you a cause of wonder and your people a cause of hisses and the shame of my people will be on you
Mic  Sorrow is mine for I am as when they have got in the summer fruits like the last of the grapes there is nothing for food not even an early fig for my desire
Mic  The good man is gone from the earth there is no one upright among men they are all waiting secretly for blood every man is going after his brother with a net
Mic  Their hands are made ready to do evil the ruler makes requests for money and the judge is looking for a reward and the great man gives decisions at his pleasure and the right is twisted
Mic  The best of them is like a waste plant and their upright ones are like a wall of thorns Sorrow the day of their fate has come now will trouble come on them
Mic  Put no faith in a friend do not let your hope be placed in a relation keep watch on the doors of your mouth against her who is resting on your breast
Mic  For the son puts shame on his father the daughter goes against her mother and the daughterinlaw against her motherinlaw and a mans haters are those of his family
Mic  But as for me I am looking to the Lord I am waiting for the God of my salvation the ears of my God will be open to me
Mic  Do not be glad because of my sorrow O my hater after my fall I will be lifted up when I am seated in the dark the Lord will be a light to me
Mic  I will undergo the wrath of the Lord because of my sin against him till he takes up my cause and does what is right for me when he makes me come out into the light I will see his righteousness
Mic  And my hater will see it and be covered with shame she who said to me Where is the Lord your God my eyes will see their desire effected on her now she will be crushed under foot like the dust of the streets
Mic  A day for building your walls in that day will your limits be stretched far and wide
Mic  In that day they will come to you from Assyria and the towns of Egypt and from Egypt even to the River and from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain
Mic  But the land will become a waste because of its people as the fruit of their works
Mic  Keep your people safe with your rod the flock of your heritage living by themselves in the woods in the middle of Carmel let them get their food in Bashan and Gilead as in the past
Mic  As in the days when you came out from the land of Egypt let us see things of wonder
Mic  The nations will see and be shamed because of all their strength they will put their hands on their mouths their ears will be stopped
Mic  They will take dust as their food like a snake like the things which go flat on the earth they will come shaking with fear out of their secret places they will come with fear to the Lord our God full of fear because of you
Mic  Who is a God like you offering forgiveness for evildoing and overlooking the sins of the rest of his heritage he does not keep his wrath for ever because his delight is in mercy
Mic  He will again have pity on us he will put our sins under his feet and you will send all our sins down into the heart of the sea
Mic  You will make clear your good faith to Jacob and your mercy to Abraham as you gave your oath to our fathers from times long past

Hab  The word which Habakkuk the prophet saw
Hab  How long O Lord will your ears be shut to my voice I make an outcry to you about violent behaviour but you do not send salvation
Hab  Why do you make me see evildoing and why are my eyes fixed on wrong for wasting and violent acts are before me and there is fighting and bitter argument
Hab  For this reason the law is feeble and decisions are not effected for the upright man is circled round by evildoers because of which right is twisted
Hab  See among the nations and take note and be full of wonder for in your days I am doing a work in which you will have no belief even if news of it is given to you
Hab  For see I am sending the Chaldaeans that bitter and quickmoving nation who go through the wide spaces of the earth to get for themselves livingplaces which are not theirs
Hab  They are greatly to be feared their right comes from themselves
Hab  And their horses are quicker than leopards and their horsemen more cruel than evening wolves they come from far away like an eagle in flight rushing on its food
Hab  They are coming all of them with force the direction of their faces is forward the number of their prisoners is like the sands of the sea
Hab  He makes little of kings rulers are a sport to him all the strong places are to be laughed at for he makes earthworks and takes them
Hab  Then his purpose will be changed overstepping the limit he will make his strength his god
Hab  Are you not eternal O Lord my God my Holy One for you there is no death O Lord he has been ordered by you for our punishment and by you O Rock he has been marked out to put us right
Hab  Before your holy eyes sin may not be seen and you are unable to put up with wrong why then are your eyes on the false why do you say nothing when the evildoer puts an end to one who is more upright than himself
Hab  He has made men like the fishes of the sea like the worms which have no ruler over them
Hab  He takes them all up with his hook he takes them in his net getting them together in his fishingnet for which cause he is glad and full of joy
Hab  For this reason he makes an offering to his net burning perfume to his fishingnet because by them he gets much food and his meat is fat
Hab  For this cause his net is ever open and there is no end to his destruction of the nations
Hab  I will take my position and be on watch placing myself on my tower looking out to see what he will say to me and what answer he will give to my protest
Hab  And the Lord gave me an answer and said Put the vision in writing and make it clear on stones so that the reader may go quickly
Hab  For the vision is still for the fixed time and it is moving quickly to the end and it will not be false even if it is slow in coming go on waiting for it because it will certainly come it will not be kept back
Hab  As for the man of pride my soul has no pleasure in him but the upright man will have life through his good faith
Hab  A curse on the cruel and false one the man full of pride who never has enough who makes his desires wide as the underworld he is like death he is never full but he makes all nations come to him getting all peoples together to himself
Hab  Will not all these take up a word of shame against him and a bitter saying against him and say A curse on him who goes on taking what is not his and is weighted down with the property of debtors
Hab  Will not your creditors suddenly be moved against you and your troublers get up from their sleep and you will be to them like goods taken in war
Hab  Because you have taken their goods from great nations all the rest of the peoples will take your goods from you because of mens blood and violent acts against the land and the town and all who are living in it
Hab  A curse on him who gets evil profits for his family so that he may put his restingplace on high and be safe from the hand of the wrongdoer
Hab  You have been a cause of shame to your house by cutting off a number of peoples and sinning against your soul
Hab  For the stone will give a cry out of the wall and it will be answered by the board out of the woodwork
Hab  A curse on him who is building a place with blood and basing a town on evildoing
Hab  See is it not the pleasure of the Lord of armies that the peoples are working for the fire and using themselves up for nothing
Hab  For the earth will be full of the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the sea is covered by the waters
Hab  A curse on him who gives his neighbour the wine of his wrath making him overcome with strong drink from the cup of his passion so that you may be a witness of their shame
Hab  You are full of shame in place of glory take your part in the drinking and let your shame be uncovered the cup of the Lords right hand will come round to you and your glory will be covered with shame
Hab  For the violent acts against Lebanon will come on you and the destruction of the cattle will be a cause of fear to you because of mens blood and the violent acts against the land and the town and all who are living in it
Hab  What profit is the pictured image to its maker and as for the metal image the false teacher why does its maker put his faith in it making false gods without a voice
Hab  A curse on him who says to the wood Awake to the unbreathing stone Up let it be a teacher See it is plated with gold and silver and there is no breath at all inside it
Hab  But the Lord is in his holy Temple let all the earth be quiet before him
Hab  A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet put to Shigionoth
Hab  O Lord word of you has come to my ears I have seen your work O Lord when the years come near make it clear in wrath keep mercy in mind
Hab  God came from Teman and the Holy One from Mount Paran Selah The heavens were covered with his glory and the earth was full of his praise
Hab  He was shining like the light he had rays coming out from his hand there his power was kept secret
Hab  Before him went disease and flames went out at his feet
Hab  From his high place he sent shaking on the earth he saw and nations were suddenly moved and the eternal mountains were broken the unchanging hills were bent down his ways are eternal
Hab  The curtains of Cushan were troubled and the tents of Midian were shaking
Hab  Was your wrath burning against the rivers were you angry with the sea that you went on your horses on your warcarriages of salvation
Hab  Your bow was quite uncovered Selah By you the earth was cut through with rivers
Hab  The mountains saw you and were moved with fear the clouds were streaming with water the voice of the deep was sounding the sun did not come up and the moon kept still in her place
Hab  At the light of your arrows they went away at the shining of your polished spear
Hab  You went stepping through the land in wrath crushing the nations in your passion
Hab  You went out for the salvation of your people for the salvation of the one on whom your holy oil was put wounding the head of the family of the evildoer uncovering the base even to the neck Selah
Hab  You have put your spears through his head his horsemen were sent in flight like dry stems they had joy in driving away the poor in making a meal of them secretly
Hab  The feet of your horses were on the sea on the mass of great waters
Hab  Hearing it my inner parts were moved and my lips were shaking at the sound my bones became feeble and my steps were uncertain under me I gave sounds of grief in the day of trouble when his forces came up against the people in bands
Hab  For though the figtree has no flowers and there is no fruit on the vine and work on the olive comes to nothing and the fields give no food and the flock is cut off from its restingplace and there is no herd in the cattlehouse
Hab  Still I will be glad in the Lord my joy will be in the God of my salvation
Hab  The Lord God is my strength and he makes my feet like roes feet guiding me on my high places For the chief musicmaker on corded instruments
Zep  The word of the Lord which came to Zephaniah the son of Cushi the son of Gedaliah the son of Amariah the son of Hezekiah in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah
Zep  I will take away everything from the face of the earth says the Lord
Zep  I will take away man and beast I will take away the birds of the heaven and the fishes of the sea causing the downfall of the evildoers and cutting man off from the face of the earth says the Lord
Zep  And my hand will be stretched out on Judah and on all the people of Jerusalem cutting off the name of the Baal from this place and the name of the false priests
Zep  And the worshippers of the army of heaven on the housetops and the Lords worshippers who take oaths by Milcom
Zep  And those who are turned back from going after the Lord and those who have not made prayer to the Lord or got directions from him
Zep  Let there be no sound before the Lord God for the day of the Lord is near for the Lord has made ready an offering he has made his guests holy
Zep  And it will come about in the day of the Lords offering that I will send punishment on the rulers and the kings sons and all who are clothed in robes from strange lands
Zep  And in that day I will send punishment on all those who come jumping over the doorstep and make their masters house full of violent behaviour and deceit
Zep  And in that day says the Lord there will be the sound of a cry from the fish doorway and an outcry from the new town and a great thundering from the hills and cries of grief from the people of the Hollow
Zep  Because of the downfall of all the people of Canaan all those who were weighted down with silver have been cut off
Zep  And it will come about at that time that I will go searching through Jerusalem with lights and I will send punishment on the men who have become like wine stored overlong who say to themselves The Lord will not do good and will not do evil
Zep  And their wealth will be violently taken away and their houses will be made waste they will go on building houses and never living in them and planting vinegardens but not drinking the wine from them
Zep  The great day of the Lord is near it is near and coming very quickly the bitter day of the Lord is near coming on more quickly than a man of war
Zep  That day is a day of wrath a day of trouble and sorrow a day of wasting and destruction a day of dark night and deep shade a day of cloud and thick dark
Zep  A day of sounding the horn and the warcry against the walled towns and the high towers
Zep  And I will send trouble on men so that they will go about like the blind because they have done evil against the Lord and their blood will be drained out like dust and their strength like waste
Zep  Even their silver and their gold will not be able to keep them safe in the day of the Lords wrath but all the land will be burned up in the fire of his bitter wrath for he will put an end even suddenly to all who are living in the land
Zep  Come together make everyone come together O nation without shame
Zep  Before the Lord sends you violently away in flight like the waste from the grain before the burning wrath of the Lord comes on you before the day of the Lords wrath comes on you
Zep  Make search for the Lord all you quiet ones of the earth who have done what is right in his eyes make search for righteousness and a quiet heart it may be that you will be safely covered in the day of the Lords wrath
Zep  For Gaza will be given up and Ashkelon will become waste they will send Ashdod out in the middle of the day and Ekron will be uprooted
Zep  Sorrow to the people living by the sea the nation of the Cherethites The word of the Lord is against you O Canaan the land of the Philistines I will send destruction on you till there is no one living in you
Zep  And the land by the sea will be grassland with houses for keepers of sheep and walled places for flocks
Zep  The land by the sea will be for the rest of the children of Judah by the sea they will give their flocks food in the houses of Ashkelon they will take their rest in the evening for the Lord their God will take them in hand and their fate will be changed
Zep  My ears have been open to the bitter words of Moab and the words of shame of the children of Ammon which they have said against my people lifting themselves up against the limit of their land
Zep  For this cause by my life says the Lord of armies the God of Israel truly Moab will become like Sodom and the children of Ammon like Gomorrah given up to waste plants and salt pools and unpeopled for ever the rest of my people will take their property the overflow of my nation will take their heritage
Zep  This will be their fate because of their pride because they have said evil lifting themselves up against the people of the Lord of armies
Zep  The Lord will let himself be seen by them for he will make all the gods of the earth feeble and men will go down before him in worship everyone from his place even all the sealands of the nations
Zep  And you Ethiopians will be put to death by my sword
Zep  And his hand will be stretched out against the north for the destruction of Assyria and he will make Nineveh unpeopled and dry like the waste land
Zep  And herds will take their rest in the middle of her all the beasts of the valley the pelican and the porcupine will make their livingplaces on the tops of its pillars the owl will be crying in the window the raven will be seen on the doorstep
Zep  This is the town which was full of joy living without fear of danger saying in her heart I am and there is no other how has she been made waste a place for beasts to take their rest in everyone who goes by her will make hisses waving his hand
Zep  Sorrow to her who is uncontrolled and unclean the cruel town
Zep  She gave no attention to the voice she had no use for teaching she put no faith in the Lord she did not come near to her God
Zep  Her rulers are like loudvoiced lions in her her judges are wolves of the evening crushing up the bones before the morning
Zep  Her prophets are goodfornothing persons full of deceit her priests have made the holy place unclean and have gone violently against the law
Zep  The Lord in her is upright he will not do evil every morning he lets his righteousness be seen he is unchanging but the evildoer has no sense of shame
Zep  I have had the nations cut off their towers are broken down I have made their streets a waste so that no one goes through them destruction has overtaken their towns so that there is no man living in them
Zep  I said Certainly you will go in fear of me and come under my training so that whatever I may send on her may not be cut off before her eyes but they got up early and made all their works evil
Zep  For this reason go on waiting for me says the Lord till the day when I come up as a witness for my purpose is to send for the nations and to get the kingdoms together so that I may let loose on them my passion even all my burning wrath for all the earth will be burned up in the fire of my bitter passion
Zep  For then I will give the people a clean language so that they may all make prayer to the Lord and be his servants with one mind
Zep  From over the rivers of Ethiopia and from the sides of the north they will come to me with an offering
Zep  In that day you will have no shame on account of all the things in which you did evil against me for then I will take away from among you those who were lifted up in pride and you will no longer be lifted up with pride in my holy mountain
Zep  But I will still have among you a quiet and poor people and they will put their faith in the name of the Lord
Zep  The rest of Israel will do no evil and say no false words the tongue of deceit will not be seen in their mouth for they will take their food and their rest and no one will be a cause of fear to them
Zep  Make melody O daughter of Zion give a loud cry O Israel be glad and let your heart be full of joy O daughter of Jerusalem
Zep  The Lord has taken away those who were judging you he has sent your haters far away the King of Israel even the Lord is among you you will have no more fear of evil
Zep  In that day it will be said to Jerusalem Have no fear O Zion let not your hands be feeble
Zep  The Lord your God is among you as a strong saviour he will be glad over you with joy he will make his love new again he will make a song of joy over you as in the time of a holy feast
Zep  I will take away your troubles lifting up your shame from off you
Zep  See at that time I will put an end to all who have been troubling you I will give salvation to her whose steps are uncertain and get together her who has been sent in flight and I will make them a cause of praise and an honoured name in all the earth when I let their fate be changed
Zep  At that time I will make you come in at that time I will get you together for I will make you a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth when I let your fate be changed before your eyes says the Lord
Hag  In the second year of Darius the king in the sixth month on the first day of the month came the word of the Lord by Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel ruler of Judah and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak the high priest saying
Hag  These are the words of the Lord of armies These people say The time has not come for building the Lords house
Hag  Then the word of the Lord came by Haggai the prophet saying
Hag  Is it a time for you to be living in roofed houses while this house is a waste
Hag  For this cause the Lord of armies has said Give thought to your ways
Hag  Much has been planted but little got in you take food but have not enough you take drink but are not full you are clothed but no one is warm and he who gets payment for his work gets it to put it into a bag full of holes
Hag  This is what the Lord of armies has said Give thought to your ways
Hag  Go up to the hills and get wood and put up the house and I will take pleasure in it and be honoured says the Lord
Hag  You were looking for much and it came to little and when you got it into your house I took it away with a breath Why says the Lord of armies Because of my house which is a waste while every man takes care of the house which is his
Hag  For this cause the heaven over you is kept from giving dew and the earth from giving her fruit
Hag  And by my order no rain came on the land or on the mountains or the grain or the wine or the oil or the produce of the earth or on men or cattle or on any work of mans hands
Hag  Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Joshua the son of Jehozadak the high priest and all the rest of the people gave ear to the voice of the Lord their God and to the words of Haggai the prophet because the Lord their God had sent him and the people were in fear before the Lord
Hag  Then Haggai whom the Lord had sent to give his words to the people said I am with you says the Lord
Hag  And the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel ruler of Judah was moved by the Lord as was the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak the high priest and the spirit of all the rest of the people and they came and did work in the house of the Lord of armies their God
Hag  On the twentyfourth day of the month in the sixth month in the second year of Darius the king
Hag  In the seventh month on the twentyfirst day of the month the word of the Lord came by Haggai the prophet saying
Hag  Say now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel ruler of Judah and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak the high priest and to the rest of the people
Hag  Who is there still among you who saw this house in its first glory and how do you see it now is it not in your eyes as nothing
Hag  But now be strong O Zerubbabel says the Lord and be strong O Joshua son of Jehozadak the high priest and be strong all you people of the land says the Lord and get to work for I am with you says the Lord of armies
Hag  The agreement which I made with you when you came out of Egypt and my spirit are with you still have no fear
Hag  For this is what the Lord of armies has said In a short time I will make a shaking of the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land
Hag  And I will make a shaking of all the nations and the desired things of all nations will come and I will make this house full of my glory says the Lord of armies
Hag  The silver is mine and the gold is mine says the Lord of armies
Hag  The second glory of this house will be greater than the first says the Lord of armies and in this place I will give peace says the Lord of armies
Hag  On the twentyfourth day of the ninth month in the second year of Darius the word of the Lord came by Haggai the prophet saying
Hag  These are the words of the Lord of armies Put now a point of law to the priests saying
Hag  If anyone has some holy flesh folded in the skirt of his robe will bread or soup or wine or oil or any other food be made holy if touched by his skirt And the priests answering said No
Hag  Then Haggai said Will any of these be made unclean by the touch of one who is unclean through touching a dead body And the priests answering said It will be made unclean
Hag  Then Haggai said So is this people and so is this nation before me says the Lord and so is every work of their hands and the offering they give there is unclean
Hag  And now give thought looking back from this day to the time before one stone was put on another in the Temple of the Lord
Hag  How when anyone came to a store of twenty measures there were only ten when anyone went to the winestore to get fifty vessels full there were only twenty
Hag  And I sent burning and wasting and a rain of icedrops on all the works of your hands but still you were not turned to me says the Lord
Hag  And now give thought looking on from this day from the twentyfourth day of the ninth month from the time when the base of the Lords house was put in its place give thought to it
Hag  Is the seed still in the storehouse have the vine and the figtree the pomegranate and the olivetree still not given their fruit from this day I will send my blessing on you
Hag  And the word of the Lord came a second time to Haggai on the twentyfourth day of the month saying
Hag  Say to Zerubbabel ruler of Judah I will make a shaking of the heavens and the earth
Hag  Overturning the power of kingdoms and I will send destruction on the strength of the kingdoms of the nations by me warcarriages will be overturned with those who are in them and the horses and the horsemen will come down everyone by the sword of his brother
Hag  In that day says the Lord of armies I will take you O Zerubbabel my servant the son of Shealtiel says the Lord and will make you as a jewelled ring for I have taken you to be mine says the Lord of armies
Zec  In the eighth month in the second year of Darius the word of the Lord came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah the son of Iddo the prophet saying
Zec  The Lord has been very angry with your fathers
Zec  And you are to say to them These are the words of the Lord of armies Come back to me says the Lord of armies and I will come back to you
Zec  Be not like your fathers to whom the voice of the earlier prophets came saying Be turned now from your evil ways and from your evil doings but they did not give ear to me or take note says the Lord
Zec  Your fathers where are they and the prophets do they go on living for ever
Zec  But my words and my orders which I gave to my servants the prophets have they not overtaken your fathers and turning back they said As it was the purpose of the Lord of armies to do to us in reward for our ways and our doings so has he done
Zec  On the twentyfourth day of the eleventh month the month Shebat in the second year of Darius the word of the Lord came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah the son of Iddo the prophet saying
Zec  I saw in the night a man on a red horse between the mountains in the valley and at his back were horses red black white and of mixed colours
Zec  Then I said O my lord what are these And the angel who was talking to me said to me I will make clear to you what they are
Zec  And the man who was between the mountains answering me said These are those whom the Lord has sent to go up and down through the earth
Zec  And the man who was between the mountains answering said to the angel of the Lord We have gone up and down through the earth and all the earth is quiet and at rest
Zec  Then the angel of the Lord answering said O Lord of armies how long will it be before you have mercy on Jerusalem and on the towns of Judah against which your wrath has been burning for seventy years
Zec  And the Lord gave an answer in good and comforting words to the angel who was talking to me
Zec  And the angel who was talking to me said to me Let your voice be loud and say These are the words of the Lord of armies I am greatly moved about the fate of Jerusalem and of Zion
Zec  And I am very angry with the nations who are living untroubled for when I was only a little angry they made the evil worse
Zec  So this is what the Lord has said I have come back to Jerusalem with mercies my house is to be put up in her says the Lord of armies and a line is to be stretched out over Jerusalem
Zec  And again let your voice be loud and say This is what the Lord of armies has said My towns will again be overflowing with good things and again the Lord will give comfort to Zion and take Jerusalem for himself
Zec  And lifting up my eyes I saw four horns
Zec  And I said to the angel who was talking to me What are these And he said to me These are the horns which have sent Judah Israel and Jerusalem in flight
Zec  And the Lord gave me a vision of four metalworkers
Zec  Then I said What have these come to do And he said These are the horns which sent Judah in flight and kept him from lifting up his head but these men have come to send fear on them and to put down the nations who are lifting up their horns against the land of Judah to send it in flight
Zec  And lifting up my eyes I saw a man with a measuringline in his hand
Zec  And I said to him Where are you going And he said to me To take the measure of Jerusalem to see how wide and how long it is
Zec  And the angel who was talking to me went out and another angel went out and meeting him
Zec  Said to him Go quickly and say to this young man Jerusalem will be an unwalled town because of the great number of men and cattle in her
Zec  For I says the Lord will be a wall of fire round about her and I will be the glory inside her
Zec  Ho ho go in flight from the land of the north says the Lord for I have sent you far and wide to the four winds of heaven says the Lord
Zec  Ho Zion go in flight from danger you who are living with the daughter of Babylon
Zec  For this is what the Lord of armies has said In the way of glory he has sent me to the nations which have taken your goods for anyone touching you is touching what is most dear to him
Zec  For at the shaking of my hand over them their goods will be taken by those who were their servants and you will see that the Lord of armies has sent me
Zec  Give songs of joy O daughter of Zion for I come and I will make my restingplace among you says the Lord
Zec  And a number of nations will be joined to the Lord in that day and will become my people and I will be living among you and you will see that the Lord of armies has sent me to you
Zec  And Judah will be the Lords heritage in the holy land and Jerusalem will again be his
Zec  Let all flesh be quiet and make no sound before the Lord for he is awake and has come from his holy restingplace
Zec  And he let me see Joshua the high priest in his place before the angel of the Lord and the Satan at his right hand ready to take up a cause against him
Zec  And the Lord said to the Satan May the Lords word be sharp against you O Satan the word of the Lord who has taken Jerusalem for himself is this not a burning branch pulled out of the fire
Zec  Now Joshua was clothed in unclean robes and he was in his place before the angel
Zec  And he made answer and said to those who were there before him Take the unclean robes off him and let him be clothed in clean robes
Zec  And let them put a clean headdress on his head So they put a clean headdress on his head clothing him with clean robes and to him he said See I have taken your sin away from you
Zec  And the angel of the Lord made a statement to Joshua and said
Zec  These are the words of the Lord of armies If you will go in my ways and keep what I have put in your care then you will be judge over my Temple and have the care of my house and I will give you the right to come in among those who are there
Zec  Give ear now O Joshua the high priest you and your friends who are seated before you for these are men who are a sign for see I will let my servant the Branch be seen
Zec  For see the stone which I have put before Joshua on one stone are seven eyes see the design cut on it will be my work says the Lord of armies and I will take away the sin of that land in one day
Zec  In that day says the Lord of armies you will be one anothers guests under the vine and under the figtree
Zec  And the angel who was talking to me came again awaking me as a man out of his sleep
Zec  And he said to me What do you see And I said I see a lightsupport made all of gold with its cup on the top of it and seven lights on it and there are seven pipes to every one of the lights which are on the top of it
Zec  And two olivetrees by it one on the right side of the cup and one on the left
Zec  And I made answer and said to the angel who was talking to me What are these my lord
Zec  Then the angel who was talking to me answering me said Have you no knowledge of what these are And I said No my lord
Zec  This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel saying Not by force or by power but by my spirit says the Lord of armies
Zec  Who are you O great mountain before Zerubbabel you will become level and he will let all see the headstone with cries of Grace grace to it
Zec  Then the word of the Lord came to me saying
Zec  The hands of Zerubbabel have put the base of this house in place and his hands will make it complete and it will be clear to you that the Lord of armies has sent me to you
Zec  For who has had a poor opinion of the day of small things for they will be glad when they see the weighted measuringline in the hand of Zerubbabel Then he said in answer to me These seven lights are the eyes of the Lord which go quickly up and down through all the earth
Zec  And I made answer and said to him What are these two olivetrees on the right side of the lightsupport and on the left
Zec  And answering a second time I said to him What are these two olive branches through whose gold pipes the oil is drained out
Zec  And he said in answer to me Have you no knowledge what these are And I said No my lord
Zec  And he said These are the two sons of oil whose place is by the Lord of all the earth
Zec  Then again lifting up my eyes I saw a roll in flight through the air
Zec  And he said to me What do you see And I said A roll going through the air it is twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide
Zec  Then he said to me This is the curse which goes out over the face of all the land for long enough has every thief gone without punishment and long enough has every taker of false oaths gone without punishment
Zec  And I will send it out says the Lord of armies and it will go into the house of the thief and into the house of him who takes a false oath by my name and it will be in his house causing its complete destruction with its woodwork and its stones
Zec  And the angel who was talking to me went out and said to me Let your eyes be lifted up now and see the ephah which is going out
Zec  And I said What is it And he said This is an ephah which is going out And he said further This is their evildoing in all the land
Zec  And I saw a round cover of lead lifted up and a woman was seated in the middle of the ephah
Zec  And he said This is Sin and pushing her down into the ephah he put the weight of lead on the mouth of it
Zec  And lifting up my eyes I saw two women coming out and the wind was in their wings and they had wings like the wings of a stork and they took the ephah lifting it up between earth and heaven
Zec  And I said to the angel who was talking to me Where are they taking the ephah
Zec  And he said to me To make a house for her in the land of Shinar and they will make a place ready and put her there in the place which is hers
Zec  And again lifting up my eyes I saw four warcarriages coming out from between the two mountains and the mountains were mountains of brass
Zec  In the first warcarriage were red horses and in the second black horses
Zec  And in the third white horses and in the fourth horses of mixed colour
Zec  And I made answer and said to the angel who was talking to me What are these my lord
Zec  And the angel answering said to me These go out to the four winds of heaven from their place before the Lord of all the earth
Zec  The carriage in which are the black horses goes in the direction of the north country the white go to the west and those of mixed colour go in the direction of the south country
Zec  And the red ones go to the east and they made request that they might go up and down through the earth and he said Go up and down through the earth So they went up and down through the earth
Zec  Then crying out to me he said See those who are going to the north country have given rest to the spirit of the Lord in the north country
Zec  And the word of the Lord came to me saying
Zec  Take the offerings of those who went away as prisoners from Heldai Tobijah and Jedaiah and from the family of Josiah the son of Zephaniah who have come from Babylon
Zec  And take silver and gold and make a crown and put it on the head of Zerubbabel
Zec  And say to him These are the words of the Lord of armies See the man whose name is the Branch under whom there will be fertile growth
Zec  And he will be the builder of the Temple of the Lord and the glory will be his and he will take his place as ruler on the seat of power and Joshua will be a priest at his right hand and between them there will be a design of peace
Zec  And the crown will be for grace to Heldai and Tobijah and Jedaiah and the son of Zephaniah to keep their memory living in the house of the Lord
Zec  And those who are far away will come and be builders in the Temple of the Lord and it will be clear to you that the Lord of armies has sent me to you
Zec  And it came about in the fourth year of King Darius that the word of the Lord came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month the month Chislev
Zec  Now they of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech to make a request for grace from the Lord
Zec  And to say to the priests of the house of the Lord of armies and to the prophets Am I to go on weeping in the fifth month separating myself as I have done in past years
Zec  Then the word of the Lord of armies came to me saying
Zec  Say to all the people of the land and to the priests When you went without food and gave yourselves to grief in the fifth and the seventh months for these seventy years did you ever do it because of me
Zec  And when you are feasting and drinking are you not doing it only for yourselves
Zec  Are not these the words which the Lord said to you by the earlier prophets when Jerusalem was full of people and wealth and the towns round about her and the South and the Lowland were peopled
Zec  And the word of the Lord came to Zechariah saying
Zec  This is what the Lord of armies has said Let your judging be upright and done in good faith let every man have mercy and pity for his brother
Zec  Do not be hard on the widow or the child without a father on the man from a strange country or on the poor let there be no evil thought in your heart against your brother
Zec  But they would not give attention turning their backs and stopping their ears from hearing
Zec  And they made their hearts like the hardest stone so that they might not give ear to the law and the words which the Lord of armies had said by the earlier prophets and there came great wrath from the Lord of armies
Zec  And it came about that as they would not give ear to his voice so I would not give ear to their voice says the Lord of armies
Zec  But with a stormwind I sent them in flight among all the nations of whom they had no knowledge So the land was waste after them so that no man went through or came back for they had made waste the desired land
Zec  And the word of the Lord of armies came to me saying
Zec  These are the words of the Lord of armies I am angry about the fate of Zion I am angry about her with great wrath
Zec  This is what the Lord has said I have come back to Zion and will make my livingplace in Jerusalem and Jerusalem will be named The town of good faith and the mountain of the Lord of armies The holy mountain
Zec  This is what the Lord of armies has said There will again be old men and old women seated in the open spaces of Jerusalem every man with his stick in his hand because he is so old
Zec  And the open spaces of the town will be full of boys and girls playing in its open spaces
Zec  This is what the Lord of armies has said If this is a wonder to the rest of this people is it a wonder to me says the Lord of armies
Zec  This is what the Lord of armies has said See I will be the saviour of my people from the east country and from the west country
Zec  And I will make them come and be living in Jerusalem and they will be to me a people and I will be to them a God in good faith and in righteousness
Zec  This is what the Lord of armies has said Let your hands be strong you who are now hearing these words from the mouths of the prophets that is to say in the days when the base of the house of the Lord of armies has been put in place for the building of the house that is the Temple
Zec  For before those days there was no payment for a mans work or for the use of a beast and there was no peace for him who went out or him who came in because of the attacker for I had every man turned against his neighbour
Zec  But now I will not be to the rest of this people as I was in the past says the Lord of armies
Zec  For I will let the seed of peace be planted the vine will give her fruit and the land will give her increase and the heavens will give their dew and I will give to the rest of this people all these things for their heritage
Zec  And it will come about that as you were a curse among the nations O children of Judah and children of Israel so I will give you salvation and you will be a blessing have no fear and let your hands be strong
Zec  For this is what the Lord of armies has said As it was my purpose to do evil to you when your fathers made me angry says the Lord of armies and my purpose was not changed
Zec  So in these days it is again my purpose to do good to Jerusalem and to the children of Judah have no fear
Zec  These are the things which you are to do Let every man say what is true to his neighbour and let your judging give peace in your towns
Zec  Let no one have any evil thought in his heart against his neighbour and have no love for false oaths for all these things are hated by me says the Lord
Zec  And the word of the Lord of armies came to me saying
Zec  This is what the Lord of armies has said The times of going without food in the fourth month and in the fifth and the seventh and the tenth months will be for the people of Judah times of joy and happy meetings so be lovers of good faith and of peace
Zec  This is what the Lord of armies has said It will again come about that when peoples and those living in great towns come
Zec  And the people of one town go to another and say Let us certainly go with a request for grace from the Lord and to give worship to the Lord of armies then I will go with you
Zec  And great peoples and strong nations will come to give worship to the Lord of armies in Jerusalem and to make requests for grace from the Lord
Zec  This is what the Lord of armies has said In those days ten men from all the languages of the nations will put out their hands and take a grip of the skirt of him who is a Jew saying We will go with you for it has come to our ears that God is with you
Zec  A word of the Lord The Lord has come to the land of Hadrach and Damascus is his restingplace for the towns of Aram are the Lords
Zec  As well as Hamath which is by its limit and Tyre and Zidon because they are very wise
Zec  And Tyre made for herself a strong place and got together silver like dust and the best gold like the earth of the streets
Zec  See the Lord will take away her heritage overturning her power in the sea and she will be burned up with fire
Zec  Ashkelon will see it with fear and Gaza bent with pain and Ekron for her hope will be shamed and the king will be cut off from Gaza and Ashkelon will be unpeopled
Zec  And a mixed people will be living in Ashdod and I will have the pride of the Philistines cut off
Zec  And I will take away his blood from his mouth and his disgusting things from between his teeth and some of his people will be kept for our God and he will be as a family in Judah and Ekron as one living in Jerusalem
Zec  And I will put my forces in position round my house so that there may be no coming and going and no cruel master will again go through them for now I have seen his trouble
Zec  Be full of joy O daughter of Zion give a glad cry O daughter of Jerusalem see your king comes to you he is upright and has overcome gentle and seated on an ass on a young ass
Zec  And he will have the warcarriage cut off from Ephraim and the horse from Jerusalem and the bow of war will be cut off and he will say words of peace to the nations and his rule will be from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth
Zec  And as for you because of the blood of your agreement I have sent out your prisoners from the deep hole in which there is no water
Zec  And they will come back to you O daughter of Zion as prisoners of hope today I say to you that I will give you back twice as much
Zec  For I have made Judah a bow bent for my use I have made Ephraim the arrows of the bow I will make your sons O Zion take up arms against your sons O Greece and will make you like the sword of a man of war
Zec  And the Lord will be seen over them and his arrow will go out like the thunderflame and the Lord God sounding the warhorn will go in the stormwinds of the South
Zec  The Lord of armies will be a cover for them and they will overcome crushing under foot the armed men they will take their blood for drink like wine they will be full like the sides of the altar
Zec  And the Lord their God will be their saviour in that day giving them food like the flock of his people for they will be like the jewels of a crown shining over his land
Zec  For how good it is and how beautiful grain will make the young men strong and new wine the virgins
Zec  Make your request to the Lord for rain in the time of the spring rains even to the Lord who makes the thunderflames and he will give them showers of rain to every man grass in the field
Zec  For the images have said what is not true and the readers of signs have seen deceit they have given accounts of false dreams they give comfort to no purpose so they go out of the way like sheep they are troubled because they have no keeper
Zec  My wrath is burning against the keepers of the flock and I will send punishment on the hegoats for the Lord of armies takes care of his flock the people of Judah and will make them like the horse of his pride in the fight
Zec  From him will come the keystone from him the nail from him the bow of war from him will come every ruler
Zec  Together they will be like men of war crushing down their haters into the earth of the streets in the fight they will make war because the Lord is with them and the horsemen will be shamed
Zec  And I will make the children of Judah strong and I will be the saviour of the children of Joseph and I will make them come back again for I have had mercy on them they will be as if I had not given them up for I am the Lord their God and I will give them an answer
Zec  And Ephraim will be like a man of war and their hearts will be glad as with wine and their children will see it with joy their hearts will be glad in the Lord
Zec  With the sound of the pipe I will get them together for I have given the price to make them free and they will be increased as they were increased
Zec  Though I had them planted among the peoples they will keep me in mind in far countries and they will take care of their children and will come back
Zec  And I will make them come back out of the land of Egypt and will get them together out of Assyria and I will take them into the land of Gilead and it will not be wide enough for them
Zec  And they will go through the sea of Egypt and all the deep waters of the Nile will become dry and the pride of Assyria will be made low and the power of Egypt will be taken away
Zec  And their strength will be in the Lord and their pride will be in his name says the Lord
Zec  Let your doors be open O Lebanon so that fire may be burning among your cedars
Zec  Give a cry of grief O firtree for the fall of the cedar because the great ones have been made low give cries of grief O you oaks of Bashan for the strong trees of the wood have come down
Zec  The sound of the crying of the keepers of the flock for their glory is made waste the sound of the loud crying of the young lions for the pride of Jordan is made waste
Zec  This is what the Lord my God has said Take care of the flock of death
Zec  Whose owners put them to death and have no sense of sin and those who get a price for them say May the Lord be praised for I have much wealth and the keepers of the flock have no pity for them
Zec  For I will have no more pity for the people of the land says the Lord but I will give up everyone into his neighbours hand and into the hand of his king and they will make the land waste and I will not keep them safe from their hands
Zec  So I took care of the flock of death for those who made profit out of the flock and I took for myself two rods naming one Beautiful and the other Bands and I took care of the flock
Zec  And in one month I put an end to the three keepers of the flock for my soul was tired of them and their souls were disgusted with me
Zec  And I said I will not take care of you If death comes to any let death be its fate if any is cut off let it be cut off and let the rest take one anothers flesh for food
Zec  And I took my rod Beautiful cutting it in two so that the Lords agreement which he had made with all the peoples might be broken
Zec  And it was broken on that day and the sheeptraders who were watching me were certain that it was the word of the Lord
Zec  And I said to them If it seems good to you give me my payment and if not do not give it So they gave me my payment by weight thirty shekels of silver
Zec  And the Lord said to me Put it into the storehouse the price at which I was valued by them And I took the thirty shekels of silver and put them into the storehouse in the house of the Lord
Zec  Then I took my other rod the one named Bands cutting it in two so that the relation of brothers between Judah and Israel might be broken
Zec  And the Lord said to me Take again the instruments of a foolish keeper of sheep
Zec  For see I will put a sheepkeeper over the land who will have no care for that which is cut off and will not go in search of the wanderers or make well what is broken and he will not give food to that which is ill but he will take for his food the flesh of the fat and let their feet be broken
Zec  A curse on the foolish keeper who goes away from the flock the sword will be on his arm and on his right eye his arm will become quite dry and his eye will be made completely dark
Zec  The word of the Lord about Israel The Lord by whom the heavens are stretched out and the bases of the earth put in place and the spirit of man formed inside him has said
Zec  See I will make Jerusalem a cup of shaking fear to all the peoples round about when Jerusalem is shut in
Zec  And it will come about in that day that I will make Jerusalem a stone of great weight for all the peoples all those who take it up will be badly wounded and all the nations of the earth will come together against it
Zec  In that day says the Lord I will put fear into every horse and make every horseman go off his head and my eyes will be open on the people of Judah and I will make every horse of the peoples blind
Zec  And the families of Judah will say in their hearts The people of Jerusalem have their strength in the Lord of armies their God
Zec  In that day I will make the families of Judah like a pot with fire in it among trees and like a flaming stick among cut grain they will send destruction on all the peoples round about on the right hand and on the left and Jerusalem will be living again in the place which is hers that is in Jerusalem
Zec  And the Lord will give salvation to the tents of Judah first so that the glory of the family of David and the glory of the people of Jerusalem may not be greater than that of Judah
Zec  In that day the Lord will be a cover over the people of Jerusalem and he who is feeble among them in that day will be as strong as David and the family of David will be as God as the angel of the Lord before them
Zec  And it will come about on that day that I will take in hand the destruction of all the nations who come against Jerusalem
Zec  And I will send down on the family of David and on the people of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and of prayer and their eyes will be turned to the one who was wounded by their hands and they will be weeping for him as for an only son and their grief for him will be bitter like the grief of one sorrowing for his oldest son
Zec  In that day there will be a great weeping in Jerusalem like the weeping of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon
Zec  And the land will give itself to weeping every family separately the family of David by themselves and their wives by themselves the family of Nathan by themselves and their wives by themselves
Zec  The family of Levi by themselves and their wives by themselves the family of Shimei by themselves and their wives by themselves
Zec  And all the other families by themselves and their wives by themselves
Zec  In that day there will be a fountain open to the family of David and to the people of Jerusalem for sin and for that which is unclean
Zec  And it will come about on that day says the Lord of armies that I will have the names of the images cut off out of the land and there will be no more memory of them and I will send all the prophets and the unclean spirit away from the land
Zec  And if anyone goes on acting as a prophet then his father and his mother who gave him life will say to him You may not go on living for you are saying what is false in the name of the Lord and his father and his mother will put a sword through him when he does so
Zec  And it will come about in that day that the prophets will be shamed every man on account of his vision when he is talking as a prophet and they will not put on a robe of hair for purposes of deceit
Zec  But he will say I am no prophet but a worker on the land for I have been an owner of land from the time when I was young
Zec  And if anyone says to him What are these wounds between your hands then he will say Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends
Zec  Awake O sword against the keeper of my flock and against him who is with me says the Lord of armies put to death the keeper of the sheep and the sheep will go in flight and my hand will be turned against the little ones
Zec  And it will come about that in all the land says the Lord two parts of it will be cut off and come to an end but the third will be still living there
Zec  And I will make the third part go through the fire cleaning them as silver is made clean and testing them as gold is tested and they will make their prayer to me and I will give them an answer I will say It is my people and they will say The Lord is my God
Zec  See a day of the Lord is coming when they will make division of your goods taken by force before your eyes
Zec  For I will get all the nations together to make war against Jerusalem and the town will be overcome and the goods taken from the houses and the women taken by force and half the town will go away as prisoners and the rest of the people will not be cut off from the town
Zec  Then the Lord will go out and make war against those nations as he did in the day of the fight
Zec  And in that day his feet will be on the Mount of Olives which is opposite Jerusalem on the east and the Mount of Olives will be parted in the middle to the east and to the west forming a very great valley and half the mountain will be moved to the north and half of it to the south
Zec  And the valley will be stopped  and you will go in flight as you went in flight from the earthshock in the days of Uzziah king of Judah and the Lord my God will come and all his holy ones with him
Zec  And in that day there will be no heat or cold or ice
Zec  And it will be unbroken day such as the Lord has knowledge of without change of day and night and even at nightfall it will be light
Zec  And on that day living waters will go out from Jerusalem half of them flowing to the sea on the east and half to the sea on the west in summer and in winter it will be so
Zec  And the Lord will be King over all the earth in that day there will be one Lord and his name one
Zec  And all the land will become like the Arabah from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem and she will be lifted up and be living in her place from the doorway of Benjamin to the place of the first doorway to the doorway of the angle and from the tower of Hananel to the kings winecrushing places men will be living in her
Zec  And there will be no more curse but Jerusalem will be living without fear of danger
Zec  And this will be the disease which the Lord will send on all the peoples which have been warring against Jerusalem their flesh will be wasted away while they are on their feet their eyes will be wasted in their heads and their tongues in their mouths
Zec  And it will be on that day that a great fear will be sent among them from the Lord and everyone will take his neighbours hand and every mans hand will be lifted against his neighbours
Zec  And even Judah will be fighting against Jerusalem and the wealth of all the nations round about will be massed together a great store of gold and silver and clothing
Zec  And the horses and the transport beasts the camels and the asses and all the beasts in those tents will be attacked by the same disease
Zec  And it will come about that everyone who is still living of all those nations who came against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to give worship to the King the Lord of armies and to keep the feast of tents
Zec  And it will be that if any one of all the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to give worship to the King the Lord of armies on them there will be no rain
Zec  And if the family of Egypt does not go up or come there they will be attacked by the disease which the Lord will send on the nations
Zec  This will be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to keep the feast of tents
Zec  On that day all the bells of the horses will be holy to the Lord and the pots in the Lords house will be like the basins before the altar
Zec  And every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the Lord of armies and all those who make offerings will come and take them for boiling their offerings in that day there will be no more traders in the house of the Lord of armies
Mal  The word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi
Mal  You have been loved by me says the Lord But you say Where was your love for us Was not Esau Jacobs brother says the Lord but Jacob was loved by me
Mal  And Esau was hated and I sent destruction on his mountains and gave his heritage to the beasts of the waste land
Mal  Though Edom says We are crushed down but we will come back building up the waste places this is what the Lord of armies has said They may put up buildings but I will have them pulled down and they will be named The land of evildoing and The people against whom the Lord keeps his wrath for ever
Mal  And your eyes will see it and you will say The Lord is great even outside the limits of Israel
Mal  A son gives honour to his father and a servant has fear of his master if then I am a father where is my honour and if I am a master where is the fear of me says the Lord of armies to you O priests who give no value to my name And you say How have we not given value to your name
Mal  You put unclean bread on my altar And you say How have we made it unclean By your saying The table of the Lord is of no value
Mal  And when you give what is blind for an offering it is no evil and when you give what is damaged and ill it is no evil Give it now to your ruler will he be pleased with you or will you have his approval says the Lord of armies
Mal  And now make request for the grace of God so that he may have mercy on us this has been your doing will he give his approval to any of you says the Lord of armies
Mal  If only there was one among you who would see that the doors were shut so that you might not put a light to the fire on my altar for nothing I have no pleasure in you says the Lord of armies and I will not take an offering from your hands
Mal  For from the coming up of the sun till its going down my name is great among the Gentiles and in every place the smell of burning flesh is offered to my name and a clean offering for my name is great among the Gentiles says the Lord of armies
Mal  But you make it unholy by saying The Lords table has become unclean and his food is of no value
Mal  And you say See what a weariness it is and you let out your breath at it says the Lord of armies and you have given what has been cut about by beasts and what is damaged in its feet and ill this is the offering you give will this be pleasing to me from your hands says the Lord
Mal  A curse on the false man who has a male in his flock and takes his oath and gives to the Lord a damaged thing for I am a great King says the Lord of armies and my name is to be feared among the Gentiles
Mal  And now O you priests this order is for you
Mal  If you will not give ear and take it to heart to give glory to my name says the Lord of armies then I will send the curse on you and will put a curse on your blessing truly even now I have put a curse on it because you do not take it to heart
Mal  See I will have your arm cut off and will put waste on your faces even the waste from your feasts and you will be taken away with it
Mal  And you will be certain that I have sent this order to you so that it might be my agreement with Levi says the Lord of armies
Mal  My agreement with him was on my side life and peace and I gave them to him on his side fear and he had fear of me and gave honour to my name
Mal  True teaching was in his mouth and no evil was seen on his lips he was walking with me in peace and righteousness turning numbers of people away from evildoing
Mal  For it is right for the priests lips to keep knowledge and for men to be waiting for the law from his mouth for he is the servant sent from the Lord of armies
Mal  But you are turned out of the way you have made the law hard for numbers of people you have made the agreement of Levi of no value says the Lord of armies
Mal  And so I have taken away your honour and made you low before all the people even as you have not kept my ways and have given no thought to me in using the law
Mal  Have we not all one father has not one God made us why are we every one of us acting falsely to his brother putting shame on the agreement of our fathers
Mal  Judah has been acting falsely and a disgusting thing has been done in Jerusalem for Judah has made unclean the holy place of the Lord which is dear to him and has taken as his wife the daughter of a strange god
Mal  The Lord will have the man who does this cut off root and branch out of the tents of Jacob and him who makes an offering to the Lord of armies
Mal  And this again you do covering the altar of the Lord with weeping and with grief so that he gives no more thought to the offering and does not take it with pleasure from your hand
Mal  But you say For what reason Because the Lord has been a witness between you and the wife of your early years to whom you have been untrue though she is your friend and the wife to whom you have given your word
Mal   So give thought to your spirit and let no one be false to the wife of his early years
Mal  For I am against the putting away of a wife says the Lord the God of Israel and against him who is clothed with violent acts says the Lord of armies so give thought to your spirit and do not be false in your acts
Mal  You have made the Lord tired with your words And still you say How have we made him tired By your saying Everyone who does evil is good in the eyes of the Lord and he has delight in them or Where is God the judge
Mal  See I am sending my servant and he will make ready the way before me and the Lord whom you are looking for will suddenly come to his Temple and the angel of the agreement in whom you have delight see he is coming says the Lord of armies
Mal  But by whom may the day of his coming be faced and who may keep his place when he is seen for he is like the metaltesters fire and the cleaners soap
Mal  He will take his seat testing and cleaning the sons of Levi burning away the evil from them as from gold and silver so that they may make offerings to the Lord in righteousness
Mal  Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the Lord as in days gone by and as in past years
Mal  And I will come near to you for judging I will quickly be a witness against the wonderworkers against those who have been untrue in married life against those who take false oaths against those who keep back from the servant his payment and who are hard on the widow and the child without a father who do not give his rights to the man from a strange country and have no fear of me says the Lord of armies
Mal  For I am the Lord I am unchanged and so you O sons of Jacob have not been cut off
Mal  From the days of your fathers you have been turned away from my rules and have not kept them Come back to me and I will come back to you says the Lord of armies But you say How are we to come back
Mal  Will a man keep back from God what is right But you have kept back what is mine But you say What have we kept back from you Tenths and offerings
Mal  You are cursed with a curse for you have kept back from me what is mine even all this nation
Mal  Let your tenths come into the storehouse so that there may be food in my house and put me to the test by doing so says the Lord of armies and see if I do not make the windows of heaven open and send down such a blessing on you that there is no room for it
Mal  And on your account I will keep back the locusts from wasting the fruits of your land and the fruit of your vine will not be dropped on the field before its time says the Lord of armies
Mal  And you will be named happy by all nations for you will be a land of delight says the Lord of armies
Mal  Your words have been strong against me says the Lord And still you say What have we said against you
Mal  You have said It is no use worshipping God what profit have we had from keeping his orders and going in clothing of sorrow before the Lord of armies
Mal  And now to us the men of pride seem happy yes the evildoers are doing well they put God to the test and are safe
Mal  Then those in whom was the fear of the Lord had talk together and the Lord gave ear and it was recorded in a book to be kept in mind before him for those who had the fear of the Lord and gave thought to his name
Mal  And they will be mine says the Lord in the day when I make them my special property and I will have mercy on them as a man has mercy on his son who is his servant
Mal  Then you will again see how the upright man is different from the sinner and the servant of God from him who is not
Mal  For see the day is coming it is burning like an oven all the men of pride and all who do evil will be dry stems of grass and in the day which is coming they will be burned up says the Lord of armies till they have not a root or a branch
Mal  But to you who give worship to my name the sun of righteousness will come up with new life in its wings and you will go out playing like young oxen full of food
Mal  And the evildoers will be crushed under you they will be dust under your feet in the day when I do my work says the Lord of armies
Mal  Keep in mind the law of Moses my servant which I gave him in Horeb for all Israel even the rules and the decisions
Mal  See I am sending you Elijah the prophet before the day of the Lord comes that great day greatly to be feared
Mal  And by him the hearts of fathers will be turned to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers for fear that I may come and put the earth under a curse
