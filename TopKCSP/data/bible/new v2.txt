Mat  The book of the generations of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham
Mat  The son of Abraham was Isaac and the son of Isaac was Jacob and the sons of Jacob were Judah and his brothers
Mat  And the sons of Judah were Perez and Zerah by Tamar and the son of Perez was Hezron and the son of Hezron was Ram
Mat  And the son of Ram was Amminadab and the son of Amminadab was Nahshon and the son of Nahshon was Salmon
Mat  And the son of Salmon by Rahab was Boaz and the son of Boaz by Ruth was Obed and the son of Obed was Jesse
Mat  And the son of Jesse was David the king and the son of David was Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah
Mat  And the son of Solomon was Rehoboam and the son of Rehoboam was Abijah and the son of Abijah was Asa
Mat  And the son of Asa was Jehoshaphat and the son of Jehoshaphat was Joram and the son of Joram was Uzziah
Mat  And the son of Uzziah was Jotham and the son of Jotham was Ahaz and the son of Ahaz was Hezekiah
Mat  And the son of Hezekiah was Manasseh and the son of Manasseh was Amon and the son of Amon was Josiah
Mat  And the sons of Josiah were Jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the taking away to Babylon
Mat  And after the taking away to Babylon Jechoniah had a son Shealtiel and Shealtiel had Zerubbabel
Mat  And Zerubbabel had Abiud and Abiud had Eliakim and Eliakim had Azor
Mat  And Azor had Zadok and Zadok had Achim and Achim had Eliud
Mat  And Eliud had Eleazar and Eleazar had Matthan and Matthan had Jacob
Mat  And the son of Jacob was Joseph the husband of Mary who gave birth to Jesus whose name is Christ
Mat  So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations and from David to the taking away to Babylon fourteen generations and from the taking away to Babylon to the coming of Christ fourteen generations
Mat  Now the birth of Jesus Christ was in this way when his mother Mary was going to be married to Joseph before they came together the discovery was made that she was with child by the Holy Spirit
Mat  And Joseph her husband being an upright man and not desiring to make her a public example had a mind to put her away privately
Mat  But when he was giving thought to these things an angel of the Lord came to him in a dream saying Joseph son of David have no fear of taking Mary as your wife because that which is in her body is of the Holy Spirit
Mat  And she will give birth to a son and you will give him the name Jesus for he will give his people salvation from their sins
Mat  Now all this took place so that the word of the Lord by the prophet might come true
Mat  See the virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son and they will give him the name Immanuel that is God with us
Mat  And Joseph did as the angel of the Lord had said to him and took her as his wife
Mat  And he had no connection with her till she had given birth to a son and he gave him the name Jesus
Mat  Now when the birth of Jesus took place in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem
Mat  Saying Where is the King of the Jews whose birth has now taken place We have seen his star in the east and have come to give him worship
Mat  And when it came to the ears of Herod the king he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him
Mat  And he got together all the chief priests and scribes of the people questioning them as to where the birthplace of the Christ would be
Mat  And they said to him In Bethlehem of Judaea for so it is said in the writings of the prophet
Mat  You Bethlehem in the land of Judah are not the least among the chiefs of Judah out of you will come a ruler who will be the keeper of my people Israel
Mat  Then Herod sent for the wise men privately and put questions to them about what time the star had been seen
Mat  And he sent them to Bethlehem and said Go and make certain where the young child is and when you have seen him let me have news of it so that I may come and give him worship
Mat  And after hearing the king they went on their way and the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came to rest over the place where the young child was
Mat  And when they saw the star they were full of joy
Mat  And they came into the house and saw the young child with Mary his mother and falling down on their faces they gave him worship and from their store they gave him offerings of gold perfume and spices
Mat  And it was made clear to them by God in a dream that they were not to go back to Herod so they went into their country by another way
Mat  And when they had gone an angel of the Lord came to Joseph in a dream saying Get up and take the young child and his mother and go into Egypt and do not go from there till I give you word for Herod will be searching for the young child to put him to death
Mat  So he took the young child and his mother by night and went into Egypt
Mat  And was there till the death of Herod so that the word of the Lord through the prophet might come true Out of Egypt have I sent for my son
Mat  Then Herod when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men was very angry and he sent out and put to death all the male children in Bethlehem and in all the parts round about it from two years old and under acting on the knowledge which he had got with care from the wise men
Mat  Then the word of Jeremiah the prophet came true
Mat  In Ramah there was a sound of weeping and great sorrow Rachel weeping for her children and she would not be comforted for their loss
Mat  But when Herod was dead an angel of the Lord came in a dream to Joseph in Egypt
Mat  Saying Get up and take the young child and his mother and go into the land of Israel because they who were attempting to take the young childs life are dead
Mat  And he got up and took the young child and his mother and came into the land of Israel
Mat  But when it came to his ears that Archelaus was ruling over Judaea in the place of his father Herod he was in fear of going there and God having given him news of the danger in a dream he went out of the way into the country parts of Galilee
Mat  And he came and was living in a town named Nazareth so that the word of the prophets might come true He will be named a Nazarene
Mat  And in those days John the Baptist came preaching in the waste land of Judaea
Mat  Saying Let your hearts be turned from sin for the kingdom of heaven is near
Mat  For this is he of whom Isaiah the prophet said The voice of one crying in the waste land Make ready the way of the Lord make his roads straight
Mat  Now John was clothed in camels hair with a leather band about him and his food was locusts and honey
Mat  Then Jerusalem and all Judaea went out to him and all the people from near Jordan
Mat  And they were given baptism by him in the river Jordan saying openly that they had done wrong
Mat  But when he saw a number of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism he said to them Offspring of snakes at whose word are you going in flight from the wrath to come
Mat  Let your change of heart be seen in your works
Mat  And say not to yourselves We have Abraham for our father because I say to you that God is able from these stones to make children for Abraham
Mat  And even now the axe is put to the root of the trees every tree then which does not give good fruit is cut down and put into the fire
Mat  Truly I give baptism with water to those of you whose hearts are changed but he who comes after me is greater than I whose shoes I am not good enough to take up he will give you baptism with the Holy Spirit and with fire
Mat  In whose hand is the instrument with which he will make clean his grain he will put the good grain in his store but the waste will be burned up in the fire which will never be put out
Mat  Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be given baptism by him
Mat  But John would have kept him back saying It is I who have need of baptism from you and do you come to me
Mat  But Jesus made answer saying to him Let it be so now because so it is right for us to make righteousness complete Then he gave him baptism
Mat  And Jesus having been given baptism straight away went up from the water and the heavens opening he saw the Spirit of God coming down on him as a dove
Mat  And a voice came out of heaven saying This is my dearly loved Son with whom I am well pleased
Mat  Then Jesus was sent by the Spirit into the waste land to be tested by the Evil One
Mat  And after going without food for forty days and forty nights he was in need of it
Mat  And the Evil One came and said to him If you are the Son of God give the word for these stones to become bread
Mat  But he made answer and said It is in the Writings Bread is not mans only need but every word which comes out of the mouth of God
Mat  Then the Evil One took him to the holy town and he put him on the highest point of the Temple and said to him
Mat  If you are the Son of God let yourself go down for it is in the Writings He will give his angels care over you and In their hands they will keep you up so that your foot may not be crushed against a stone
Mat  Jesus said to him Again it is in the Writings You may not put the Lord your God to the test
Mat  Again the Evil One took him up to a very high mountain and let him see all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them
Mat  And he said to him All these things will I give you if you will go down on your face and give me worship
Mat  Then said Jesus to him Away Satan for it is in the Writings Give worship to the Lord your God and be his servant only
Mat  Then the Evil One went away from him and angels came and took care of him
Mat  Now when it came to his ears that John had been put in prison he went away to Galilee
Mat  And going away from Nazareth he came and made his livingplace in Capernaum which is by the sea in the country of Zebulun and Naphtali
Mat  So that the word of the prophet Isaiah might come true
Mat  The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali by the way of the sea the other side of Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles
Mat  The people who were in the dark saw a great light and to those in the land of the shade of death did the dawn come up
Mat  From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying Let your hearts be turned from sin for the kingdom of heaven is near
Mat  And when he was walking by the sea of Galilee he saw two brothers Simon whose other name was Peter and Andrew his brother who were putting a net into the sea for they were fishermen
Mat  And he said to them Come after me and I will make you fishers of men
Mat  And straight away they let go the nets and went after him
Mat  And going on from there he saw two other brothers James the son of Zebedee and John his brother in the boat with their father stitching up their nets and he said Come
Mat  And they went straight from the boat and their father and came after him
Mat  And Jesus went about in all Galilee teaching in their Synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom and making well those who were ill with any disease among the people
Mat  And news of him went out through all Syria and they took to him all who were ill with different diseases and pains those having evil spirits and those who were off their heads and those who had no power of moving And he made them well
Mat  And there went after him great numbers from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judaea and from the other side of Jordan
Mat  And seeing great masses of people he went up into the mountain and when he was seated his disciples came to him
Mat  And with these words he gave them teaching saying
Mat  Happy are the poor in spirit for the kingdom of heaven is theirs
Mat  Happy are those who are sad for they will be comforted
Mat  Happy are the gentle for the earth will be their heritage
Mat  Happy are those whose hearts desire is for righteousness for they will have their desire
Mat  Happy are those who have mercy for they will be given mercy
Mat  Happy are the clean in heart for they will see God
Mat  Happy are the peacemakers for they will be named sons of God
Mat  Happy are those who are attacked on account of righteousness for the kingdom of heaven will be theirs
Mat  Happy are you when men give you a bad name and are cruel to you and say all evil things against you falsely because of me
Mat  Be glad and full of joy for great is your reward in heaven for so were the prophets attacked who were before you
Mat  You are the salt of the earth but if its taste goes from the salt how will you make it salt again it is then good for nothing but to be put out and crushed under foot by men
Mat  You are the light of the world A town put on a hill may be seen by all
Mat  And a burning light is not put under a vessel but on its table so that its rays may be shining on all who are in the house
Mat  Even so let your light be shining before men so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven
Mat  Let there be no thought that I have come to put an end to the law or the prophets I have not come for destruction but to make complete
Mat  Truly I say to you Till heaven and earth come to an end not the smallest letter or part of a letter will in any way be taken from the law till all things are done
Mat  Whoever then goes against the smallest of these laws teaching men to do the same will be named least in the kingdom of heaven but he who keeps the laws teaching others to keep them will be named great in the kingdom of heaven
Mat  For I say to you If your righteousness is not greater than the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees you will never go into the kingdom of heaven
Mat  You have knowledge that it was said in old times You may not put to death and Whoever puts to death will be in danger of being judged
Mat  But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be in danger of being judged and he who says to his brother Raca will be in danger from the Sanhedrin and whoever says You foolish one will be in danger of the hell of fire
Mat  If then you are making an offering at the altar and there it comes to your mind that your brother has something against you
Mat  While your offering is still before the altar first go and make peace with your brother then come and make your offering
Mat  Come to an agreement quickly with him who has a cause against you at law while you are with him on the way for fear that he may give you up to the judge and the judge may give you to the police and you may be put into prison
Mat  Truly I say to you You will not come out from there till you have made payment of the very last farthing
Mat  You have knowledge that it was said You may not have connection with another mans wife
Mat  But I say to you that everyone whose eyes are turned on a woman with desire has had connection with her in his heart
Mat  And if your right eye is a cause of trouble to you take it out and put it away from you because it is better to undergo the loss of one part than for all your body to go into hell
Mat  And if your right hand is a cause of trouble to you let it be cut off and put it away from you because it is better to undergo the loss of one part than for all your body to go into hell
Mat  Again it was said Whoever puts away his wife has to give her a statement in writing for this purpose
Mat  But I say to you that everyone who puts away his wife for any other cause but the loss of her virtue makes her false to her husband and whoever takes her as his wife after she is put away is no true husband to her
Mat  Again you have knowledge that it was said in old times Do not take false oaths but give effect to your oaths to the Lord
Mat  But I say to you Take no oaths at all not by the heaven because it is the seat of God
Mat  Or by the earth because it is the restingplace for his foot or by Jerusalem because it is the town of the great King
Mat  You may not take an oath by your head because you are not able to make one hair white or black
Mat  But let your words be simply Yes or No and whatever is more than these is of the Evil One
Mat  You have knowledge that it was said An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
Mat  But I say to you Do not make use of force against an evil man but to him who gives you a blow on the right side of your face let the left be turned
Mat  And if any man goes to law with you and takes away your coat do not keep back your robe from him
Mat  And whoever makes you go one mile go with him two
Mat  Give to him who comes with a request and keep not your property from him who would for a time make use of it
Mat  You have knowledge that it was said Have love for your neighbour and hate for him who is against you
Mat  But I say to you Have love for those who are against you and make prayer for those who are cruel to you
Mat  So that you may be the sons of your Father in heaven for his sun gives light to the evil and to the good and he sends rain on the upright man and on the sinner
Mat  For if you have love for those who have love for you what credit is it to you do not the taxfarmers the same
Mat  And if you say Good day to your brothers only what do you do more than others do not even the Gentiles the same
Mat  Be then complete in righteousness even as your Father in heaven is complete
Mat  Take care not to do your good works before men to be seen by them or you will have no reward from your Father in heaven
Mat  When then you give money to the poor do not make a noise about it as the falsehearted men do in the Synagogues and in the streets so that they may have glory from men Truly I say to you They have their reward
Mat  But when you give money let not your left hand see what your right hand does
Mat  So that your giving may be in secret and your Father who sees in secret will give you your reward
Mat  And when you make your prayers be not like the falsehearted men who take pleasure in getting up and saying their prayers in the Synagogues and at the street turnings so that they may be seen by men Truly I say to you They have their reward
Mat  But when you make your prayer go into your private room and shutting the door say a prayer to your Father in secret and your Father who sees in secret will give you your reward
Mat  And in your prayer do not make use of the same words again and again as the Gentiles do for they have the idea that God will give attention to them because of the number of their words
Mat  So be not like them because your Father has knowledge of your needs even before you make your requests to him
Mat  Let this then be your prayer Our Father in heaven may your name be kept holy
Mat  Let your kingdom come Let your pleasure be done as in heaven so on earth
Mat  Give us this day bread for our needs
Mat  And make us free of our debts as we have made those free who are in debt to us
Mat  And let us not be put to the test but keep us safe from the Evil One
Mat  For if you let men have forgiveness for their sins you will have forgiveness from your Father in heaven
Mat  But if you do not let men have forgiveness for their sins you will not have forgiveness from your Father for your sins
Mat  And when you go without food be not sadfaced as the falsehearted are For they go about with changed looks so that men may see that they are going without food Truly I say to you They have their reward
Mat  But when you go without food put oil on your head and make your face clean
Mat  So that no one may see that you are going without food but your Father in secret and your Father who sees in secret will give you your reward
Mat  Make no store of wealth for yourselves on earth where it may be turned to dust by worms and weather and where thieves may come in by force and take it away
Mat  But make a store for yourselves in heaven where it will not be turned to dust and where thieves do not come in to take it away
Mat  For where your wealth is there will your heart be
Mat  The light of the body is the eye if then your eye is true all your body will be full of light
Mat  But if your eye is evil all your body will be dark If then the light which is in you is dark how dark it will be
Mat  No man is able to be a servant to two masters for he will have hate for the one and love for the other or he will keep to one and have no respect for the other You may not be servants of God and of wealth
Mat  So I say to you Take no thought for your life about food or drink or about clothing for your body Is not life more than food and the body more than its clothing
Mat  See the birds of heaven they do not put seeds in the earth they do not get in grain or put it in storehouses and your Father in heaven gives them food Are you not of much more value than they
Mat  And which of you by taking thought is able to make himself a cubit taller
Mat  And why are you troubled about clothing See the flowers of the field how they come up they do no work they make no thread
Mat  But I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these
Mat  But if God gives such clothing to the grass of the field which is here today and tomorrow is put into the oven will he not much more give you clothing O you of little faith
Mat  Then do not be full of care saying What are we to have for food or drink or With what may we be clothed
Mat  Because the Gentiles go in search of all these things for your Father in heaven has knowledge that you have need of all these things
Mat  But let your first care be for his kingdom and his righteousness and all these other things will be given to you in addition
Mat  Then have no care for tomorrow tomorrow will take care of itself Take the trouble of the day as it comes
Mat  Be not judges of others and you will not be judged
Mat  For as you have been judging so you will be judged and with your measure will it be measured to you
Mat  And why do you take note of the grain of dust in your brothers eye but take no note of the bit of wood which is in your eye
Mat  Or how will you say to your brother Let me take out the grain of dust from your eye when you yourself have a bit of wood in your eye
Mat  You false one first take out the bit of wood from your eye then will you see clearly to take out the grain of dust from your brothers eye
Mat  Do not give that which is holy to the dogs or put your jewels before pigs for fear that they will be crushed under foot by the pigs whose attack will then be made against you
Mat  Make a request and it will be answered what you are searching for you will get give the sign and the door will be open to you
Mat  Because to everyone who makes a request it will be given and he who is searching will get his desire and to him who gives the sign the door will be open
Mat  Or which of you if his son makes a request for bread will give him a stone
Mat  Or if he makes a request for a fish will give him a snake
Mat  If you then being evil are able to give good things to your children how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who make requests to him
Mat  All those things then which you would have men do to you even so do you to them because this is the law and the prophets
Mat  Go in by the narrow door for wide is the door and open is the way which goes to destruction and great numbers go in by it
Mat  For narrow is the door and hard the road to life and only a small number make discovery of it
Mat  Be on the watch for false prophets who come to you in sheeps clothing but inside they are cruel wolves
Mat  By their fruits you will get knowledge of them Do men get grapes from thorns or figs from thistles
Mat  Even so every good tree gives good fruit but the bad tree gives evil fruit
Mat  It is not possible for a good tree to give bad fruit and a bad tree will not give good fruit
Mat  Every tree which does not give good fruit is cut down and put in the fire
Mat  So by their fruits you will get knowledge of them
Mat  Not everyone who says to me Lord Lord will go into the kingdom of heaven but he who does the pleasure of my Father in heaven
Mat  A great number will say to me on that day Lord Lord were we not prophets in your name and did we not by your name send out evil spirits and by your name do works of power
Mat  And then will I say to them I never had knowledge of you go from me you workers of evil
Mat  Everyone then to whom my words come and who does them will be like a wise man who made his house on a rock
Mat  And the rain came down and there was a rush of waters and the winds were driving against that house but it was not moved because it was based on the rock
Mat  And everyone to whom my words come and who does them not will be like a foolish man who made his house on sand
Mat  And the rain came down and there was a rush of waters and the winds were driving against that house and it came down and great was its fall
Mat  And it came about when Jesus had come to the end of these words that the people were surprised at his teaching
Mat  for he was teaching as one having authority and not as their scribes
Mat  And when he had come down from the mountain great numbers of people came after him
Mat  And a leper came and gave him worship saying Lord if it is your pleasure you have power to make me clean
Mat  And he put his hand on him saying It is my pleasure be clean And straight away he was made clean
Mat  And Jesus said to him See that you say nothing about this to anyone but go and let the priest see you and make the offering which was ordered by Moses for a witness to them
Mat  And when Jesus was come into Capernaum a certain captain came to him with a request
Mat  Saying Lord my servant is ill in bed at the house with no power in his body and in great pain
Mat  And he said to him I will come and make him well
Mat  And the captain in answer said Lord I am not good enough for you to come under my roof but only say the word and my servant will be made well
Mat  Because I myself am a man under authority having under me fighting men and I say to this one Go and he goes and to another Come and he comes and to my servant Do this and he does it
Mat  And when these words came to the ears of Jesus he was surprised and said to those who came after him Truly I say to you I have not seen such great faith no not in Israel
Mat  And I say to you that numbers will come from the east and the west and will take their seats with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven
Mat  But the sons of the kingdom will be put out into the dark and there will be weeping and cries of pain
Mat  And Jesus said to the captain Go in peace as your faith is so let it be done to you And the servant was made well in that hour
Mat  And when Jesus had come into Peters house he saw his wifes mother in bed very ill
Mat  And he put his hand on hers and the disease went from her and she got up and took care of his needs
Mat  And in the evening they took to him a number of people who had evil spirits and he sent the spirits out of them with a word and made well all who were ill
Mat  So that the word of Isaiah the prophet might come true He himself took our pains and our diseases
Mat  Now when Jesus saw a great mass of people about him he gave an order to go to the other side
Mat  And there came a scribe and said to him Master I will come after you wherever you go
Mat  And Jesus said to him The foxes have holes and the birds of heaven have a restingplace but the Son of man has nowhere to put his head
Mat  And another of the disciples said to him Lord let me first go and give the last honours to my father
Mat  But Jesus said to him Come after me and let the dead take care of their dead
Mat  And when he had got into a boat his disciples went after him
Mat  And there came up a great storm in the sea so that the boat was covered with the waves but he was sleeping
Mat  And they came to him and awaking him said Help Lord destruction is near
Mat  And he said to them Why are you full of fear O you of little faith Then he got up and gave orders to the winds and the sea and there was a great calm
Mat  And the men were full of wonder saying What sort of man is this that even the winds and the sea do his orders
Mat  And when he had come to the other side to the country of the Gadarenes there came out to him from the place of the dead two who had evil spirits so violent that no man was able to go that way
Mat  And they gave a loud cry saying What have we to do with you you Son of God Have you come here to give us punishment before the time
Mat  Now there was some distance away a great herd of pigs taking their food
Mat  And the evil spirits made strong prayers to him saying If you send us out let us go into the herd of pigs
Mat  And he said to them Go And they came out and went into the pigs and the herd went rushing down a sharp slope into the sea and came to their end in the water
Mat  And their keepers went in flight to the town and gave an account of everything and of the men who had the evil spirits
Mat  And all the town came out to Jesus and seeing him they made request that he would go away from their part of the country
Mat  And he got into a boat and went across and came to his town
Mat  And they took to him a man stretched on a bed who had no power of moving and Jesus seeing their faith said to the man who was ill Son take heart you have forgiveness for your sins
Mat  And some of the scribes said among themselves This man has no respect for God
Mat  And Jesus having knowledge of what was in their minds said Why are your thoughts evil
Mat  For which is the simpler to say You have forgiveness for your sins or to say Get up and go
Mat  But so that you may see that on earth the Son of man has authority for the forgiveness of sins then said he to the man who was ill Get up and take up your bed and go to your house
Mat  And he got up and went away to his house
Mat  But when the people saw it they were full of fear and gave glory to God who had given such authority to men
Mat  And when Jesus was going from there he saw a man whose name was Matthew seated at the place where taxes were taken and he said to him Come after me And he got up and went after him
Mat  And it came about when he was in the house taking food that a number of taxfarmers and sinners came and took their places with Jesus and his disciples
Mat  And when the Pharisees saw it they said to his disciples Why does your Master take food with taxfarmers and sinners
Mat  But on hearing this he said Those who are well have no need of a medical man but those who are ill
Mat  But go and take to heart the sense of these words My desire is for mercy not offerings for I have come not to get the upright but sinners
Mat  Then the disciples of John came to him saying Why do we and the Pharisees frequently go without food but your disciples do not
Mat  And Jesus said to them Will the friends of the newlymarried man be sad as long as he is with them But the days will come when he will be taken away from them and then will they go without food
Mat  And no man puts a bit of new cloth on an old coat for by pulling away from the old it makes a worse hole
Mat  And men do not put new wine into old wineskins or the skins will be burst and the wine will come out and the skins are of no more use but they put new wine into new wineskins and so the two will be safe
Mat  While he was saying these things to them there came a ruler and gave him worship saying My daughter is even now dead but come and put your hand on her and she will come back to life
Mat  And Jesus got up and went after him and so did his disciples
Mat  And a woman who for twelve years had had a flow of blood came after him and put her hand on the edge of his robe
Mat  Because she said to herself if I may but put my hand on his robe I will be made well
Mat  But Jesus turning and seeing her said Daughter take heart your faith has made you well And the woman was made well from that hour
Mat  And when Jesus came into the rulers house and saw the players with their instruments and the people making a noise
Mat  He said Make room for the girl is not dead but sleeping And they were laughing at him
Mat  But when the people were sent out he went in and took her by the hand and the girl got up
Mat  And the news of it went out into all that land
Mat  And when Jesus went on from there two blind men came after him crying out Have mercy on us you Son of David
Mat  And when he had come into the house the blind men came to him and Jesus said to them Have you faith that I am able to do this They said to him Yes Lord
Mat  Then he put his hand on their eyes saying As your faith is let it be done to you
Mat  And their eyes were made open And Jesus said to them sharply Let no man have knowledge of it
Mat  But they went out and gave news of him in all that land
Mat  And while they were going away there came to him a man without the power of talking and with an evil spirit
Mat  And when the evil spirit had been sent out the man had the power of talking and they were all surprised saying Such a thing has never been seen in Israel
Mat  But the Pharisees said By the ruler of evil spirits he sends evil spirits out of men
Mat  And Jesus went about all the towns and small places teaching in their Synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom and making well all sorts of disease and pain
Mat  But when he saw all the people he was moved with pity for them because they were troubled and wandering like sheep without a keeper
Mat  Then he said to his disciples There is much grain but not enough men to get it in
Mat  Make prayer then to the Lord of the grainfields that he may send out workers to get in his grain
Mat  And he got together his twelve disciples and gave them the power of driving out unclean spirits and of making well all sorts of disease and pain
Mat  Now the names of the twelve are these The first Simon who is named Peter and Andrew his brother James the son of Zebedee and John his brother
Mat  Philip and Bartholomew Thomas and Matthew the taxfarmer James the son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus
Mat  Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot who was false to him
Mat  These twelve Jesus sent out and gave them orders saying Do not go among the Gentiles or into any town of Samaria
Mat  But go to the wandering sheep of the house of Israel
Mat  And on your way say The kingdom of heaven is near
Mat  Make well those who are ill give life to the dead make lepers clean send evil spirits out of men freely it has been given to you freely give
Mat  Take no gold or silver or copper in your pockets
Mat  Take no bag for your journey and do not take two coats or shoes or a stick for the workman has a right to his food
Mat  And into whatever town or small place you go make search there for someone who is respected and make his house your restingplace till you go away
Mat  And when you go in say May peace be on this house
Mat  And if the house is good enough let your peace come on it but if not let your peace come back to you
Mat  And whoever will not take you in or give ear to your words when you go out from that house or that town put off its dust from your feet
Mat  Truly I say to you It will be better for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of Gods judging than for that town
Mat  See I send you out as sheep among wolves Be then as wise as snakes and as gentle as doves
Mat  But be on the watch against men for they will give you up to the Sanhedrins and in their Synagogues they will give you blows
Mat  And you will come before rulers and kings because of me for a witness to them and to the Gentiles
Mat  But when you are given up into their hands do not be troubled about what to say or how to say it for in that hour what you are to say will be given to you
Mat  Because it is not you who say the words but the Spirit of your Father in you
Mat  And brother will give up brother to death and the father his child and children will go against their fathers and mothers and put them to death
Mat  And you will be hated by all men because of my name but he who is strong to the end will have salvation
Mat  But when they are cruel to you in one town go in flight to another for truly I say to you You will not have gone through the towns of Israel before the Son of man comes
Mat  A disciple is not greater than his master or a servant than his lord
Mat  It is enough for the disciple that he may be as his master and the servant as his lord If they have given the name Beelzebub to the master of the house how much more to those of his house
Mat  Have then no fear of them because nothing is covered which will not come to light or secret which will not be made clear
Mat  What I say to you in the dark say in the light and what comes to your ear secretly say publicly from the housetops
Mat  And have no fear of those who put to death the body but are not able to put to death the soul But have fear of him who has power to give soul and body to destruction in hell
Mat  Are not sparrows two a farthing and not one of them comes to an end without your Father
Mat  But the hairs of your head are all numbered
Mat  Then have no fear you are of more value than a flock of sparrows
Mat  To everyone then who gives witness to me before men I will give witness before my Father in heaven
Mat  But if anyone says before men that he has no knowledge of me I will say that I have no knowledge of him before my Father in heaven
Mat  Do not have the thought that I have come to send peace on the earth I came not to send peace but a sword
Mat  For I have come to put a man against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughterinlaw against her motherinlaw
Mat  And a man will be hated by those of his house
Mat  He who has more love for his father or mother than for me is not good enough for me he who has more love for son or daughter than for me is not good enough for me
Mat  And he who does not take his cross and come after me is not good enough for me
Mat  He who has the desire to keep his life will have it taken from him and he who gives up his life because of me will have it given back to him
Mat  He who gives honour to you gives honour to me and he who gives honour to me gives honour to him who sent me
Mat  He who gives honour to a prophet in the name of a prophet will be given a prophets reward and he who gives honour to an upright man in the name of an upright man will be given an upright mans reward
Mat  And whoever gives to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple truly I say to you he will not go without his reward
Mat  And it came about that when Jesus had come to the end of giving these orders to his twelve disciples he went away from there teaching and preaching in their towns
Mat  Now when John had news in prison of the works of the Christ he sent his disciples
Mat  To say to him Are you he who is to come or are we waiting for another
Mat  And Jesus answering said to them Go and give news to John of the things which you are seeing and hearing
Mat  The blind see those who were not able to are walking lepers are made clean those who were without hearing now have their ears open the dead come to life again and the poor have the good news given to them
Mat  And a blessing will be on him who has no doubts about me
Mat  And when they were going away Jesus talking of John said to all the people What went you out into the waste land to see a tall stem moving in the wind
Mat  But what went you out to see a man delicately clothed Those who have fair robes are in kings houses
Mat  But why did you go out to see a prophet Yes I say to you and more than a prophet
Mat  This is he of whom it has been said See I send my servant before your face who will make ready your way before you
Mat  Truly I say to you Among the sons of women there has not been a greater than John the Baptist but he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he
Mat  And from the days of John the Baptist till now the kingdom of heaven is forcing its way in and men of force take it
Mat  For all the prophets and the law were in force till John
Mat  And if you are able to see it this is Elijah who was to come
Mat  He who has ears let him give ear
Mat  But what comparison may I make of this generation It is like children seated in the marketplaces crying out to one another
Mat  We made music for you and you did not take part in the dance we gave cries of sorrow and you made no signs of grief
Mat  For John came taking no food or drink and they say He has an evil spirit
Mat  The Son of man has come feasting and they say See a lover of food and wine a friend of taxfarmers and sinners And wisdom is judged to be right by her works
Mat  Then he went on to say hard things to the towns where most of his works of power were done because they had not been turned from their sins
Mat  Unhappy are you Chorazin Unhappy are you Bethsaida For if the works of power which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon they would have been turned from their sins in days gone by clothing themselves in haircloth and putting dust on their heads
Mat  But I say to you It will be better for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judging than for you
Mat  And you Capernaum were you not to be lifted up to heaven you will go down into hell for if the works of power which were done in you had been done in Sodom it would have been here to this day
Mat  But I say to you that it will be better for the land of Sodom in the day of judging than for you
Mat  At that time Jesus made answer and said I give praise to you O Father Lord of heaven and earth because you have kept these things secret from the wise and the men of learning and have made them clear to little children
Mat  Yes Father for so it was pleasing in your eyes
Mat  All things have been given to me by my Father and no one has knowledge of the Son but the Father and no one has knowledge of the Father but the Son and he to whom the Son will make it clear
Mat  Come to me all you who are troubled and weighted down with care and I will give you rest
Mat  Take my yoke on you and become like me for I am gentle and without pride and you will have rest for your souls
Mat  For my yoke is good and the weight I take up is not hard
Mat  At that time Jesus went through the fields on the Sabbath day and his disciples being in need of food were taking the heads of grain
Mat  But the Pharisees when they saw it said to him See your disciples do that which it is not right to do on the Sabbath
Mat  But he said to them Have you no knowledge of what David did when he had need of food and those who were with him
Mat  How he went into the house of God and took for food the holy bread which it was not right for him or for those who were with him to take but only for the priests
Mat  Or is it not said in the law how the Sabbath is broken by the priests in the Temple and they do no wrong
Mat  But I say to you that a greater thing than the Temple is here
Mat  But if these words had been in your minds My desire is for mercy and not for offerings you would not have been judging those who have done no wrong
Mat  For the Son of man is lord of the Sabbath
Mat  And he went from there into their Synagogue
Mat  And there was a man with a dead hand And they put a question to him saying Is it right to make a man well on the Sabbath day so that they might have something against him
Mat  And he said to them Which of you having a sheep if it gets into a hole on the Sabbath day will not put out a helping hand and get it back
Mat  Of how much more value is a man than a sheep For this reason it is right to do good on the Sabbath day
Mat  Then said he to the man Put out your hand And he put it out and it was made as well as the other
Mat  But the Pharisees went out and made designs against him how they might put him to death
Mat  And Jesus having knowledge of this went away from there and a great number went after him and he made them all well
Mat  Ordering them not to give people word of him
Mat  So that what was said by Isaiah the prophet might come true
Mat  See my servant the man of my selection my loved one in whom my soul is well pleased I will put my Spirit on him and he will make my decision clear to the Gentiles
Mat  His coming will not be with fighting or loud cries and his voice will not be lifted up in the streets
Mat  The crushed stem will not be broken by him and the feebly burning light will he not put out till he has made righteousness overcome all
Mat  And in his name will the Gentiles put their hope
Mat  Then they took to him one with an evil spirit who was blind and had no power of talking and he made him well so that he had the power of talking and seeing
Mat  And all the people were surprised and said Is not this the Son of David
Mat  But the Pharisees hearing of it said This man only sends evil spirits out of men by Beelzebub the ruler of evil spirits
Mat  And having knowledge of their thoughts he said to them Every kingdom having division in itself is made waste and every town or house having division in itself will come to destruction
Mat  And if Satan sends out Satan he makes war against himself how then will he keep his kingdom
Mat  And if I by Beelzebub send evil spirits out of men by whom do your sons send them out So let them be your judges
Mat  But if I by the Spirit of God send out evil spirits then is the kingdom of God come on you
Mat  Or how may one go into a strong mans house and take his goods if he does not first put cords round the strong man and then he may take his goods
Mat  Whoever is not with me is against me and he who does not take part with me in getting people together is driving them away
Mat  So I say to you Every sin and every evil word against God will have forgiveness but for evil words against the Spirit there will be no forgiveness
Mat  And whoever says a word against the Son of man will have forgiveness but whoever says a word against the Holy Spirit will not have forgiveness in this life or in that which is to come
Mat  Make the tree good and its fruit good or make the tree bad and its fruit bad for by its fruit you will get knowledge of the tree
Mat  You offspring of snakes how are you being evil able to say good things because out of the hearts store come the words of the mouth
Mat  The good man out of his good store gives good things and the evil man out of his evil store gives evil things
Mat  And I say to you that in the day when they are judged men will have to give an account of every foolish word they have said
Mat  For by your words will your righteousness be seen and by your words you will be judged
Mat  Then some of the scribes and Pharisees hearing this said to him Master we are looking for a sign from you
Mat  But he answering said to them An evil and false generation is looking for a sign and no sign will be given to it but the sign of the prophet Jonah
Mat  For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the stomach of the great fish so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth
Mat  The men of Nineveh will come up in the day of judging and give their decision against this generation because they were turned from their sins at the preaching of Jonah and now a greater than Jonah is here
Mat  The queen of the South will come up in the day of judging and give her decision against this generation for she came from the ends of the earth to give ear to the wisdom of Solomon and now a greater than Solomon is here
Mat  But the unclean spirit when he is gone out of a man goes through dry places looking for rest and getting it not
Mat  Then he says I will go back into my house from which I came out and when he comes he sees that there is no one in it but that it has been made fair and clean
Mat  Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits worse than himself and they go in and make it their livingplace and the last condition of that man is worse than the first Even so will it be with this evil generation
Mat  While he was still talking to the people his mother and his brothers came desiring to have talk with him
Mat  And one said to him See your mother and your brothers are outside desiring to have talk with you
Mat  But he in answer said to him who gave the news Who is my mother and who are my brothers
Mat  And he put out his hand to his disciples and said See my mother and my brothers
Mat  For whoever does the pleasure of my Father in heaven he is my brother and sister and mother
Mat  On that day Jesus went out of the house and was seated by the seaside
Mat  And great numbers of people came together to him so that he got into a boat and the people took up their position by the sea
Mat  And he gave them teaching in the form of a story saying A man went out to put seed in the earth
Mat  And while he did so some seeds were dropped by the wayside and the birds came and took them for food
Mat  And some of the seed went among the stones where it had not much earth and straight away it came up because the earth was not deep
Mat  And when the sun was high it was burned and because it had no root it became dry and dead
Mat  And some seeds went among thorns and the thorns came up and they had no room for growth
Mat  And some falling on good earth gave fruit some a hundred some sixty some thirty times as much
Mat  He who has ears let him give ear
Mat  And the disciples came and said to him Why do you say things to them in the form of stories
Mat  And he said to them in answer To you is given the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given
Mat  Because whoever has to him will be given and he will have more but from him who has not even what he has will be taken away
Mat  For this reason I put things into the form of stories because they see without seeing and give ear without hearing and the sense is not clear to them
Mat  And for them the words of Isaiah have come true Though you give ear you will not get knowledge and seeing you will see but the sense will not be clear to you
Mat  For the heart of this people has become fat and their ears are slow in hearing and their eyes are shut for fear that they might see with their eyes and give hearing with their ears and become wise in their hearts and be turned again to me so that I might make them well
Mat  But a blessing be on your eyes because they see and on your ears because they are open
Mat  For truly I say to you that prophets and upright men had a desire to see the things which you see and saw them not and to have knowledge of the words which have come to your ears and they had it not
Mat  Give ear then to the story of the man who put the seed in the earth
Mat  When the word of the kingdom comes to anyone and the sense of it is not clear to him then the Evil One comes and quickly takes away that which was put in his heart He is the seed dropped by the wayside
Mat  And that which went on the stones this is he who hearing the word straight away takes it with joy
Mat  But having no root in himself he goes on for a time and when trouble comes or pain because of the word he quickly becomes full of doubts
Mat  And that which was dropped among the thorns this is he who has the word and the cares of this life and the deceits of wealth put a stop to the growth of the word and it gives no fruit
Mat  And the seed which was put in good earth this is he who gives ear to the word and gets the sense of it who gives fruit some a hundred some sixty some thirty times as much
Mat  And he gave them another story saying The kingdom of heaven is like a man who put good seed in his field
Mat  But while men were sleeping one who had hate for him came and put evil seeds among the grain and went away
Mat  But when the green stem came up and gave fruit the evil plants were seen at the same time
Mat  And the servants of the master of the house came and said to him Sir did you not put good seed in your field how then has it evil plants
Mat  And he said Someone has done this in hate And the servants say to him Is it your pleasure that we go and take them up
Mat  But he says No for fear that by chance while you take up the evil plants you may be rooting up the grain with them
Mat  Let them come up together till the getting in of the grain and then I will say to the workers Take up first the evil plants and put them together for burning but put the grain into my storehouse
Mat  He put another story before them saying The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and put in his field
Mat  Which is smaller than all seeds but when it has come up it is greater than the plants and becomes a tree so that the birds of heaven come and make their restingplaces in its branches
Mat  Another story he gave to them The kingdom of heaven is like leaven which a woman took and put in three measures of meal till it was all leavened
Mat  All these things Jesus said to the people in the form of stories and without a story he said nothing to them
Mat  That it might come true which was said by the prophet Opening my mouth I will give out stories I will give knowledge of things kept secret from before all time
Mat  Then he went away from the people and went into the house and his disciples came to him saying Make clear to us the story of the evil plants in the field
Mat  And he made answer and said He who puts the good seed in the earth is the Son of man
Mat  And the field is the world and the good seed is the sons of the kingdom and the evil seeds are the sons of the Evil One
Mat  And he who put them in the earth is Satan and the getting in of the grain is the end of the world and those who get it in are the angels
Mat  As then the evil plants are got together and burned with fire so will it be in the end of the world
Mat  The Son of man will send out his angels and they will take out of his kingdom everything which is a cause of error and all those who do wrong
Mat  And will put them into the fire there will be weeping and cries of sorrow
Mat  Then will the upright be shining as the sun in the kingdom of their Father He who has ears let him give ear
Mat  The kingdom of heaven is like a secret store of wealth in a field which a man came across and put back again and in his joy he goes and gives all he has to get that field
Mat  Again the kingdom of heaven is like a trader searching for beautiful jewels
Mat  And having come across one jewel of great price he went and gave all he had in exchange for it
Mat  Again the kingdom of heaven is like a net which was put into the sea and took in every sort of fish
Mat  When it was full they took it up on the sands and seated there they put the good into vessels but the bad they put away
Mat  So will it be in the end of the world the angels will come and take out the bad from the good
Mat  And will put them into the fire there will be weeping and cries of sorrow
Mat  Are all these things now clear to you They say to him Yes
Mat  And he said to them For this reason every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who gives out from his store things new and old
Mat  And when Jesus had come to the end of these stories he went away from there
Mat  And coming into his country he gave them teaching in their Synagogue so that they were greatly surprised and said Where did this man get this wisdom and these works of power
Mat  Is not this the woodworkers son is not his mother named Mary and his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas
Mat  And his sisters are they not all with us from where then has he all these things
Mat  And they were bitter against him But Jesus said to them A prophet is nowhere without honour but in his country and among his family
Mat  And the works of power which he did there were small in number because they had no faith
Mat  At that time news of Jesus came to Herod the king
Mat  And he said to his servants This is John the Baptist he has come back from the dead and so these powers are working in him
Mat  For Herod had taken John and put him in prison because of Herodias his brother Philips wife
Mat  Because John had said to him It is not right for you to have her
Mat  And he would have put him to death but for his fear of the people because in their eyes John was a prophet
Mat  But when Herods birthday came the daughter of Herodias was dancing before them and Herod was pleased with her
Mat  So he gave her his word with an oath to let her have whatever she might make request for
Mat  And she at her mothers suggestion said Give me here on a plate the head of John the Baptist
Mat  And the king was sad but because of his oaths and because of his guests he gave the order for it to be given to her
Mat  And he sent and had Johns head cut off in the prison
Mat  And his head was put on a plate and given to the girl and she took it to her mother
Mat  And his disciples came and took up his body and put it in the earth and they went and gave Jesus news of what had taken place
Mat  Now when it came to the ears of Jesus he went away from there in a boat to a waste place by himself and the people hearing of it went after him on foot from the towns
Mat  And he came out and saw a great number of people and he had pity on them and made well those of them who were ill
Mat  And when evening had come the disciples came to him saying This place is waste land and the time is now past send the people away so that they may go into the towns and get themselves food
Mat  But Jesus said to them There is no need for them to go away give them food yourselves
Mat  And they say to him We have here but five cakes of bread and two fishes
Mat  And he said Give them to me
Mat  And he gave orders for the people to be seated on the grass and he took the five cakes of bread and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he said words of blessing and made division of the food and gave it to the disciples and the disciples gave it to the people
Mat  And they all took of the food and had enough and they took up twelve baskets full of broken bits which were not used
Mat  And those who had food were about five thousand men in addition to women and children
Mat  And straight away he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side till he had sent the people away
Mat  And after he had sent the people away he went up into the mountain by himself for prayer and when evening was come he was there by himself
Mat  But the boat was now in the middle of the sea and was troubled by the waves for the wind was against them
Mat  And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them walking on the sea
Mat  And when they saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying It is a spirit and they gave cries of fear
Mat  But straight away Jesus said to them Take heart it is I have no fear
Mat  And Peter answering said to him Lord if it is you give me the order to come to you on the water
Mat  And he said Come And Peter got out of the boat and walking on the water went to Jesus
Mat  But when he saw the wind he was in fear and starting to go down he gave a cry saying Help Lord
Mat  And straight away Jesus put out his hand and took a grip of him and said to him O man of little faith why were you in doubt
Mat  And when they had got into the boat the wind went down
Mat  And those who were in the boat gave him worship saying Truly you are the Son of God
Mat  And when they had gone across they came to land at Gennesaret
Mat  And when the men of that place had news of him they sent into all the country round about and took to him all who were ill
Mat  With the request that they might only put their hands on the edge of his robe and all those who did so were made well
Mat  Then there came to Jesus from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes saying
Mat  Why do your disciples go against the teaching of the fathers for they take food with unwashed hands
Mat  And in answer he said to them Why do you yourselves go against the word of God on account of the teaching which has been handed down to you
Mat  For God said Give honour to your father and mother and He who says evil of father or mother will be put to death
Mat  But you say If a man says to his father or his mother That by which you might have had profit from me is given to God
Mat  There is no need for him to give honour to his father And you have made the word of God without effect because of your teaching
Mat  You false ones well did Isaiah say of you
Mat  These people give me honour with their lips but their heart is far from me
Mat  But their worship is to no purpose while they give as their teaching the rules of men
Mat  And he got the people together and said to them Give ear and let my words be clear to you
Mat  Not that which goes into the mouth makes a man unclean but that which comes out of the mouth
Mat  Then the disciples came and said to him Did you see that the Pharisees were troubled when these words came to their ears
Mat  But he said in answer Every plant which my Father in heaven has not put in the earth will be taken up by the roots
Mat  Let them be they are blind guides And if a blind man is guiding a blind man the two will go falling into a hole together
Mat  Then Peter said to him Make the story clear to us
Mat  And he said Are you like them still without wisdom
Mat  Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth goes on into the stomach and is sent out as waste
Mat  But the things which come out of the mouth come from the heart and they make a man unclean
Mat  For out of the heart come evil thoughts the taking of life broken faith between the married unclean desires of the flesh taking of property false witness bitter words
Mat  These are the things which make a man unclean but to take food with unwashed hands does not make a man unclean
Mat  And Jesus went away from there into the country of Tyre and Sidon
Mat  And a woman of Canaan came out from those parts crying and saying Have pity on me O Lord Son of David my daughter is greatly troubled with an unclean spirit
Mat  But he gave her no answer And his disciples came and said to him Send her away for she is crying after us
Mat  But he made answer and said I was sent only to the wandering sheep of the house of Israel
Mat  But she came and gave him worship saying Help Lord
Mat  And he made answer and said It is not right to take the childrens bread and give it to the dogs
Mat  But she said Yes Lord but even the dogs take the bits from under their masters table
Mat  Then Jesus answering said to her O woman great is your faith let your desire be done And her daughter was made well from that hour
Mat  And Jesus went from there and came to the sea of Galilee and he went up into the mountain and took his seat there
Mat  And there came to him great numbers of people having with them those who were broken in body or blind or without voice or wounded or ill in any way and a number of others they put them down at his feet and he made them well
Mat  So that the people were full of wonder when they saw that those who had no voice were talking the feeble were made strong those whose bodies were broken had the power of walking and the blind were able to see and they gave glory to the God of Israel
Mat  And Jesus got his disciples together and said I have pity for the people because they have now been with me three days and have no food and I will not send them away without food or they will have no strength for the journey
Mat  And the disciples say to him How may we get enough bread in a waste place to give food to such a number of people
Mat  And Jesus says to them How much bread have you And they said Seven cakes and some small fishes
Mat  Then he gave an order to the people to be seated on the earth
Mat  And he took the seven cakes of bread and the fishes and having given praise he gave the broken bread to the disciples and the disciples gave it to the people
Mat  And they all took food and had enough and they took up of the broken bits seven baskets full
Mat  And there were four thousand men who took food together with women and children
Mat  And when he had sent the people away he got into the boat and came into the country of Magadan
Mat  And the Pharisees and Sadducees came and testing him made a request to him to give them a sign from heaven
Mat  But in answer he said to them At nightfall you say The weather will be good for the sky is red
Mat  And in the morning The weather will be bad today for the sky is red and angry You are able to see the face of heaven but not the signs of the times
Mat  An evil and false generation is searching after a sign and no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah And he went away from them
Mat  And when the disciples came to the other side they had not taken thought to get bread
Mat  And Jesus said to them Take care to have nothing to do with the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees
Mat  And they were reasoning among themselves saying We took no bread
Mat  And Jesus seeing it said O you of little faith why are you reasoning among yourselves because you have no bread
Mat  Do you still not see or keep in mind the five cakes of bread of the five thousand and the number of baskets you took up
Mat  Or the seven cakes of bread of the four thousand and the number of baskets you took up
Mat  How is it that you do not see that I was not talking to you about bread but about keeping away from the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees
Mat  Then they saw that it was not the leaven of bread which he had in mind but the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees
Mat  Now when Jesus had come into the parts of Caesarea Philippi he said questioning his disciples Who do men say that the Son of man is
Mat  And they said Some say John the Baptist some Elijah and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets
Mat  He says to them But who do you say that I am
Mat  And Simon Peter made answer and said You are the Christ the Son of the living God
Mat  And Jesus made answer and said to him A blessing on you Simon Barjonah because this knowledge has not come to you from flesh and blood but from my Father in heaven
Mat  And I say to you that you are Peter and on this rock will my church be based and the doors of hell will not overcome it
Mat  I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever is fixed by you on earth will be fixed in heaven and whatever you make free on earth will be made free in heaven
Mat  Then he gave orders to the disciples to give no man word that he was the Christ
Mat  From that time Jesus went on to make clear to his disciples how he would have to go up to Jerusalem and undergo much at the hands of those in authority and the chief priests and scribes and be put to death and the third day come again from the dead
Mat  And Peter protesting said to him Be it far from you Lord it is impossible that this will come about
Mat  But he turning to Peter said Get out of my way Satan you are a danger to me because your mind is not on the things of God but on the things of men
Mat  Then Jesus said to his disciples If any man would come after me let him give up all and take up his cross and come after me
Mat  Because whoever has a desire to keep his life safe will have it taken from him but whoever gives up his life because of me will have it given back to him
Mat  For what profit has a man if he gets all the world with the loss of his life or what will a man give in exchange for his life
Mat  For the Son of man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels and then he will give to every man the reward of his works
Mat  Truly I say to you There are some of those here who will not have a taste of death till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom
Mat  And after six days Jesus takes with him Peter and James and John his brother and makes them go up with him into a high mountain by themselves
Mat  And he was changed in form before them and his face was shining like the sun and his clothing became white as light
Mat  And Moses and Elijah came before their eyes talking with him
Mat  And Peter made answer and said to Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if you will let me I will make here three tents one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah
Mat  While he was still talking a bright cloud came over them and a voice out of the cloud saying This is my dearly loved Son with whom I am well pleased give ear to him
Mat  And at these words the disciples went down on their faces in great fear
Mat  And Jesus came and put his hand on them and said Get up and have no fear
Mat  And lifting up their eyes they saw no one but Jesus only
Mat  And when they were coming down from the mountain Jesus gave them orders saying Let no man have word of what you have seen till the Son of man has come again from the dead
Mat  And his disciples questioning him said Why then do the scribes say that Elijah has to come first
Mat  And in answer he said Elijah truly has to come and put all things right
Mat  But I say to you that Elijah has come and they had no knowledge of him but did to him whatever they were pleased to do the same will the Son of man undergo at their hands
Mat  Then the disciples saw that he was talking to them of John the Baptist
Mat  And when they came to the people a man went down on his knees to him saying
Mat  Lord have mercy on my son for he is off his head and is in great pain and frequently he goes falling into the fire and frequently into the water
Mat  And I took him to your disciples and they were not able to make him well
Mat  And Jesus answering said O false and foolish generation how long will I be with you how long will I put up with you let him come here to me
Mat  And Jesus gave orders to the unclean spirit and it went out of him and the boy was made well from that hour
Mat  Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said Why were we not able to send it out
Mat  And he says to them Because of your little faith for truly I say to you If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed you will say to this mountain Be moved from this place to that and it will be moved and nothing will be impossible to you
Mat  
Mat  And while they were going about in Galilee Jesus said to them The Son of man will be given up into the hands of men
Mat  And they will put him to death and the third day he will come again from the dead And they were very sad
Mat  And when they had come to Capernaum those who took the Temple tax came to Peter and said Does not your master make payment of the Temple tax
Mat  He says Yes And when he came into the house Jesus said to him What is your opinion Simon from whom do the kings of the earth get payment or tax from their sons or from other people
Mat  And when he said From other people Jesus said to him Then are the sons free
Mat  But so that we may not be a cause of trouble to them go to the sea and let down a hook and take the first fish which comes up and in his mouth you will see a bit of money take that and give it to them for me and you
Mat  In that hour the disciples came to Jesus saying Who is greatest in the kingdom of heaven
Mat  And he took a little child and put him in the middle of them
Mat  And said Truly I say to you If you do not have a change of heart and become like little children you will not go into the kingdom of heaven
Mat  Whoever then will make himself as low as this little child the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven
Mat  And whoever gives honour to one such little child in my name gives honour to me
Mat  But whoever is a cause of trouble to one of these little ones who have faith in me it would be better for him to have a great stone fixed to his neck and to come to his end in the deep sea
Mat  A curse is on the earth because of trouble for it is necessary for trouble to come but unhappy is that man through whom the trouble comes
Mat  And if your hand or your foot is a cause of trouble let it be cut off and put it away from you it is better for you to go into life with the loss of a hand or a foot than having two hands or two feet to go into the eternal fire
Mat  And if your eye is a cause of trouble to you take it out and put it away from you it is better for you to go into life with one eye than having two eyes to go into the hell of fire
Mat  Let it not seem to you that one of these little ones is of no value for I say to you that in heaven their angels see at all times the face of my Father in heaven
Mat  
Mat  What would you say now if a man has a hundred sheep and one of them has gone wandering away will he not let the ninetynine be and go to the mountains in search of the wandering one
Mat  And if he comes across it truly I say to you he has more joy over it than over the ninetynine which have not gone out of the way
Mat  Even so it is not the pleasure of your Father in heaven for one of these little ones to come to destruction
Mat  And if your brother does wrong to you go make clear to him his error between you and him in private if he gives ear to you you have got your brother back again
Mat  But if he will not give ear to you take with you one or two more that by the lips of two or three witnesses every word may be made certain
Mat  And if he will not give ear to them let it come to the hearing of the church and if he will not give ear to the church let him be to you as a Gentile and a taxfarmer
Mat  Truly I say to you Whatever things are fixed by you on earth will be fixed in heaven and whatever you make free on earth will be made free in heaven
Mat  Again I say to you that if two of you are in agreement on earth about anything for which they will make a request it will be done for them by my Father in heaven
Mat  For where two or three are come together in my name there am I among them
Mat  Then Peter came and said to him Lord what number of times may my brother do wrong against me and I give him forgiveness till seven times
Mat  Jesus says to him I say not to you Till seven times but Till seventy times seven
Mat  For this reason the kingdom of heaven is like a king who went over his accounts with his servants
Mat  And at the start one came to him who was in his debt for ten thousand talents
Mat  And because he was not able to make payment his lord gave orders for him and his wife and his sons and daughters and all he had to be given for money and payment to be made
Mat  So the servant went down on his face and gave him worship saying Lord give me time to make payment and I will give you all
Mat  And the lord of that servant being moved with pity let him go and made him free of the debt
Mat  But that servant went out and meeting one of the other servants who was in debt to him for one hundred pence he took him by the throat saying Make payment of your debt
Mat  So that servant went down on his face requesting him and saying Give me time and I will make payment to you
Mat  And he would not but went and put him into prison till he had made payment of the debt
Mat  So when the other servants saw what was done they were very sad and came and gave word to their lord of what had been done
Mat  Then his lord sent for him and said You evil servant I made you free of all that debt because of your request to me
Mat  Was it not right for you to have mercy on the other servant even as I had mercy on you
Mat  And his lord was very angry and put him in the hands of those who would give him punishment till he made payment of all the debt
Mat  So will my Father in heaven do to you if you do not everyone from your hearts give forgiveness to his brother
Mat  And it came about that after saying these words Jesus went away from Galilee and came into the parts of Judaea on the other side of Jordan
Mat  And a great number went after him and he made them well there
Mat  And certain Pharisees came to him testing him and saying Is it right for a man to put away his wife for every cause
Mat  And he said in answer Have you not seen in the Writings that he who made them at the first made them male and female and said
Mat  For this cause will a man go away from his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two will become one flesh
Mat  So that they are no longer two but one flesh Then let not that which has been joined by God be parted by man
Mat  They say to him Why then did Moses give orders that a husband might give her a statement in writing and be free from her
Mat  He says to them Moses because of your hard hearts let you put away your wives but it has not been so from the first
Mat  And I say to you Whoever puts away his wife for any other cause than the loss of her virtue and takes another is a false husband and he who takes her as his wife when she is put away is no true husband to her
Mat  The disciples say to him If this is the position of a man in relation to his wife it is better not to be married
Mat  But he said to them Not all men are able to take in this saying but only those to whom it is given
Mat  For there are men who from birth were without sex and there are some who were made so by men and there are others who have made themselves so for the kingdom of heaven He who is able to take it let him take it
Mat  Then some people took little children to him so that he might put his hands on them in blessing and the disciples said sharp words to them
Mat  But Jesus said Let the little ones come to me and do not keep them away for of such is the kingdom of heaven
Mat  And he put his hands on them and went away
Mat  And one came to him and said Master what good thing have I to do so that I may have eternal life
Mat  And he said to him Why are you questioning me about what is good One there is who is good but if you have a desire to go into life keep the rules of the law
Mat  He says to him Which And Jesus said Do not put anyone to death Do not be untrue in married life Do not take what is not yours Do not give false witness
Mat  Give honour to your father and your mother and Have love for your neighbour as for yourself
Mat  The young man says to him All these things have I done what more is there
Mat  Jesus said to him If you have a desire to be complete go get money for your property and give it to the poor and you will have wealth in heaven and come after me
Mat  But hearing these words the young man went away sorrowing for he had much property
Mat  And Jesus said to his disciples Truly I say to you It is hard for a man with much money to go into the kingdom of heaven
Mat  And again I say to you It is simpler for a camel to go through a needles eye than for a man with much money to go into the kingdom of God
Mat  And the disciples hearing this were greatly surprised saying Who then may have salvation
Mat  And Jesus looking at them said With men this is not possible but with God all things are possible
Mat  Then Peter said to him See we have given up everything and have come after you what then will we have
Mat  And Jesus said to them Truly I say to you that in the time when all things are made new and the Son of man is seated in his glory you who have come after me will be seated on twelve seats judging the twelve tribes of Israel
Mat  And everyone who has given up houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or child or land for my name will be given a hundred times as much and have eternal life
Mat  But a great number who are first will be last and some who are last will be first
Mat  For the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a house who went out early in the morning to get workers into his vinegarden
Mat  And when he had made an agreement with the workmen for a penny a day he sent them into his vinegarden
Mat  And he went out about the third hour and saw others in the marketplace doing nothing
Mat  And he said to them Go into the vinegarden with the others and whatever is right I will give you And they went to work
Mat  Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour and did the same
Mat  And about the eleventh hour he went out and saw others doing nothing and he says to them Why are you here all the day doing nothing
Mat  They say to him Because no man has given us work He says to them Go in with the rest into the vinegarden
Mat  And when evening came the lord of the vinegarden said to his manager Let the workers come and give them their payment from the last to the first
Mat  And when those men came who had gone to work at the eleventh hour they were given every man a penny
Mat  Then those who came first had the idea that they would get more and they like the rest were given a penny
Mat  And when they got it they made a protest against the master of the house
Mat  Saying These last have done only one hours work and you have made them equal to us who have undergone the hard work of the day and the burning heat
Mat  But he in answer said to one of them Friend I do you no wrong did you not make an agreement with me for a penny
Mat  Take what is yours and go away it is my pleasure to give to this last even as to you
Mat  Have I not the right to do as seems good to me in my house or is your eye evil because I am good
Mat  So the last will be first and the first last
Mat  And when Jesus was going up to Jerusalem he took the twelve disciples on one side and said to them
Mat  See we go up to Jerusalem and the Son of man will be given into the hands of the chief priests and scribes and they will give orders for him to be put to death
Mat  And will give him up to the Gentiles to be made sport of and to be whipped and to be put to death on the cross and the third day he will come back again from the dead
Mat  Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons giving him worship and making a request of him
Mat  And he said to her What is your desire She says to him Let my two sons be seated the one at your right hand and the other at your left in your kingdom
Mat  But Jesus made answer and said You have no idea what you are requesting Are you able to take of the cup which I am about to take
Mat  They say to him We are able He says to them Truly you will take of my cup but to be seated at my right hand and at my left is not for me to give but it is for those for whom my Father has made it ready
Mat  And when it came to the ears of the ten they were angry with the two brothers
Mat  But Jesus said to them You see that the rulers of the Gentiles are lords over them and their great ones have authority over them
Mat  Let it not be so among you but if anyone has a desire to become great among you let him be your servant
Mat  And whoever has a desire to be first among you let him take the lowest place
Mat  Even as the Son of man did not come to have servants but to be a servant and to give his life for the salvation of men
Mat  And when they were going out from Jericho a great number went after him
Mat  And two blind men seated by the wayside when they had the news that Jesus was going by gave a loud cry saying Lord Son of David have mercy on us
Mat  And the people gave them orders to be quiet but they went on crying even louder Lord Son of David have mercy on us
Mat  And Jesus stopping sent for them and said What would you have me do to you
Mat  They say to him Lord that our eyes may be open
Mat  And Jesus being moved with pity put his fingers on their eyes and straight away they were able to see and went after him
Mat  And when they were near Jerusalem and had come to Bethphage to the Mountain of Olives Jesus sent two disciples
Mat  Saying to them Go into the little town in front of you and straight away you will see an ass with a cord round her neck and a young one with her let them loose and come with them to me
Mat  And if anyone says anything to you you will say The Lord has need of them and straight away he will send them
Mat  Now this took place so that these words of the prophet might come true
Mat  Say to the daughter of Zion See your King comes to you gentle and seated on an ass and on a young ass
Mat  And the disciples went and did as Jesus had given them orders
Mat  And got the ass and the young one and put their clothing on them and he took his seat on it
Mat  And all the people put their clothing down in the way and others got branches from the trees and put them down in the way
Mat  And those who went before him and those who came after gave loud cries saying Glory to the Son of David A blessing on him who comes in the name of the Lord Glory in the highest
Mat  And when he came into Jerusalem all the town was moved saying Who is this
Mat  And the people said This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee
Mat  And Jesus went into the Temple and sent out all who were trading there overturning the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of those trading in doves
Mat  And he said to them It is in the Writings My house is to be named a house of prayer but you are making it a hole of thieves
Mat  And the blind and the broken in body came to him in the Temple and he made them well
Mat  But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the works of power which he did and the children crying out in the Temple Glory to the son of David they were angry and said to him
Mat  Have you any idea what these are saying And Jesus said to them Yes have you not seen in the Writings From the lips of children and babies at the breast you have made your praise complete
Mat  And he went away from them and went out of the town to Bethany and was there for the night
Mat  Now in the morning when he was coming back to the town he had a desire for food
Mat  And seeing a figtree by the wayside he came to it and saw nothing on it but leaves only and he said to it Let there be no fruit from you from this time forward for ever And straight away the figtree became dry and dead
Mat  And when the disciples saw it they were surprised saying How did the figtree become dry in so short a time
Mat  And Jesus in answer said to them Truly I say to you If you have faith without doubting not only may you do what has been done to the figtree but even if you say to this mountain Be taken up and put into the sea it will be done
Mat  And all things whatever you make request for in prayer having faith you will get
Mat  And when he had come into the Temple the chief priests and those in authority over the people came to him while he was teaching and said By what authority do you do these things and who gave you this authority
Mat  And Jesus said to them in answer I will put one question to you and if you give me the answer I will say by what authority I do these things
Mat  The baptism of John where did it come from from heaven or from men And they were reasoning among themselves saying If we say From heaven he will say to us Why then did you not have faith in him
Mat  But if we say From men we are in fear of the people because all take John to be a prophet
Mat  And they made answer and said We have no idea Then he said to them And I will not say to you by what authority I do these things
Mat  But how does it seem to you A man had two sons and he came to the first and said Son go and do work today in the vinegarden
Mat  And he said in answer I will not but later changing his decision he went
Mat  And he came to the second and said the same And he made answer and said I go sir and went not
Mat  Which of the two did his fathers pleasure They say The first Jesus said to them Truly I say to you that taxfarmers and loose women are going into the kingdom of God before you
Mat  For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you had no faith in him but the taxfarmers and the loose women had faith in him and you when you saw it did not even have regret for your sins so as to have faith in him
Mat  Give ear to another story A master of a house made a vine garden and put a wall round it and made a place for crushing out the wine and made a tower and let it out to fieldworkers and went into another country
Mat  And when the time for the fruit came near he sent his servants to the workmen to get the fruit
Mat  And the workmen made an attack on his servants giving blows to one putting another to death and stoning another
Mat  Again he sent other servants more in number than the first and they did the same to them
Mat  But after that he sent his son to them saying They will have respect for my son
Mat  But when the workmen saw the son they said among themselves This is he who will one day be the owner of the property come let us put him to death and take his heritage
Mat  And they took him and driving him out of the vinegarden put him to death
Mat  When then the lord of the vinegarden comes what will he do to those workmen
Mat  They say to him He will put those cruel men to a cruel death and will let out the vinegarden to other workmen who will give him the fruit when it is ready
Mat  Jesus says to them Did you never see in the Writings The stone which the builders put on one side the same has been made the chief stone of the building this was the Lords doing and it is a wonder in our eyes
Mat  For this reason I say to you The kingdom of God will be taken away from you and will be given to a nation producing the fruits of it
Mat  Any man falling on this stone will be broken but he on whom it comes down will be crushed to dust
Mat  And when his stories came to the ears of the chief priests and the Pharisees they saw that he was talking of them
Mat  And though they had a desire to take him they were in fear of the people because in their eyes he was a prophet
Mat  And Jesus talking to them again in stories said
Mat  The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who made a feast when his son was married
Mat  And sent out his servants to get in the guests to the feast and they would not come
Mat  Again he sent out other servants with orders to say to the guests See I have made ready my feast my oxen and my fat beasts have been put to death and all things are ready come to the feast
Mat  But they gave no attention and went about their business one to his farm another to his trade
Mat  And the rest put violent hands on his servants and did evil to them and put them to death
Mat  But the king was angry and he sent his armies and those who had put his servants to death he gave to destruction burning down their town with fire
Mat  Then he said to his servants The feast is ready but the guests were not good enough
Mat  Go then to the crossroads and get all those whom you see to come to the bridefeast
Mat  And those servants went out into the streets and got together all those whom they came across bad and good and the feast was full of guests
Mat  But when the king came in to see the guests he saw there a man who had not on a guests robe
Mat  And he says to him Friend how came you in here not having a guests robe And he had nothing to say
Mat  Then the king said to the servants Put cords round his hands and feet and put him out into the dark there will be weeping and cries of sorrow
Mat  For out of all to whom the good news has come only a small number will get salvation
Mat  Then the Pharisees went and had a meeting to see how they might make use of his words to take him
Mat  And they sent to him their disciples with the Herodians saying Master we see that you are true and that you are teaching the true way of God and have no fear of anyone because you have no respect for a mans position
Mat  Give us then your opinion of this Is it right to give tax to Caesar or not
Mat  But Jesus saw their trick and said Oh false ones why are you attempting to put me in the wrong
Mat  Let me see the tax money And they gave him a penny
Mat  And he said to them Whose is this image and name on it
Mat  They say to him Caesars Then he said to them Give to Caesar the things which are Caesars and to God the things which are Gods
Mat  And hearing it they were full of wonder and went away from him
Mat  On the same day there came to him the Sadducees who say that there is no coming back from the dead and they put a question to him saying
Mat  Master Moses said If a man at the time of his death has no children let his brother take his wife and get a family for his brother
Mat  Now there were among us seven brothers and the first was married and at his death having no seed gave his wife to his brother
Mat  In the same way the second and the third up to the seventh
Mat  And last of all the woman came to her end
Mat  When they come back from the dead then whose wife will she be of the seven because they all had her
Mat  But Jesus said to them in answer You are in error not having knowledge of the Writings or of the power of God
Mat  For when they come back from the dead there are no husbands and wives but they are as the angels in heaven
Mat  But about the dead coming back to life have you no knowledge of what was said to you by God in the Writings
Mat  I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob God is not the God of the dead but of the living
Mat  And the people hearing it were surprised at his teaching
Mat  But the Pharisees hearing how the mouths of the Sadducees had been stopped came together
Mat  And one of them a teacher of the law put a question to him testing him and saying
Mat  Master which is the chief rule in the law
Mat  And he said to him Have love for the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind
Mat  This is the first and greatest rule
Mat  And a second like it is this Have love for your neighbour as for yourself
Mat  On these two rules all the law and the prophets are based
Mat  Now while the Pharisees were together Jesus put a question to them saying
Mat  What is your opinion of the Christ whose son is he They say to him The Son of David
Mat  He says to them How then does David in the Spirit give him the name of Lord saying
Mat  The Lord said to my Lord Be seated at my right hand till I put under your feet all those who are against you
Mat  If David then gives him the name of Lord how is he his son
Mat  And no one was able to give him an answer and so great was their fear of him that from that day no one put any more questions to him
Mat  Then Jesus said to the people and to his disciples
Mat  The scribes and the Pharisees have the authority of Moses
Mat  All things then which they give you orders to do these do and keep but do not take their works as your example for they say and do not
Mat  They make hard laws and put great weights on mens backs but they themselves will not put a finger to them
Mat  But all their works they do so as to be seen by men for they make wide their phylacteries and the edges of their robes
Mat  And the things desired by them are the first places at feasts and the chief seats in the Synagogues
Mat  And words of respect in the marketplaces and to be named by men Teacher
Mat  But you may not be named Teacher for one is your teacher and you are all brothers
Mat  And give no man the name of father on earth because one is your Father who is in heaven
Mat  And you may not be named guides because one is your Guide even Christ
Mat  But let the greatest among you be your servant
Mat  And whoever makes himself high will be made low and whoever makes himself low will be made high
Mat  But a curse is on you scribes and Pharisees false ones because you are shutting the kingdom of heaven against men for you do not go in yourselves and those who are going in you keep back
Mat  
Mat  A curse is on you scribes and Pharisees false ones for you go about land and sea to get one disciple and having him you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves
Mat  A curse is on you blind guides who say Whoever takes an oath by the Temple it is nothing but whoever takes an oath by the gold of the Temple he is responsible
Mat  You foolish ones and blind which is greater the gold or the Temple which makes the gold holy
Mat  And Whoever takes an oath by the altar it is nothing but whoever takes an oath by the offering which is on it he is responsible
Mat  You blind ones which is greater the offering or the altar which makes the offering holy
Mat  He then who takes an oath by the altar takes it by the altar and by all things on it
Mat  And he who takes an oath by the Temple takes it by the Temple and by him whose house it is
Mat  And he who takes an oath by heaven takes it by the seat of God and by him who is seated on it
Mat  A curse is on you scribes and Pharisees false ones for you make men give a tenth of all sorts of sweetsmelling plants but you give no thought to the more important things of the law righteousness and mercy and faith but it is right for you to do these and not to let the others be undone
Mat  You blind guides who take out a fly from your drink but make no trouble over a camel
Mat  A curse is on you scribes and Pharisees false ones for you make clean the outside of the cup and of the plate but inside they are full of violent behaviour and uncontrolled desire
Mat  You blind Pharisee first make clean the inside of the cup and of the plate so that the outside may become equally clean
Mat  A curse is on you scribes and Pharisees false ones for you are like the restingplaces of the dead which are made white and seem beautiful on the outside but inside are full of dead mens bones and of all unclean things
Mat  Even so you seem to men to be full of righteousness but inside you are all false and full of wrongdoing
Mat  A curse is on you scribes and Pharisees false ones because you put up buildings for housing the dead bodies of the prophets and make fair the last restingplaces of good men and say
Mat  If we had been living in the days of our fathers we would not have taken part with them in the blood of the prophets
Mat  So that you are witnesses against yourselves that you are the sons of those who put the prophets to death
Mat  Make full then the measure of your fathers
Mat  You snakes offspring of snakes how will you be kept from the punishment of hell
Mat  For this reason I send you prophets and wise men and scribes some of them you will put to death and put on the cross and to some of them you will give blows in your Synagogues driving them from town to town
Mat  So that on you may come all the blood of the upright on the earth from the blood of upright Abel to the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah whom you put to death between the Temple and the altar
Mat  Truly I say to you All these things will come on this generation
Mat  O Jerusalem Jerusalem putting to death the prophets and stoning those who are sent to her Again and again would I have taken your children to myself as a bird takes her young ones under her wings and you would not
Mat  See your house is made waste
Mat  For I say to you You will not see me from this time till you say A blessing on him who comes in the name of the Lord
Mat  And Jesus went out of the Temple and on the way his disciples came to him pointing out the buildings of the Temple
Mat  But he answering said to them See you not all these things truly I say to you that here there will not be one stone resting on another which will not be pulled down
Mat  And while he was seated on the Mountain of Olives the disciples came to him privately saying Make clear to us when will these things be and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the world
Mat  And Jesus said to them in answer Take care that you are not tricked
Mat  For people will come in my name saying I am the Christ and a number will be turned from the true way through them
Mat  And news will come to you of wars and talk of wars do not be troubled for these things have to be but it is still not the end
Mat  For nation will be moved against nation and kingdom against kingdom and men will be without food and the earth will be shaking in different places
Mat  But all these things are the first of the troubles
Mat  Then they will be cruel to you and will put you to death and you will be hated by all nations because of my name
Mat  And numbers of people will be turned from the right way and will give one another up and have hate for one another
Mat  And a number of false prophets will come causing error
Mat  And because wrongdoing will be increased the love of most people will become cold
Mat  But he who goes through to the end will get salvation
Mat  And this good news of the kingdom will be given through all the world for a witness to all nations and then the end will come
Mat  When then you see in the holy place the unclean thing which makes destruction of which word was given by Daniel the prophet let this be clear to the reader
Mat  Then let those who are in Judaea go in flight to the mountains
Mat  Let not him who is on the housetop go down to take anything out of his house
Mat  And let not him who is in the field go back to get his coat
Mat  But it will be hard for women who are with child and for those with babies at the breast in those days
Mat  And say a prayer that your flight may not be in the winter or on a Sabbath
Mat  Because in those days there will be great sorrow such as there has not been from the start of the world till now or ever will be
Mat  And if those days had not been made short there would have been no salvation for any but because of the saints those days will be made short
Mat  Then if any man says to you See here is the Christ or Here do not put faith in him
Mat  For there will come up false Christs and false prophets who will do great signs and wonders so that if possible even the saints might be tricked
Mat  See I have made it clear to you before it comes about
Mat  If then they say to you See he is in the waste land go not out See he is in the inner rooms put no faith in it
Mat  Because as in a thunderstorm the bright light coming from the east is seen even in the west so will be the coming of the Son of man
Mat  Wherever the dead body is there will the eagles come together
Mat  But straight away after the trouble of those days the sun will be made dark and the moon will not give her light and the stars will come down from heaven and the powers of heaven will be moved
Mat  And then the sign of the Son of man will be seen in heaven and then all the nations of the earth will have sorrow and they will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory
Mat  And he will send out his angels with a great sound of a horn and they will get his saints together from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other
Mat  Now take an example from the figtree when her branch has become soft and puts out its leaves you are certain that the summer is near
Mat  Even so when you see all these things you may be certain that he is near even at the doors
Mat  Truly I say to you This generation will not come to an end till all these things are complete
Mat  Heaven and earth will come to an end but my words will not come to an end
Mat  But of that day and hour no one has knowledge not even the angels in heaven or the Son but the Father only
Mat  And as were the days of Noah so will be the coming of the Son of man
Mat  Because as in those days before the overflowing of the waters they were feasting and taking wives and getting married till the day when Noah went into the ark
Mat  And they had no care till the waters came and took them all away so will be the coming of the Son of man
Mat  Then two men will be in the field one is taken and one let go
Mat  Two women will be crushing grain one is taken and one let go
Mat  Be watching then for you have no knowledge on what day your Lord will come
Mat  But be certain of this that if the master of the house had had knowledge of the time when the thief was coming he would have been watching and would not have let his house be broken into
Mat  Be ready then for at a time which you have no thought of the Son of man will come
Mat  Who is the true and wise servant whom his lord has put over those in his house to give them their food at the right time
Mat  A blessing on that servant who will be doing so when his lord comes
Mat  Truly I say to you he will put him over all he has
Mat  But if that evil servant says in his heart My lord is a long time in coming
Mat  And is cruel to the other servants taking his pleasure with those who are overcome with wine
Mat  The lord of that servant will come in a day when he is not looking for him and in an hour of which he has no knowledge
Mat  And will have him cut in two and will give him a part in the fate of the false ones there will be weeping and cries of sorrow
Mat  Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins the friends of the bride who took their lights and went out with the purpose of meeting the husband
Mat  And five of them were foolish and five were wise
Mat  For the foolish when they took their lights took no oil with them
Mat  But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lights
Mat  Now the husband was a long time in coming and they all went to sleep
Mat  But in the middle of the night there is a cry The husband comes Go out to him
Mat  Then all those virgins got up and made ready their lights
Mat  And the foolish said to the wise Give us of your oil for our lights are going out
Mat  But the wise made answer saying There may not be enough for us and you it would be better for you to go to the traders and get oil for yourselves
Mat  And while they went to get oil the master came and those who were ready went in with him to the feast and the door was shut
Mat  After that the other virgins came saying Lord Lord let us in
Mat  But he made answer and said Truly I say to you I have no knowledge of you
Mat  Keep watch then because you are not certain of the day or of the hour
Mat  For it is as when a man about to take a journey got his servants together and gave them his property
Mat  And to one he gave five talents to another two to another one to everyone as he was able and he went on his journey
Mat  Straight away he who had been given the five talents went and did trade with them and made five more
Mat  In the same way he who had been given the two got two more
Mat  But he who was given the one went away and put it in a hole in the earth and kept his lords money in a secret place
Mat  Now after a long time the lord of those servants comes and makes up his account with them
Mat  And he who had the five talents came with his other five talents saying Lord you gave into my care five talents see I have got five more
Mat  His lord said to him Well done good and true servant you have been true in a small thing I will give you control over great things take your part in the joy of your lord
Mat  And he who had the two talents came and said Lord you gave into my care two talents see I have got two more
Mat  His lord said to him Well done good and true servant you have been true in a small thing I will give you control over great things take your part in the joy of your lord
Mat  And he who had had the one talent came and said Lord I had knowledge that you are a hard man getting in grain where you have not put seed and making profits for which you have done no work
Mat  And I was in fear and went away and put your talent in the earth here is what is yours
Mat  But his lord in answer said to him You are a bad and unready servant if you had knowledge that I get in grain where I did not put seed and make profits for which I have done no work
Mat  Why then did you not put my money in the bank and at my coming I would have got back what is mine with interest
Mat  Take away then his talent and give it to him who has the ten talents
Mat  For to everyone who has will be given and he will have more but from him who has not even what he has will be taken away
Mat  And put out the servant who is of no profit into the outer dark there will be weeping and cries of sorrow
Mat  But when the Son of man comes in his glory and all the angels with him then will he be seated in his glory
Mat  And before him all the nations will come together and they will be parted one from another as the sheep are parted from the goats by the keeper
Mat  And he will put the sheep on his right but the goats on the left
Mat  Then will the King say to those on his right Come you who have the blessing of my Father into the kingdom made ready for you before the world was
Mat  For I was in need of food and you gave it to me I was in need of drink and you gave it to me I was wandering and you took me in
Mat  I had no clothing and you gave it to me when I was ill or in prison you came to me
Mat  Then will the upright make answer to him saying Lord when did we see you in need of food and give it to you or in need of drink and give it to you
Mat  And when did we see you wandering and take you in or without clothing and give it to you
Mat  And when did we see you ill or in prison and come to you
Mat  And the King will make answer and say to them Truly I say to you Because you did it to the least of these my brothers you did it to me
Mat  Then will he say to those on the left Go from me you cursed ones into the eternal fire which is ready for the Evil One and his angels
Mat  For I was in need of food and you gave it not to me I was in need of drink and you gave it not to me
Mat  I was wandering and you took me not in without clothing and you gave me no clothing ill and in prison and you came not to me
Mat  Then will they make answer saying Lord when did we see you in need of food or drink or wandering or without clothing or ill or in prison and did not take care of you
Mat  Then will he make answer to them saying Truly I say to you Because you did it not to the least of these you did it not to me
Mat  And these will go away into eternal punishment but the upright into eternal life
Mat  And when Jesus had come to the end of all these words he said to his disciples
Mat  After two days is the Passover and the Son of man will be given up to the death of the cross
Mat  Then the chief priests and the rulers of the people came together in the house of the high priest who was named Caiaphas
Mat  And they made designs together to take Jesus by some trick and put him to death
Mat  But they said Not while the feast is going on for fear of trouble among the people
Mat  Now when Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper
Mat  There came to him a woman having a bottle of perfume of great price and she put the perfume on his head when he was seated at table
Mat  But when the disciples saw it they were angry saying To what purpose is this waste
Mat  For we might have got much money for this and given it to the poor
Mat  But Jesus seeing it said to them Why are you troubling the woman she has done a kind act to me
Mat  For the poor you have ever with you but me you have not for ever
Mat  For in putting this perfume on my body she did it to make me ready for my last restingplace
Mat  Truly I say to you Wherever this good news goes out in all the world what this woman has done will be talked of in memory of her
Mat  Then one of the twelve who was named Judas Iscariot went to the chief priests and said
Mat  What will you give me if I give him up to you And the price was fixed at thirty bits of silver
Mat  And from that time he was watching for a chance to give him into their hands
Mat  Now on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus saying Where are we to make ready for you to take the Passover meal
Mat  And he said to them Go into the town to such a man and say to him The Master says My time is near I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples
Mat  And the disciples did as Jesus had said to them and they made ready the Passover
Mat  Now when evening was come he was seated at table with the twelve disciples
Mat  And while they were taking food he said Truly I say to you that one of you will be false to me
Mat  And they were very said and said to him one by one Is it I Lord
Mat  And he made answer and said He who puts his hand into the plate with me the same will be false to me
Mat  The Son of man goes even as the Writings say of him but a curse is on that man through whom the Son of man is given up it would have been well for that man if he had never come into the world
Mat  And Judas who was false to him made answer and said Is it I Master He says to him Yes
Mat  And when they were taking food Jesus took bread and after blessing it he gave the broken bread to the disciples and said Take it this is my body
Mat  And he took a cup and having given praise he gave it to them saying
Mat  Take of it all of you for this is my blood of the testament which is given for men for the forgiveness of sins
Mat  But I say to you that from now I will not take of this fruit of the vine till that day when I take it new with you in my Fathers kingdom
Mat  And after a song of praise to God they went out to the Mountain of Olives
Mat  Then said Jesus to them All of you will be turned away from me this night for it is said in the Writings I will put to death the keeper of the sheep and the sheep of the flock will be put to flight
Mat  But after I am come back from the dead I will go before you into Galilee
Mat  But Peter made answer and said to him Though all may be turned away from you I will never be turned away
Mat  Jesus said to him Truly I say to you that this night before the hour of the cocks cry you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me
Mat  Peter says to him Even if I am put to death with you I will not be false to you So said all the disciples
Mat  Then comes Jesus with them to a place named Gethsemane and says to his disciples Be seated here while I go over there for prayer
Mat  And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and became sad and very troubled
Mat  Then says he to them My soul is very sad even to death keep watch with me here
Mat  And he went forward a little and falling down on his face in prayer he said O my Father if it is possible let this cup go from me but let not my pleasure but yours be done
Mat  And he comes to the disciples and sees that they are sleeping and says to Peter What were you not able to keep watch with me one hour
Mat  Keep watch with prayer so that you may not be put to the test the spirit truly is ready but the flesh is feeble
Mat  Again a second time he went away and said in prayer O my Father if this may not go from me without my taking it let your pleasure be done
Mat  And he came again and saw them sleeping for their eyes were tired
Mat  And he went away from them again and a third time said the same prayer
Mat  Then he comes to the disciples and says to them Go on sleeping now and take your rest for the hour is come and the Son of man is given into the hands of evil men
Mat  Up let us be going see he who gives me up is near
Mat  And while he was still talking Judas one of the twelve came and with him a band armed with swords and sticks from the chief priests and those in authority over the people
Mat  Now the false one had given them a sign saying The one to whom I give a kiss that is he take him
Mat  And straight away he came to Jesus and said Master and gave him a kiss
Mat  And Jesus said to him Friend do that for which you have come Then they came and put hands on Jesus and took him
Mat  And one of those who were with Jesus put out his hand and took out his sword and gave the servant of the high priest a blow cutting off his ear
Mat  Then says Jesus to him Put up your sword again into its place for all those who take the sword will come to death by the sword
Mat  Does it not seem possible to you that if I make request to my Father he will even now send me an army of angels
Mat  But how then would the Writings come true which say that so it has to be
Mat  In that hour Jesus said to the people Have you come out as against a thief with swords and sticks to take me I was teaching every day in the Temple and you took me not
Mat  But all this has taken place so that the writings of the prophets might come true Then all his disciples went from him in flight
Mat  And those who had made Jesus prisoner took him away to the house of Caiaphas the high priest where the scribes and those in authority over the people had come together
Mat  But Peter went after him at a distance to the house of the high priest and went in and took his seat with the servants to see the end
Mat  Now the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin were looking for false witness against Jesus so that they might put him to death
Mat  And they were not able to get it though a number of false witnesses came
Mat  But later there came two who said This man said I am able to give the Temple of God to destruction and to put it up again in three days
Mat  And the high priest got up and said to him Have you no answer what is it which these say against you
Mat  But Jesus said not a word And the high priest said to him I put you on oath by the living God that you will say to us if you are the Christ the Son of God
Mat  Jesus says to him You say so but I say to you From now you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven
Mat  Then the high priest violently parting his robes said He has said evil against God what more need have we of witnesses for now his words against God have come to your ears
Mat  What is your opinion They made answer and said It is right for him to be put to death
Mat  Then they put shame on him and were cruel to him and some gave him blows saying
Mat  Be a prophet O Christ and say who gave you a blow
Mat  Now Peter was seated in the open square outside the house and a servantgirl came to him saying You were with Jesus the Galilaean
Mat  But he said before them all that it was false saying I have no knowledge of what you say
Mat  And when he had gone out into the doorway another saw him and says to those who were there This man was with Jesus the Nazarene
Mat  And again he said with an oath I have no knowledge of the man
Mat  And after a little time those who were near came and said to Peter Truly you are one of them because your talk is witness against you
Mat  Then with curses and oaths he said I have no knowledge of the man And straight away there came the cry of a cock
Mat  And the word of Jesus came back to Peter when he said Before the hour of the cocks cry you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me And he went out weeping bitterly
Mat  Now when it was morning all the chief priests and those in authority took thought together with the purpose of putting Jesus to death
Mat  And they put cords on him and took him away and gave him up to Pilate the ruler
Mat  Then Judas who was false to him seeing that he was to be put to death in his regret took back the thirty bits of silver to the chief priests and those in authority
Mat  Saying I have done wrong in giving into your hands an upright man But they said What is that to us it is your business
Mat  And he put down the silver in the Temple and went out and put himself to death by hanging
Mat  And the chief priests took the silver and said It is not right to put it in the Temple store for it is the price of blood
Mat  And they made a decision to get with the silver the potters field as a place for the dead of other countries
Mat  For this cause that field was named The field of blood to this day
Mat  Then came true that which was said by Jeremiah the prophet And they took the thirty bits of silver the price of him who was valued by the children of Israel
Mat  And they gave them for the potters field as I had word from the Lord
Mat  And Jesus was before the ruler who put a question to him Are you the King of the Jews And Jesus said to him You say so
Mat  But when the chief priests and those in authority made statements against him he gave no answer
Mat  Then says Pilate to him Do you give no attention to what their witnesses say against you
Mat  And he gave him no answer not even a word so that the ruler was greatly surprised
Mat  Now at the feast it was the way for the ruler to let free to the people one prisoner at their selection
Mat  And they had then an important prisoner whose name was Barabbas
Mat  So when they came together Pilate said to them Whom will you have Barabbas or Jesus who is named Christ
Mat  For he saw that for envy they had given him up
Mat  And while he was on the judges seat his wife sent to him saying Have nothing to do with that upright man for I have had much trouble this day in a dream because of him
Mat  Now the chief priests and those in authority got the people to make request for Barabbas and for Jesus to be put to death
Mat  But the ruler made answer and said to them Which of the two is it your pleasure that I let go free And they said Barabbas
Mat  Pilate says to them What then am I to do with Jesus who is named Christ They all say Let him be put to death on the cross
Mat  And he said Why what evil has he done But they gave loud cries saying To the cross with him
Mat  So when Pilate saw that he was able to do nothing but that trouble was working up he took water and washing his hands before the people said The blood of this upright man is not on my hands you are responsible
Mat  And all the people made answer and said Let his blood be on us and on our children
Mat  Then he let Barabbas go free but after having Jesus whipped he gave him up to be put to death on the cross
Mat  Then the rulers armed men took Jesus into the open square and got all their band together
Mat  And they took off his clothing and put on him a red robe
Mat  And they made a crown of thorns and put it on his head and put a rod in his right hand and they went down on their knees before him and made sport of him saying Long life to the King of the Jews
Mat  And they put shame on him and gave him blows on the head with the rod
Mat  And when they had made sport of him they took the robe off him and put his clothing on him and took him away to put him on the cross
Mat  And while they were coming out they saw a man of Cyrene Simon by name and they made him go with them so that he might take up his cross
Mat  And when they came to the place named Golgotha that is to say Dead Mans Head
Mat  They gave him wine mixed with bitter drink and after tasting it he took no more
Mat  And when they had put him on the cross they made division of his clothing among them by the decision of chance
Mat  And they were seated there watching him
Mat  And they put up over his head the statement of his crime in writing THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS
Mat  Then two thieves were put on crosses with him one on the right and one on the left
Mat  And those who went by said bitter words to him shaking their heads and saying
Mat  You who would give the Temple to destruction and put it up again in three days get yourself free if you are the Son of God come down from the cross
Mat  In the same way the chief priests making sport of him with the scribes and those in authority said
Mat  A saviour of others he has no salvation for himself If he is the King of Israel let him now come down from the cross and we will have faith in him
Mat  He put his faith in God let God be his saviour now if he will have him for he said I am the Son of God
Mat  And the thieves who were on the crosses said evil words to him
Mat  Now from the sixth hour it was dark over all the land till the ninth hour
Mat  And about the ninth hour Jesus gave a loud cry saying Eli Eli lama sabachthani that is My God my God why are you turned away from me
Mat  And some of those who were near by hearing it said This man is crying to Elijah
Mat  And straight away one of them went quickly and took a sponge and made it full of bitter wine and put it on a rod and gave him drink
Mat  And the rest said Let him be let us see if Elijah will come to his help
Mat  And Jesus gave another loud cry and gave up his spirit
Mat  And the curtain of the Temple was parted in two from end to end and there was an earthshock and the rocks were broken
Mat  And the restingplaces of the dead came open and the bodies of a number of sleeping saints came to life
Mat  And coming out of their restingplaces after he had come again from the dead they went into the holy town and were seen by a number of people
Mat  Now the captain and those who were with him watching Jesus when they saw the earthshock and the things which were done were in great fear and said Truly this was a son of God
Mat  And a number of women were there watching from a distance who had come with Jesus from Galilee waiting on his needs
Mat  Among whom was Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joses and the mother of the sons of Zebedee
Mat  And in the evening there came a man of wealth from Arimathaea Joseph by name who was a disciple of Jesus
Mat  This man went in to Pilate and made a request for the body of Jesus Then Pilate gave orders for it to be given to him
Mat  And Joseph took the body folding it in clean linen
Mat  And put it in the restingplace which had been cut out of the rock for himself and after rolling a great stone to the door of it he went away
Mat  And Mary Magdalene was there and the other Mary seated by the place of the dead
Mat  Now on the day after the getting ready of the Passover the chief priests and Pharisees came together to Pilate
Mat  Saying Sir we have in mind how that false man said while he was still living After three days I will come again from the dead
Mat  Give orders then that the place where his body is may be made safe till the third day for fear that his disciples come and take him away secretly and say to the people He has come back from the dead and the last error will be worse than the first
Mat  Pilate said to them You have watchmen go and make it as safe as you are able
Mat  So they went and made safe the place where his body was putting a stamp on the stone and the watchmen were with them
Mat  Now late on the Sabbath when the dawn of the first day of the week was near Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the place where his body was
Mat  And there was a great earthshock for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and rolling back the stone took his seat on it
Mat  His form was shining like the light and his clothing was white as snow
Mat  And for fear of him the watchmen were shaking and became as dead men
Mat  And the angel said to the women Have no fear for I see that you are searching for Jesus who was put to death on the cross
Mat  He is not here for he has come to life again even as he said Come see the Lords restingplace
Mat  And go quickly and give his disciples the news that he has come back from the dead and is going before you into Galilee there you will see him as I have said to you
Mat  And they went away quickly with fear and great joy to give his disciples the news
Mat  And on the way Jesus came to them saying Be glad And they came and put their hands on his feet and gave him worship
Mat  Then said Jesus to them Have no fear go and give word to my brothers to go into Galilee and there they will see me
Mat  Now while they were going some of the watchmen came into the town and gave news to the chief priests of all the things which had taken place
Mat  And when they had come together with those in authority and had made their decision they gave much money to the watchmen saying
Mat  Say His disciples came by night and took him away secretly while we were sleeping
Mat  And if this comes to the rulers ears we will see that he does not make you responsible
Mat  So they took the money and did as they had been ordered and this account has been current among the Jews till the present time
Mat  But the eleven disciples went into Galilee to the mountain where Jesus had given them orders to go
Mat  And when they saw him they gave him worship but some were in doubt
Mat  And Jesus came to them and said All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth
Mat  Go then and make disciples of all the nations giving them baptism in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
Mat  Teaching them to keep all the rules which I have given you and see I am ever with you even to the end of the world
Mak  The first words of the good news of Jesus Christ the Son of God
Mak  Even as it is said in the book of Isaiah the prophet See I send my servant before your face who will make ready your way
Mak  The voice of one crying in the waste land Make ready the way of the Lord make his roads straight
Mak  John came and gave baptism in the waste land preaching baptism as a sign of forgiveness of sin for those whose hearts were changed
Mak  And there went out to him all the people of Judaea and all those of Jerusalem and they were given baptism by him in the river Jordan saying that they were sinners
Mak  And John was clothed in camels hair with a leather band about him and his food was locusts and honey
Mak  And he said to them all There is one coming after me who is greater than I whose shoes I am not good enough to undo
Mak  I have given you baptism with water but he will give you baptism with the Holy Spirit
Mak  And it came about in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was given baptism by John in the Jordan
Mak  And straight away coming up out of the water he saw the heavens broken open and the Spirit coming down on him as a dove
Mak  And a voice came out of heaven You are my dearly loved Son with whom I am well pleased
Mak  And straight away the Spirit sent him out into the waste land
Mak  And he was in the waste land for forty days being tested by Satan and he was with the beasts and the angels took care of him
Mak  Now after John had been put in prison Jesus came into Galilee preaching the good news of God
Mak  And saying The time has come and the kingdom of God is near let your hearts be turned from sin and have faith in the good news
Mak  And going by the sea of Galilee he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon putting a net into the sea for they were fishermen
Mak  And Jesus said to them Come after me and I will make you fishers of men
Mak  And they went straight from their nets and came after him
Mak  And going on a little farther he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother who were in their boat stitching up their nets
Mak  And he said Come after me and they went away from their father Zebedee who was in the boat with the servants and came after him
Mak  And they came to Capernaum and on the Sabbath he went into the Synagogue and gave teaching
Mak  And they were full of wonder at his teaching because he gave it as one having authority and not like the scribes
Mak  And there was in their Synagogue a man with an unclean spirit and he gave a cry
Mak  Saying What have we to do with you Jesus of Nazareth have you come to put an end to us I see well who you are the Holy One of God
Mak  And Jesus said to him sharply Be quiet and come out of him
Mak  And the unclean spirit shaking him violently and crying with a loud voice came out of him
Mak  And they were all greatly surprised so that they put questions to one another saying What is this a new teaching with authority he gives orders even to the unclean spirits and they do what he says
Mak  And news of him went out quickly everywhere into all parts of Galilee round about
Mak  And when they came out of the Synagogue they went into the house of Simon and Andrew with James and John
Mak  Now Simons wifes mother was ill with a burning heat and they gave him word of her
Mak  And he came and took her by the hand lifting her up and she became well and took care of their needs
Mak  And in the evening at sundown they took to him all who were diseased and those who had evil spirits
Mak  And all the town had come together at the door
Mak  And a number who were ill with different diseases he made well and sent out evil spirits but he did not let the evil spirits say anything because they had knowledge of him
Mak  And in the morning a long time before daylight he got up and went out to a quiet place and there he gave himself up to prayer
Mak  And Simon and those who were with him came after him
Mak  And when they came up with him they said to him Everyone is looking for you
Mak  And he said to them Let us go to other parts into the nearest towns so that I may give teaching there because for this purpose I came
Mak  And he went into their Synagogues in every part of Galilee preaching and driving out evil spirits
Mak  And a leper came to him and going down on his knees before him made a request saying If it is your pleasure you have the power to make me clean
Mak  And being moved with pity he put out his hand and touching him said to him It is my pleasure be made clean
Mak  And straight away the disease went from him and he was made clean
Mak  And he sent him away saying to him very sharply
Mak  See that you say nothing to any man but go and let the priest see you and make yourself clean by an offering of the things ordered by Moses for a witness to them
Mak  But he went out and made it public giving an account of it everywhere so that Jesus was no longer able to go openly into a town but was outside in the waste land and they came to him from every part
Mak  And when he came into Capernaum again after some days the news went about that he was in the house
Mak  And a great number had come together so that there was no longer room for them no not even about the door and he gave them teaching
Mak  And four men came to him with one on a bed who had no power of moving
Mak  And when they were unable to get near him because of all the people they got the roof uncovered where he was and when it was broken up they let down the bed on which the man was
Mak  And Jesus seeing their faith said to him Son you have forgiveness for your sins
Mak  But there were certain of the scribes seated there and reasoning in their hearts
Mak  Why does this man say such things he has no respect for God from whom does forgiveness come but from God only
Mak  And Jesus having knowledge in his spirit of their thoughts said to them Why are you reasoning about these things in your hearts
Mak  Which is the simpler to say to a man who is ill You have forgiveness for your sins or Get up take up your bed and go
Mak  But so that you may see that the Son of man has authority for the forgiveness of sins on earth he said to the man
Mak  I say to you Get up take up your bed and go to your house
Mak  And he got up and straight away took up the bed and went out before them all so that they were all full of wonder and gave glory to God saying We have never seen anything like this
Mak  And he went out again by the seaside and all the people came to him and he gave them teaching
Mak  And when he went by he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus seated at the place where taxes were taken and he said to him Come with me And he got up and went with him
Mak  And it came about that he was seated at meat in his house and a number of taxfarmers and sinners were at table with Jesus and his disciples for there were a great number of them and they came after him
Mak  And the scribes of the Pharisees when they saw that he was taking food with the taxfarmers and sinners said to his disciples Why does he take food and drink with such men
Mak  And Jesus hearing it said to them Those who are well have no need of a medical man but those who are ill I have come not to get the upright but sinners
Mak  And Johns disciples and the Pharisees were taking no food and they came and said to him Why do Johns disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees go without food but your disciples do not
Mak  And Jesus said to them Will the friends of a newlymarried man go without food while he is with them as long as they have him with them they will not go without food
Mak  But the days will come when the husband will be taken away from them and then they will go without food
Mak  No man puts a bit of new cloth on an old coat or the new by pulling away from the old makes a worse hole
Mak  And no man puts new wine into old wineskins or the skins will be burst by the wine and the wine and the skins will be wasted but new wine has to be put into new wineskins
Mak  And it came about that on the Sabbath day he was going through the grainfields and while they were walking his disciples took the heads of grain
Mak  And the Pharisees said to him Why are they doing what it is not right to do on the Sabbath
Mak  And he said to them Have you no knowledge of what David did when he had need and was without food he and those who were with him
Mak  How he went into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest and took for food the holy bread which only the priests may take and gave it to those who were with him
Mak  And he said to them The Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath
Mak  So that the Son of man is lord even of the Sabbath
Mak  And he went again into the Synagogue and there was a man there whose hand was dead
Mak  And they were watching him to see if he would make him well on the Sabbath day so that they might have something against him
Mak  And he said to the man Get up and come forward
Mak  And he said to them Is it right to do good on the Sabbath or to do evil to give life or to put to death But they said nothing
Mak  And looking round on them he was angry being sad because of their hard hearts and he said to the man Put out your hand And he put it out and his hand was made well
Mak  And the Pharisees went out and straight away made designs with the Herodians about how they might put him to death
Mak  And Jesus went away with his disciples to the sea and a great number from Galilee came after him and from Judaea
Mak  And from Jerusalem and from Idumaea and the other side of Jordan and the country about Tyre and Sidon a great number hearing what great things he did came to him
Mak  And he made a request to his disciples to have a little boat ready for him so that he might not be crushed by the people
Mak  For he had made such a great number well that all those who were diseased were falling down before him for the purpose of touching him
Mak  And the unclean spirits whenever they saw him went down before him crying out and saying You are the Son of God
Mak  And he gave them special orders not to say who he was
Mak  And he went up into the mountain and sent for those whom it was his pleasure to have with him and they went to him
Mak  And he took twelve to be with him so that he might send them out as preachers
Mak  And give them the power of driving out evil spirits
Mak  To Simon he gave the second name of Peter
Mak  And to James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James he gave the second name of Boanerges which is Sons of thunder
Mak  And Andrew and Philip and Bartholomew and Matthew and Thomas and James the son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus and Simon the Zealot
Mak  And Judas Iscariot who was false to him
Mak  And he went into a house And the people came together again so that they were not even able to take bread
Mak  And when his friends had news of it they went out to get him saying He is off his head
Mak  And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said He has Beelzebub and By the ruler of evil spirits he sends evil spirits out of men
Mak  And turning to them he said to them in the form of a story How is it possible for Satan to put out Satan
Mak  If there is division in a kingdom that kingdom will come to destruction
Mak  And if there is division in a house that house will come to destruction
Mak  And if Satan is at war with himself and there is division in him he will not keep his place but will come to an end
Mak  But no one is able to go into the house of the strong man and take his goods without first putting cords round the strong man and then he will take his goods
Mak  Truly I say to you The sons of men will have forgiveness for all their sins and for all the evil words they say
Mak  But whoever says evil things against the Holy Spirit will never have forgiveness but the evil he has done will be with him for ever
Mak  Because they said He has an unclean spirit
Mak  And his mother and brothers came and were outside and sent for him requesting to see him
Mak  And a great number were seated round him and they said to him See your mother and your brothers are outside looking for you
Mak  And he said in answer Who are my mother and my brothers
Mak  And looking round at those who were seated about him he said See my mother and my brothers
Mak  Whoever does Gods pleasure the same is my brother and sister and mother
Mak  And again he was teaching by the seaside And a very great number of people had come to him so that he got into a boat on the sea and took his seat and all the people were on the land by the seaside
Mak  And he gave them teaching about a number of things in the form of stories and said to them in his teaching Give ear
Mak  A man went out to put seed in the earth
Mak  And while he was doing it some was dropped by the wayside and the birds came and took it for food
Mak  And some went on the stones where it had not much earth and it came up straight away because the earth was not deep
Mak  And when the sun was high it was burned and because it had no root it became dry and dead
Mak  And some went among the thorns and the thorns came up and it had no room for growth and gave no fruit
Mak  And some falling on good earth gave fruit coming up and increasing and giving thirty sixty and a hundred times as much
Mak  And he said to them Whoever has ears let him give ear
Mak  And when he was by himself those who were round him with the twelve put questions to him about the purpose of the stories
Mak  And he said to them To you is given the secret of the kingdom of God but to those who are outside all things are given in the form of stories
Mak  So that seeing they may see and it will not be clear to them and hearing it they will not get the sense for fear that they may be turned again to me and have forgiveness
Mak  And he said to them If you are not clear about this story how will you be clear about the others
Mak  The seed is the word
Mak  And these are they by the wayside where the word is planted and when they have given ear the Evil One comes straight away and takes away the word which has been planted in them
Mak  And in the same way these are they who are planted on the stones who when the word has come to their ears straight away take it with joy
Mak  And they have no root in themselves but go on for a time then when trouble comes or pain because of the word they quickly become full of doubts
Mak  And others are those planted among the thorns these are they who have given ear to the word
Mak  And the cares of this life and the deceits of wealth and the desire for other things coming in put a stop to the growth of the word and it gives no fruit
Mak  And these are they who were planted on the good earth such as give ear to the word and take it into their hearts and give fruit thirty and sixty and a hundred times as much
Mak  And he said to them When the light comes in do people put it under a vessel or under the bed and not on its table
Mak  There is nothing covered which will not be seen openly and nothing has been made secret which will not come to light
Mak  If any man has ears let him give ear
Mak  And he said to them Take care what you give ear to in the same measure as you give you will get and more will be given to you
Mak  He who has to him will be given and he who has not from him will be taken even that which he has
Mak  And he said Such is the kingdom of God as if a man put seed in the earth
Mak  And went to sleep and got up night and day and the seed came to growth though he had no idea how
Mak  The earth gives fruit by herself first the leaf then the head then the full grain
Mak  But when the grain is ready he quickly sends men to get it cut because the time for cutting has come
Mak  And he said What picture may we give of the kingdom of God or with what story may we make it clear
Mak  It is like a grain of mustard seed which when it is put in the earth is smaller than all the seeds on the earth
Mak  But when it is planted it comes up and becomes taller than all the plants and puts out great branches so that the birds of heaven are able to take rest in its shade
Mak  And with a number of such stories he gave them his teaching as they were able to take it
Mak  And without a story he said nothing to them but privately to his disciples he made all things clear
Mak  And on that day when the evening had come he said to them Let us go over to the other side
Mak  And going away from the people they took him with them as he was in the boat And other boats were with him
Mak  And a great storm of wind came up and the waves came into the boat so that the boat was now becoming full
Mak  And he himself was in the back of the boat sleeping on the cushion and they awaking him said Master is it nothing to you that we are in danger of destruction
Mak  And he came out of his sleep and gave strong orders to the wind and said to the sea Peace be at rest And the wind went down and there was a great calm
Mak  And he said to them Why are you full of fear have you still no faith
Mak  And their fear was great and they said one to another Who then is this that even the wind and the sea do his orders
Mak  And they came to the other side of the sea into the country of the Gerasenes
Mak  And when he had got out of the boat straight away there came to him from the place of the dead a man with an unclean spirit
Mak  He was living in the place of the dead and no man was able to keep him down no not with a chain
Mak  Because he had frequently been prisoned in chains and iron bands and the chains had been parted and the bands broken by him and no man was strong enough to make him quiet
Mak  And all the time by day and by night in the place of the dead and in the mountains he was crying out and cutting himself with stones
Mak  And when he saw Jesus from far off he went quickly to him and gave him worship
Mak  And crying out with a loud voice he said What have I to do with you Jesus Son of the Most High God In Gods name do not be cruel to me
Mak  For Jesus had said to him Come out of the man you unclean spirit
Mak  And Jesus said What is your name And he made answer My name is Legion because there are a great number of us
Mak  And he made strong prayers to him not to send them away out of the country
Mak  Now on the mountain side there was a great herd of pigs getting their food
Mak  And they said to him Send us into the pigs so that we may go into them
Mak  And he let them do it And the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs and the herd went rushing down a sharp slope into the sea about two thousand of them and they came to their death in the sea
Mak  And their keepers went running and gave an account of it in the town and in the country And people came to see what had taken place
Mak  And they came to Jesus and saw the man in whom had been the evil spirits seated clothed and with full use of his senses and they were full of fear
Mak  And those who had seen it gave them an account of what had been done to him who had the evil spirits and of the fate of the pigs
Mak  And they made a request to him to go out of their country
Mak  And when he was getting into the boat the man in whom had been the evil spirits had a great desire to come with him
Mak  And he would not let him but said to him Go to your house to your friends and give them news of the great things the Lord has done for you and how he had mercy on you
Mak  And he went on his way and made public in the country of Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him and all men were full of wonder
Mak  And when Jesus had gone over again in the boat to the other side a great number of people came to him and he was by the sea
Mak  And one of the rulers of the Synagogue Jairus by name came and seeing him went down at his feet
Mak  And made strong prayers to him saying My little daughter is near to death it is my prayer that you will come and put your hands on her so that she may be made well and have life
Mak  And he went with him and a great number of people went after him and came round him
Mak  And a woman who had had a flow of blood for twelve years
Mak  And had undergone much at the hands of a number of medical men and had given all she had and was no better but even worse
Mak  When she had news of the things which Jesus did went among the people coming after him and put her hand on his robe
Mak  For she said If I may only put my hand on his robe I will be made well
Mak  And straight away the fountain of her blood was stopped and she had a feeling in her body that her disease had gone and she was well
Mak  And straight away Jesus was conscious that power had gone out of him and turning to the people he said Who was touching my robe
Mak  And his disciples said to him You see the people round you on every side and you say Who was touching me
Mak  And on his looking round to see her who had done this thing
Mak  The woman shaking with fear conscious of what had been done to her came and falling on her face before him gave him a true account of everything
Mak  And he said to her Daughter your faith has made you well go in peace and be free from your disease
Mak  And while he was still talking they came from the ruler of the Synagogues house saying Your daughter is dead why are you still troubling the Master
Mak  But Jesus giving no attention to their words said to the ruler of the Synagogue Have no fear only have faith
Mak  And he did not let anyone come with him but Peter and James and John the brother of James
Mak  And they came to the house of the ruler of the Synagogue and he saw people running this way and that and weeping and crying loudly
Mak  And when he had gone in he said to them Why are you making such a noise and weeping The child is not dead but sleeping
Mak  And they were laughing at him But he having sent them all out took the father of the child and her mother and those who were with him and went in where the child was
Mak  And taking her by the hand he said to her Talitha cumi which is My child I say to you Get up
Mak  And the young girl got up straight away and was walking about she being twelve years old And they were overcome with wonder
Mak  And he gave them special orders that they were not to say anything of this and he said that some food was to be given to her
Mak  And he went away from there and came into his country and his disciples went with him
Mak  And when the Sabbath day had come he was teaching in the Synagogue and a number of people hearing him were surprised saying From where did this man get these things and What is the wisdom given to this man and what are these works of power done by his hands
Mak  Is not this the woodworker the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon and are not his sisters here with us And they were bitter against him
Mak  And Jesus said to them A prophet is nowhere without honour but in his country and among his relations and in his family
Mak  And he was unable to do any work of power there but only to put his hands on one or two persons who were ill and make them well
Mak  And he was greatly surprised because they had no faith And he went about the country places teaching
Mak  And he gave orders to the twelve and sent them out two by two and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits
Mak  And he said that they were to take nothing for their journey but a stick only no bread no bag no money in their pockets
Mak  They were to go with common shoes on their feet and not to take two coats
Mak  And he said to them Wherever you go into a house make that your restingplace till you go away
Mak  And whatever place will not take you in and will not give ear to you when you go away put off the dust from your feet as a witness against them
Mak  And they went out preaching the need for a change of heart in men
Mak  And they sent out a number of evil spirits and put oil on a great number who were ill and made them well
Mak  And king Herod had news of him because his name was on the lips of all and he said John the Baptist has come back from the dead and for this reason these powers are working in him
Mak  But others said It is Elijah And others said It is a prophet even like one of the prophets
Mak  But Herod when he had news of it said John whom I put to death has come back from the dead
Mak  For Herod himself had sent men out to take John and put him in prison because of Herodias his brother Philips wife whom he had taken for himself
Mak  For John said to Herod It is wrong for you to have your brothers wife
Mak  And Herodias was bitter against him desiring to put him to death but she was not able
Mak  For Herod was in fear of John being conscious that he was an upright and holy man and kept him safe And hearing him he was much troubled and he gave ear to him gladly
Mak  And the chance came when Herod on his birthday gave a feast to his lords and the high captains and the chief men of Galilee
Mak  And when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and did a dance Herod and those who were at table with him were pleased with her and the king said to the girl Make a request for anything and I will give it you
Mak  And he took an oath saying to her Whatever is your desire I will give it to you even half of my kingdom
Mak  And she went out and said to her mother What is my request to be And she said The head of John the Baptist
Mak  And she came in quickly to the king and said My desire is that you give me straight away on a plate the head of John the Baptist
Mak  And the king was very sad but because of his oaths and those who were with him at table he would not say No to her
Mak  And straight away the king sent out one of his armed men and gave him an order to come back with the head and he went and took off Johns head in prison
Mak  And came back with the head on a plate and gave it to the girl and the girl gave it to her mother
Mak  And when his disciples had news of it they came and took up his body and put it in its last restingplace
Mak  And the twelve came together to Jesus and they gave him an account of all the things they had done and all they had been teaching
Mak  And he said to them Come away by yourselves to a quiet place and take a rest for a time Because there were a great number coming and going and they had no time even for food
Mak  And they went away in the boat to a waste place by themselves
Mak  And the people saw them going and a number of them having knowledge who they were went running there together on foot from all the towns and got there before them
Mak  And he got out and saw a great mass of people and he had pity on them because they were like sheep without a keeper and he gave them teaching about a number of things
Mak  And at the end of the day his disciples came to him and said This place is waste land and it is late
Mak  Send them away so that they may go into the country and small towns round about and get some food for themselves
Mak  But he said to them in answer Give them food yourselves And they said to him Are we to go and get bread for two hundred pence and give it to them
Mak  And he said to them How much bread have you go and see And when they had seen they said Five cakes of bread and two fishes
Mak  And he made them all be seated in groups on the green grass
Mak  And they were placed in groups by hundreds and by fifties
Mak  And he took the five cakes of bread and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he said words of blessing over them and when the cakes were broken he gave them to the disciples to put before the people and he made division of the two fishes among them all
Mak  And they all took of the food and had enough
Mak  And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken bits and of the fishes
Mak  And those who took of the bread were five thousand men
Mak  And straight away he made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side to Bethsaida while he himself sent the people away
Mak  And after he had sent them away he went up into a mountain for prayer
Mak  And by evening the boat was in the middle of the sea and he by himself on the land
Mak  And seeing that they had trouble in getting their boat through the water because the wind was against them about the fourth watch of the night he came to them walking on the sea and he would have gone past them
Mak  But they when they saw him walking on the sea took him for a spirit and gave a loud cry
Mak  For they all saw him and were troubled But straight away he said to them Take heart it is I have no fear
Mak  And he went to them into the boat and the wind went down and they were full of wonder in themselves
Mak  For it was not clear to them about the bread but their hearts were hard
Mak  And when they had gone across they came to Gennesaret and got their boat to land
Mak  And when they had got out of the boat the people quickly had news of him
Mak  And went running through all the country round about and took on their beds those who were ill to where it was said that he was
Mak  And wherever he went into small towns or great towns or into the country they took those who were ill into the marketplaces requesting him that they might put their hands even on the edge of his robe and all those who did so were made well
Mak  And there came together to him the Pharisees and certain of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem
Mak  And had seen that some of his disciples took their bread with unclean that is unwashed hands
Mak  Now the Pharisees and all the Jews do not take food without washing their hands with care keeping the old rule which has been handed down to them
Mak  And when they come from the marketplace they take no food till their hands are washed and a number of other orders there are which have been handed down to them to keepwashings of cups and pots and brass vessels
Mak  And the Pharisees and the scribes put the question to him Why do your disciples not keep the rules of the fathers but take their bread with unwashed hands
Mak  And he said Well did Isaiah say of you you false ones These people give me honour with their lips but their heart is far from me
Mak  But their worship is to no purpose while they give as their teaching the rules of men
Mak  For turning away from the law of God you keep the rules of men
Mak  And he said to them Truly you put on one side the law of God so that you may keep the rules which have been handed down to you
Mak  For Moses said Give honour to your father and mother and He who says evil of father or mother let him have the punishment of death
Mak  But you say If a man says to his father or his mother That by which you might have had profit from me is Corban that is to say Given to God
Mak  You no longer let him do anything for his father or his mother
Mak  Making the word of God of no effect by your rule which you have given and a number of other such things you do
Mak  And turning to the people again he said to them Give ear to me all of you and let my words be clear to you
Mak  There is nothing outside the man which going into him is able to make him unclean but the things which come out of the man are those which make the man unclean
Mak  
Mak  And when he had gone into the house away from all the people his disciples put questions to him about the saying
Mak  And he said to them Have even you so little wisdom Do you not see that whatever goes into a man from outside is not able to make him unclean
Mak  Because it goes not into the heart but into the stomach and goes out with the waste He said this making all food clean
Mak  And he said That which comes out of the man that makes the man unclean
Mak  Because from inside from the heart of men come evil thoughts and unclean pleasures
Mak  The taking of goods and of life broken faith between husband and wife the desire of wealth wrongdoing deceit sins of the flesh an evil eye angry words pride foolish acts
Mak  All these evil things come from inside and make the man unclean
Mak  And he went away from there to the country of Tyre and Sidon And he went into a house desiring that no man might have knowledge of it and he was not able to keep it secret
Mak  But a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit having had news of him came straight away and went down at his feet
Mak  Now the woman was a Greek a Syrophoenician by birth and she made a request to him that he would send the evil spirit out of her daughter
Mak  And he said to her Let the children first have their food for it is not right to take the childrens bread and give it to the dogs
Mak  But she said to him in answer Yes Lord even the dogs under the table take the bits dropped by the children
Mak  And he said to her For this saying go your way the evil spirit has gone out of your daughter
Mak  And she went away to her house and saw the child on the bed and the evil spirit gone out
Mak  And again he went out from Tyre and came through Sidon to the sea of Galilee through the country of Decapolis
Mak  And they came to him with one who had no power of hearing and had trouble in talking and they made a request to him to put his hands on him
Mak  And he took him on one side from the people privately and put his fingers into his ears and he put water from his mouth on the mans tongue with his finger
Mak  And looking up to heaven he took a deep breath and said to him Ephphatha that is Be open
Mak  And his ears became open and the band of his tongue was made loose and his words became clear
Mak  And he gave them orders not to give news of it to anyone but the more he made this request so much the more they made it public
Mak  And they were overcome with wonder saying He has done all things well he even gives back the power of hearing and the power of talking to those who have been without them
Mak  In those days again when there was a great mass of people and they had no food he made his disciples come to him and said to them
Mak  I have pity for these people because they have been with me now three days and have no food
Mak  If I send them away to their houses with no food they will be overcome by weariness on the way and some of them have come from far
Mak  And his disciples said in answer How will it be possible to get enough bread for these men here in a waste place
Mak  And he put the question How much bread have you And they said Seven cakes
Mak  And he made the people be seated on the earth and he took the seven cakes and having given praise he gave the broken bread to his disciples to put before them and they put it before the people
Mak  And they had some small fishes and blessing them he had them put before the people in the same way
Mak  And they took the food and had enough and they took up seven baskets full of the broken bits
Mak  And there were about four thousand people and he sent them away
Mak  And he got into the boat with his disciples straight away and came into the country of Dalmanutha
Mak  And the Pharisees came out and put questions to him requesting from him a sign from heaven testing him
Mak  And he was very sad in spirit and said Why is this generation looking for a sign truly I say to you No sign will be given to this generation
Mak  And he went away from them and again got into the boat and went across to the other side
Mak  And they had taken no thought to get bread and they had only one cake of bread with them in the boat
Mak  And he said to them Take care to be on the watch against the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod
Mak  And they said to one another We have no bread
Mak  And Jesus hearing it said to them Why are you reasoning among yourselves because you have no bread do you still not see and is it still not clear to you are your hearts so hard
Mak  Having eyes do you not see and having ears have you no hearing and have you no memory
Mak  When I made a division of the five cakes of bread among the five thousand what number of baskets full of broken bits did you take up They said to him Twelve
Mak  And when the seven among the four thousand what number of baskets full of broken bits did you take up And they said to him Seven
Mak  And he said to them Is it still not clear to you
Mak  And they came to Bethsaida And they took a blind man to him requesting him to put his hands on him
Mak  And he took the blind man by the hand and went with him out of the town and when he had put water from his mouth on his eyes and put his hands on him he said Do you see anything
Mak  And looking up he said I see men I see them like trees walking
Mak  Then again he put his hands on his eyes and looking hard he was able to see and saw all things clearly
Mak  And he sent him away to his house saying Do not even go into the town
Mak  And Jesus went out with his disciples into the little towns round Caesarea Philippi and on the way he put a question to his disciples saying Who do men say that I am
Mak  And they made answer John the Baptist and others Elijah but others One of the prophets
Mak  And he said to them But who do you say I am Peter said in answer You are the Christ
Mak  And he put them under orders not to say this of him to anyone
Mak  And teaching them he said that the Son of man would have to undergo much and be hated by those in authority and the chief priests and the scribes and be put to death and after three days come back from the dead
Mak  And he said this openly And Peter took him and was protesting
Mak  But he turning about and seeing his disciples said sharply to Peter Get out of my way Satan for your mind is not on the things of God but on the things of men
Mak  And turning to the mass of people with his disciples he said to them If any man has the desire to come after me let him give up all other desires and take up his cross and come after me
Mak  Whoever has a desire to keep his life will have it taken from him and whoever gives up his life because of me and the good news will keep it
Mak  What profit has a man if he gets all the world with the loss of his life
Mak  And what would a man give in exchange for his life
Mak  Whoever has a feeling of shame because of me and my words in this false and evil generation the Son of man will have a feeling of shame because of him when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels
Mak  And he said to them Truly I say to you There are some here who will have no taste of death till they see the kingdom of God come with power
Mak  And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John and made them go up with him into a high mountain by themselves and he was changed in form before them
Mak  And his clothing became shining very white as no cleaner on earth would make it
Mak  And there came before them Elijah with Moses and they were talking with Jesus
Mak  And Peter said to Jesus Master it is good for us to be here and let us make three tents one for you one for Moses and one for Elijah
Mak  Because he was not certain what to say for they were in great fear
Mak  And a cloud came over them and a voice came out of the cloud saying This is my dearly loved Son give ear to him
Mak  And suddenly looking round about they saw no one any longer but Jesus only with themselves
Mak  And while they were coming down from the mountain he gave them orders not to give word to any man of the things they had seen till the Son of man had come back from the dead
Mak  And they kept the saying questioning among themselves what the coming back from the dead might be
Mak  And they put a question to him saying Why do the scribes say that Elijah has to come first
Mak  And he said to them Truly Elijah does come first and puts all things in order and how is it said in the Writings that the Son of man will go through much sorrow and be made as nothing
Mak  But I say to you that Elijah has come and they have done to him whatever they were pleased to do even as the Writings say about him
Mak  And when they came to the disciples they saw a great mass of people about them and scribes questioning them
Mak  And straight away all the people when they saw him were full of wonder and running to him gave him worship
Mak  And he said What are you questioning them about
Mak  And one of the number said to him in answer Master I came to you with my son who has in him a spirit which takes away his power of talking
Mak  And wherever it takes him it puts him down violently streaming at the lips and twisted with pain and his strength goes from him and I made a request to your disciples to send it out and they were not able
Mak  And he said to them in answer O generation without faith how long will I have to be with you how long will I put up with you let him come to me
Mak  And they took him to him and when he saw him the spirit in him straight away became violent and he went down on the earth rolling about and streaming at the lips
Mak  And Jesus questioning the father said How long has he been like this And he said From a child
Mak  And frequently it has sent him into the fire and into the water for his destruction but if you are able to do anything have pity on us and give us help
Mak  And Jesus said to him If you are able All things are possible to him who has faith
Mak  Straight away the father of the child gave a cry saying I have faith make my feeble faith stronger
Mak  And when Jesus saw that the people came running together he gave orders to the unclean spirit saying to him You spirit who are the cause of his loss of voice and hearing I say to you come out of him and never again go into him
Mak  And after crying out and shaking him violently it came out and the child became like one dead so that most of them said He is dead
Mak  But Jesus took him by the hand lifting him up and he got up
Mak  And when he had gone into the house his disciples said to him privately Why were we unable to send it out
Mak  And he said to them Nothing will make this sort come out but prayer
Mak  And they went out from there through Galilee and it was his desire that no man might have knowledge of it
Mak  For he was giving his disciples teaching and saying to them The Son of man is given up into the hands of men and they will put him to death and when he is dead after three days he will come back from the dead
Mak  But the saying was not clear to them and they were in fear of questioning him about it
Mak  And they came to Capernaum and when he was in the house he put the question to them What were you talking about on the way
Mak  But they said nothing because they had had an argument between themselves on the way about who was the greatest
Mak  And seating himself he made the twelve come to him and he said to them If any man has the desire to be first he will be last of all and servant of all
Mak  And he took a little child and put him in the middle of them and taking him in his arms he said to them
Mak  Whoever will give honour to one such little child in my name gives honour to me and whoever gives honour to me gives honour not to me but to him who sent me
Mak  John said to him Master we saw one driving out evil spirits in your name and we said that he might not because he is not one of us
Mak  But Jesus said Say not so for there is no man who will do a great work in my name and be able at the same time to say evil of me
Mak  He who is not against us is for us
Mak  Whoever gives you a cup of water because you are Christs truly I say to you he will in no way be without his reward
Mak  And whoever is a cause of trouble to one of these little ones who have faith in me it would be better for him if a great stone was put round his neck and he was dropped into the sea
Mak  And if your hand is a cause of trouble to you let it be cut off it is better for you to go into life with one hand than to have two hands and go into hell into the eternal fire
Mak  
Mak  And if your foot is a cause of trouble to you let it be cut off it is better for you to go into life with one foot than to have two feet and go into hell
Mak  
Mak  And if your eye is a cause of trouble to you take it out it is better for you to go into the kingdom of God with one eye than having two eyes to go into hell
Mak  Where their worm is ever living and the fire is not put out
Mak  Everyone will be salted with fire
Mak  Salt is good but if the taste goes from it how will you make it salt again Have salt in yourselves and be at peace one with another
Mak  And he got up and went into the country of Judaea on the other side of Jordan and great numbers of people came together to him again and as was his way he gave them teaching
Mak  And Pharisees came to him testing him with the question Is it right for a man to put away his wife
Mak  And he said to them in answer What did Moses say you were to do
Mak  And they said to him Moses let us give her a statement in writing and be free from her
Mak  But Jesus said to them Because of your hard hearts he gave you this law
Mak  But from the first male and female made he them
Mak  For this cause will a man go away from his father and mother and be joined to his wife
Mak  And the two will become one flesh so that they are no longer two but one flesh
Mak  Let not that which has been joined together by God be parted by man
Mak  And in the house the disciples put questions to him again about this thing
Mak  And he said to them Whoever puts away his wife and takes another is false to his wife
Mak  And if she herself puts away her husband and takes another she is false to her husband
Mak  And they took to him little children so that he might put his hands on them and the disciples said sharp words to them
Mak  And when Jesus saw it he was angry and said to them Let the little children come to me and do not keep them away for of such is the kingdom of God
Mak  Truly I say to you Whoever does not put himself under the kingdom of God like a little child will not come into it at all
Mak  And he took them in his arms and gave them a blessing putting his hands on them
Mak  And while he was going out into the way a man came running to him and went down on his knees saying Good Master what have I to do so that I may have eternal life
Mak  And Jesus said to him Why do you say I am good no one is good but one and that is God
Mak  You have knowledge of what is said in the law Do not put any one to death Do not be untrue in married life Do not take what is not yours Do not give false witness Do not get money by deceit Give honour to your father and mother
Mak  And he said to him Master all these laws I have kept from the time when I was young
Mak  And Jesus looking on him and loving him said There is one thing needed go get money for your goods and give it to the poor and you will have wealth in heaven and come with me
Mak  But his face became sad at the saying and he went away sorrowing for he was one who had much property
Mak  And Jesus looking round about said to his disciples How hard it is for those who have wealth to come into the kingdom of God
Mak  And the disciples were full of wonder at his words But Jesus said to them again Children how hard it is for those who put faith in wealth to come into the kingdom of God
Mak  It is simpler for a camel to go through a needles eye than for a man of wealth to come into the kingdom of God
Mak  And they were greatly surprised saying to him Who then may have salvation
Mak  Jesus looking on them said With men it is impossible but not with God for all things are possible with God
Mak  Peter said to him See we have given up everything and come after you
Mak  Jesus said Truly I say to you There is no man who has given up house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or land because of me and the good news
Mak  Who will not get a hundred times as much now in this time houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and landthough with great troubles and in the world to come eternal life
Mak  But a great number who are first will be last and those who are last will be first
Mak  And they were on the way going up to Jerusalem and Jesus was going before them and they were full of wonder but those who came after him were in fear And again he took the twelve and gave them word of the things which were to come on him
Mak  Saying See we go up to Jerusalem and the Son of man will be given up to the chief priests and the scribes and they will give an order for his death and will give him up to the Gentiles
Mak  And they will make sport of him and put shame on him and give him cruel blows and will put him to death and after three days he will come back from the dead
Mak  And there came to him James and John the sons of Zebedee saying to him Master will you give us whatever may be our request
Mak  And he said to them What would you have me do for you
Mak  And they said to him Let us be seated one at your right hand and one at your left in your glory
Mak  But Jesus said to them You have no knowledge of what you are saying Are you able to take of my cup or to undergo the baptism which I am to undergo
Mak  And they said to him We are able And Jesus said to them You will take of the cup from which I take and the baptism which I am about to undergo you will undergo
Mak  But to be seated at my right hand or at my left is not for me to give but it is for those for whom it has been made ready
Mak  And hearing this the ten became very angry with James and John
Mak  And Jesus made them come to him and said to them You see that those who are made rulers over the Gentiles are lords over them and their great ones have authority over them
Mak  But it is not so among you but whoever has a desire to become great among you let him be your servant
Mak  And whoever has a desire to be first among you let him be servant of all
Mak  For truly the Son of man did not come to have servants but to be a servant and to give his life for the salvation of men
Mak  And they came to Jericho and when he was going out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people the son of Timaeus Bartimaeus a blind man was seated by the wayside with his hand out for money
Mak  And when it came to his ears that it was Jesus of Nazareth he gave a cry and said Jesus Son of David have mercy on me
Mak  And some of them turning in protest gave him an order to be quiet but he went on crying out all the more Son of David have mercy on me
Mak  And Jesus came to a stop and said Let him come And crying out to the blind man they said to him Be comforted come he has sent for you
Mak  And he putting off his coat got up quickly and came to Jesus
Mak  And Jesus said to him What would you have me do to you And the blind man said Master make me able to see
Mak  And Jesus said to him Go on your way your faith has made you well And straight away he was able to see and went after him in the way
Mak  And when they came near to Jerusalem to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mountain of Olives he sent two of his disciples
Mak  And said to them Go into the little town opposite and when you come to it you will see a young ass with a cord round his neck on which no man has ever been seated let him loose and come back with him
Mak  And if anyone says to you Why are you doing this say The Lord has need of him and will send him back straight away
Mak  And they went away and saw a young ass by the door outside in the open street and they were getting him loose
Mak  And some of those who were there said to them What are you doing taking the ass
Mak  And they said to them the words which Jesus had said and they let them go
Mak  And they took the young ass to Jesus and put their clothing on him and he got on his back
Mak  And a great number put down their clothing in the way and others put down branches which they had taken from the fields
Mak  And those who went in front and those who came after were crying Glory A blessing on him who comes in the name of the Lord
Mak  A blessing on the coming kingdom of our father David Glory in the highest
Mak  And he went into Jerusalem into the Temple and after looking round about on all things it being now evening he went out to Bethany with the twelve
Mak  And on the day after when they had come out from Bethany he was in need of food
Mak  And seeing a figtree in the distance with leaves he went to see if by chance it had anything on it and when he came to it he saw nothing but leaves for it was not the time for the fruit
Mak  And he said to it Let no man take fruit from you for ever And his disciples took note of his words
Mak  And they came to Jerusalem and he went into the Temple and sent out those who were trading there overturning the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of those who were offering doves for money
Mak  And he would not let any man take a vessel through the Temple
Mak  And he gave them teaching and said to them Is it not in the Writings My house is to be named a house of prayer for all the nations but you have made it a hole of thieves
Mak  And it came to the ears of the chief priests and scribes and they took thought how they might put him to death being in fear of him because all the people were full of wonder at his teaching
Mak  And every evening he went out of the town
Mak  And when they were going by in the morning they saw the figtree dead from the roots
Mak  And Peter having a memory of it said to him Master see the tree which was cursed by you is dead
Mak  And Jesus answering said to them Have Gods faith
Mak  Truly I say to you Whoever says to this mountain Be taken up and be put into the sea and has no doubt in his heart but has faith that what he says will come about he will have his desire
Mak  For this reason I say to you Whatever you make a request for in prayer have faith that it has been given to you and you will have it
Mak  And whenever you make a prayer let there be forgiveness in your hearts if you have anything against anyone so that you may have forgiveness for your sins from your Father who is in heaven
Mak  
Mak  And they came again to Jerusalem and while he was walking in the Temple there came to him the chief priests and the scribes and those in authority
Mak  And they said to him By what authority do you do these things or who gave you authority to do these things
Mak  And Jesus said to them I will put to you one question give me an answer and I will say by what authority I do these things
Mak  The baptism of John was it from heaven or from men give me an answer
Mak  And they gave thought to it among themselves saying If we say From heaven he will say Why then did you not have faith in him
Mak  But if we say From menthey were in fear of the people because all took John to be truly a prophet
Mak  And they said in answer to Jesus We have no idea And Jesus said to them And I will not say to you by what authority I do these things
Mak  And he gave them teaching in the form of stories A man had a vinegarden planted and put a wall about it and made a place for crushing out the wine and put up a tower and let it out to fieldworkers and went into another country
Mak  And when the time came he sent a servant to get from the workmen some of the fruit of the garden
Mak  And they took him and gave him blows and sent him away with nothing
Mak  And again he sent to them another servant and they gave him wounds on the head and were very cruel to him
Mak  And he sent another and they put him to death and a number of others whipping some and putting some to death
Mak  He still had one a dearly loved son he sent him last to them saying They will have respect for my son
Mak  But those workmen said among themselves This is he who will one day be the owner of the property come let us put him to death and the heritage will be ours
Mak  And they took him and put him to death pushing his body out of the garden
Mak  What then will the master of the garden do He will come and put the workmen to death and will give the garden into the hands of others
Mak  Have you not seen this which is in the Writings The stone which the builders put on one side the same was made the chief stone of the building
Mak  This was the Lords doing and it is a wonder in our eyes
Mak  And they made attempts to take him but they were in fear of the people because they saw that the story was against them and they went away from him
Mak  Then they sent to him certain of the Pharisees and the Herodians so that they might make use of his words to take him by a trick
Mak  And when they had come they said to him Master we are certain that you are true and have no fear of anyone you have no respect for a mans position but you are teaching the true way of God Is it right to give taxes to Caesar or not
Mak  Are we to give or not to give But he conscious of their false hearts said to them Why do you put me to the test give me a penny so that I may see it
Mak  And they gave him one And he said to them Whose is this image and name on it And they said to him Caesars
Mak  And Jesus said to them Give to Caesar the things which are Caesars and to God the things which are Gods And they were full of wonder at him
Mak  And there came to him Sadducees who say there is no coming back from the dead and they put a question to him saying
Mak  Master in the law Moses says If a mans brother comes to his end and has a wife still living and no child it is right for his brother to take his wife and get a family for his brother
Mak  There were seven brothers and the first took a wife and at his death there were no offspring
Mak  And the second took her and at his death there were no offspring and the third the same
Mak  And all the seven had no seed Last of all the woman herself came to her death
Mak  In the future life when they come back from the dead whose wife will she be for the seven had her for a wife
Mak  Jesus said to them Is not this the reason for your error that you have no knowledge of the holy Writings or of the power of God
Mak  When they come back from the dead they do not get married but are like the angels in heaven
Mak  But as to the dead coming back to life have you not seen in the book of Moses about the burning thorntree how God said to him I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob
Mak  He is not the God of the dead but of the living you are greatly in error
Mak  And one of the scribes came and hearing their argument together and seeing that he had given them a good answer put the question to him Which law is the first of all
Mak  Jesus said in answer The first is Give ear O Israel The Lord our God is one Lord
Mak  And you are to have love for the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength
Mak  The second is this Have love for your neighbour as for yourself There is no other law greater than these
Mak  And the scribe said to him Truly Master you have well said that he is one and there is no other but he
Mak  And to have love for him with all the heart and with all the mind and with all the strength and to have the same love for his neighbour as for himself is much more than all forms of offerings
Mak  And when Jesus saw that he gave a wise answer he said to him You are not far from the kingdom of God And every man after that was in fear of questioning him any more
Mak  And Jesus when he was teaching in the Temple said How do the scribes say that the Christ is the Son of David
Mak  David himself said in the Holy Spirit The Lord said to my Lord Be seated at my right hand till I put those who are against you under your feet
Mak  David himself gives him the name of Lord and how then is he his son And the common people gave ear to him gladly
Mak  And in his teaching he said Be on your watch against the scribes whose pleasure it is to go about in long robes and be respected in the marketplaces
Mak  And to have the chief seats in the Synagogues and the first places at feasts
Mak  Who take away the property of widows and before the eyes of men make long prayers these will be judged more hardly
Mak  And he took a seat by the place where the money was kept and saw how the people put money into the boxes and a number who had wealth put in much
Mak  And there came a poor widow and she put in two little bits of money which make a farthing
Mak  And he made his disciples come to him and said to them Truly I say to you This poor widow has put in more than all those who are putting money into the box
Mak  Because they all put in something out of what they had no need for but she out of her need put in all she had even all her living
Mak  And when he was going out of the Temple one of his disciples said to him Master see what stones and what buildings
Mak  And Jesus said to him Do you see these great buildings there is not one stone here resting on another which will not be overturned
Mak  And while he was seated on the Mountain of Olives opposite the Temple Peter and James and John and Andrew said to him privately
Mak  Say when these things will be and what will be the sign when these things are all about to be done
Mak  And Jesus said to them Take care that you are not tricked by anyone
Mak  People will come in my name saying I am he and a number will be turned from the true way
Mak  And when you have news of wars and talk of wars do not be troubled these things have to be but it is still not the end
Mak  Nation will go to war with nation and kingdom with kingdom there will be earthshocks in different places there will be times when there is no food these things are the first of the troubles
Mak  But take care for they will give you up to the Sanhedrins and in Synagogues you will be whipped and you will be taken before rulers and kings because of me for a sign to them
Mak  And the good news has first to be given to all the nations
Mak  And when you are taken and given up to be judged do not be troubled about what to say but whatever is given to you in that hour say because it is not you who say it but the Holy Spirit
Mak  And brother will give up brother to death and the father his child and children will go against their fathers and mothers and put them to death
Mak  And you will be hated by all men because of my name but he who goes through to the end will have salvation
Mak  But when you see the unclean thing which makes destruction in the place where it has no right to be let this be clear to the reader then let those who are in Judaea go quickly to the mountains
Mak  And let him who is on the housetop not go down or go in to take anything out of his house
Mak  And let not him who is in the field go back to take his coat
Mak  And it will be hard for women who are with child and for her who has a baby at the breast in those days
Mak  And say a prayer that it may not be in the winter
Mak  For in those days there will be sorrow such as there has not been from the time when God made the world till now and will not ever be again
Mak  And if the Lord had not made the time short no flesh would have been kept from destruction but because of the saints he has made the time short
Mak  And then if any man says to you See here is Christ or See there have no faith in it
Mak  Because there will be false Christs and false prophets and they will give signs and wonders in the hope of turning even the saints from the true way
Mak  But take care see I have made all things clear to you before the time
Mak  But in those days after that time of trouble the sun will be made dark and the moon will not give her light
Mak  And the stars will be falling from heaven and the powers which are in the heavens will be moved
Mak  And then they will see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory
Mak  And then he will send out the angels and will get together his saints from the four winds from the farthest part of the earth to the farthest part of heaven
Mak  Take an example from the figtree when its branches become soft and put out their leaves you see that the summer is near
Mak  Even so when you see these things taking place you may be certain that he is near even at the doors
Mak  Truly I say to you This generation will not come to an end till all these things are complete
Mak  Heaven and earth will come to an end but my words will not come to an end
Mak  But of that day or that hour no one has knowledge not even the angels in heaven or the Son but the Father
Mak  Take care keep watch with prayer for you are not certain when the time will be
Mak  It is as when a man who is in another country for a time having gone away from his house and given authority to his servants and to everyone his work gives the porter an order to keep watch
Mak  So you are to keep watch because you are not certain when the master of the house is coming in the evening or in the middle of the night or at the cocks cry or in the morning
Mak  For fear that coming suddenly he sees you sleeping
Mak  And what I say to you I say to all Keep watch
Mak  It was now two days before the feast of the Passover and the unleavened bread and the chief priests and the scribes made designs how they might take him by deceit and put him to death
Mak  But they said Not while the feast is going on for fear there may be trouble among the people
Mak  And while he was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper seated at table there came a woman with a bottle of perfumed oil of great price and when the bottle was broken she put the perfume on his head
Mak  But some of them were angry among themselves saying For what purpose has this oil been wasted
Mak  We might have got more than three hundred pence for it and given the money to the poor And they said things against her among themselves
Mak  But Jesus said Let her be why are you troubling her she has done a kind act to me
Mak  The poor you have ever with you and whenever you have the desire you may do them good but me you have not for ever
Mak  She has done what she was able she has put oil on my body to make it ready for its last restingplace
Mak  And truly I say to you Wherever the good news goes out through all the earth what this woman has done will be talked of in memory of her
Mak  And Judas Iscariot who was one of the twelve went away to the chief priests so that he might give him up to them
Mak  And hearing what he said they were glad and gave him their word to make him a payment of money And he took thought how he might best give him up to them
Mak  And on the first day of unleavened bread when the Passover lamb is put to death his disciples said to him Where are we to go and make ready for you to take the Passover meal
Mak  And he sent two of his disciples and said to them Go into the town and there will come to you a man with a vessel of water go after him
Mak  And wherever he goes in say to the owner of the house The Master says Where is my guestroom where I may take the Passover with my disciples
Mak  And he will take you up himself to a great room with a table and seats there make ready for us
Mak  And the disciples went out and came into the town and saw that it was as he had said and they made ready the Passover
Mak  And when it was evening he came with the twelve
Mak  And while they were seated taking food Jesus said Truly I say to you One of you will be false to me one who is taking food with me
Mak  They were sad and said to him one by one Is it I
Mak  And he said to them It is one of the twelve one who is putting his bread with me into the same plate
Mak  The Son of man goes even as the Writings say of him but cursed is that man through whom the Son of man is given up It would have been well for that man if he had never been given birth
Mak  And while they were taking food he took bread and after blessing it he gave the broken bread to them and said Take it this is my body
Mak  And he took a cup and when he had given praise he gave it to them and they all had a drink from it
Mak  And he said to them This is my blood of the testament which is given for men
Mak  Truly I say to you I will take no more of the fruit of the vine till the day when I take it new in the kingdom of God
Mak  And after a song of praise to God they went out to the Mountain of Olives
Mak  And Jesus said to them You will all be turned away from me for it is in the Writings I will put the keeper of the sheep to death and the sheep will be put to flight
Mak  But after I have come back from the dead I will go before you into Galilee
Mak  But Peter said to him Though the others may be turned away from you I will not
Mak  And Jesus said to him Truly I say to you that you today even this night before the cocks second cry will say three times that you have no knowledge of me
Mak  But he said with passion If I have to be put to death with you I will not be false to you And they all said the same
Mak  And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane and he said to his disciples Be seated here while I say a prayer
Mak  And he took with him Peter and James and John and grief and great trouble came on him
Mak  And he said to them My soul is very sad even to death be here a little time and keep watch
Mak  And he went forward a little and falling down on the earth made request that if possible the hour might go from him
Mak  And he said Abba Father all things are possible to you take away this cup from me but even so let not my pleasure but yours be done
Mak  And he came and saw them sleeping and said to Peter Simon are you sleeping were you not able to keep watch one hour
Mak  Keep watch with prayer so that you may not be put to the test the spirit truly is ready but the flesh is feeble
Mak  And again he went away and said a prayer using the same words
Mak  And again he came and saw them sleeping because their eyes were very tired and they had nothing to say in answer
Mak  And he came the third time and said to them Go on sleeping now and take your rest it is enough the hour has come see the Son of man is given up into the hands of evil men
Mak  Get up let us be going see he who gives me up is near
Mak  And straight away while he was still talking Judas one of the twelve came and with him a great band with swords and sticks from the chief priests and the scribes and those in authority
Mak  Now he who had been false to him had given them a sign saying The one to whom I give a kiss that is he take him and get him away safely
Mak  And when he had come he went straight to him and said Master and gave him a kiss
Mak  And they put their hands on him and took him
Mak  But a certain one of those who were near took out his sword and gave the servant of the high priest a blow cutting off his ear
Mak  And Jesus said to them Have you come out as against a thief with swords and sticks to take me
Mak  I was with you every day in the Temple teaching and you did not take me but this is done so that the Writings may come true
Mak  And they all went away from him in fear
Mak  And a certain young man went after him with only a linen cloth about his body and they put their hands on him
Mak  But he got away unclothed without the linen cloth
Mak  And they took Jesus away to the high priest and there came together with him all the chief priests and those in authority and the scribes
Mak  And Peter had come after him at a distance even into the house of the high priest and he was seated with the captains warming himself in the light of the fire
Mak  Now the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin were looking for witness against Jesus so that they might put him to death and they were unable to get any
Mak  For a number gave false witness against him and their witness was not in agreement
Mak  Then some got up and gave false witness against him saying
Mak  He said in our hearing I will put an end to this Temple which is made with hands and in three days I will make another without hands
Mak  And even so their witness was not in agreement
Mak  And the high priest got up in the middle of them and said to Jesus Do you say nothing in answer what is it which these say against you
Mak  But he kept quiet and said nothing Again the high priest questioning him said Are you the Christ the son of the Holy One
Mak  And Jesus said I am and you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of power and coming with the clouds of heaven
Mak  And the high priest violently parting his robes said What more need have we of witnesses
Mak  His words against God have come to your ears what is your opinion And they all said it was right for him to be put to death
Mak  And some put shame on him and covering his face gave him blows and said to him Now say what is to come and the captains took him and gave him blows with their hands
Mak  And while Peter was down in the open square of the building one of the servantgirls of the high priest came
Mak  And seeing Peter warming himself by the fire she gave him a look and said You were with this Nazarene even Jesus
Mak  But he said I have no knowledge of him or of what you are saying and he went out into the doorway and there came the cry of a cock
Mak  And the girl saw him and said again to those who were near This is one of them
Mak  But again he said it was not so And after a little time again those who were near said to Peter Truly you are one of them for you are a Galilaean
Mak  But with curses and oaths he said I have no knowledge of the man about whom you are talking
Mak  And in the same minute the cock gave a second cry And it came to Peters mind how Jesus had said to him Before the cocks second cry you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me And at this thought he was overcome with weeping
Mak  And the first thing in the morning the chief priests with those in authority and the scribes and all the Sanhedrin had a meeting and put cords round Jesus and took him away and gave him up to Pilate
Mak  And Pilate put a question to him Are you the King of the Jews And he answering said to him You say so
Mak  And the chief priests said a number of things against him
Mak  And Pilate again put a question Do you say nothing in answer see how much evil they say you have done
Mak  But Jesus gave no more answers so that Pilate was full of wonder
Mak  Now at the feast every year he let one prisoner go free at their request
Mak  And there was one named Barabbas in prison with those who had gone against the government and in the fight had taken life
Mak  And the people went up requesting him to do as he had done for them in other years
Mak  And Pilate said in answer to them Is it your desire that I let the King of the Jews go free
Mak  For he saw that the chief priests had given him up through envy
Mak  But the people were moved by the chief priests to make him let Barabbas go free
Mak  And Pilate again said in answer to them What then am I to do to him to whom you give the name of the King of the Jews
Mak  And they said again loudly To the cross with him
Mak  And Pilate said to them Why what evil has he done But their cry was the louder To the cross
Mak  And Pilate desiring to do what was pleasing to the people let Barabbas go free and gave up Jesus when he had been whipped to be put to death on the cross
Mak  And the men of the army took him away into the square in front of the building which is the Praetorium and they got together all the band
Mak  And they put a purple robe on him and twisting a crown of thorns they put it on him
Mak  And as if honouring him they said Long life to the King of the Jews
Mak  And they gave him blows on the head with a stick and put shame on him and going down on their knees gave him worship
Mak  And when they had made sport of him they took the purple robe off him and put his clothing on him And they took him out to put him to death on the cross
Mak  And they made one Simon of Cyrene the father of Alexander and Rufus who was going by coming from the country go with them so that he might take his cross
Mak  And they took him to the place named Golgotha which is Dead Mans Head
Mak  And they gave him wine mixed with myrrh but he did not take it
Mak  And he was nailed to the cross and they made a division of his clothing among them putting to the decision of chance what everyone was to take
Mak  And it was the third hour when they put him on the cross
Mak  And the statement of his crime was put in writing on the cross THE KING OF THE JEWS
Mak  And they put two thieves on crosses with him one on his right side and one on his left
Mak  
Mak  And those who went by made sport of him shaking their heads and saying Ha you who give the Temple to destruction and put it up again in three days
Mak  Keep yourself from death and come down from the cross
Mak  In the same way the chief priests laughing at him among themselves with the scribes said A saviour of others he has no salvation for himself
Mak  Let the Christ the King of Israel come down now from the cross so that we may see and have belief And those who were put on crosses with him said evil things against him
Mak  And when the sixth hour had come it was dark over all the land till the ninth hour
Mak  And at the ninth hour Jesus said in a loud voice Eloi Eloi lama sabachthani which is My God my God why are you turned away from me
Mak  And some of those who were near hearing it said See he is crying to Elijah
Mak  And one of them went quickly and getting a sponge full of bitter wine put it on a rod and gave it to him for drink saying Let be let us see if Elijah will come to take him down
Mak  And Jesus gave a loud cry and gave up his spirit
Mak  And the curtain of the Temple was parted in two from end to end
Mak  And when the captain who was near saw how he gave up his spirit he said Truly this man was a son of God
Mak  And there were women watching from a distance among them were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses and Salome
Mak  Who went with him when he was in Galilee and took care of him and a number of other women who came up with him to Jerusalem
Mak  And when it was evening because it was the time of getting ready that is the day before the Sabbath
Mak  There came Joseph of Arimathaea a responsible man in high honour who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God and he went in to Pilate without fear and made a request for the body of Jesus
Mak  And Pilate was surprised that he was dead and sending for the captain he put a question to see if he had been dead for long
Mak  And when he had news of it from the captain he let Joseph have the body
Mak  And he got a linen cloth and taking him down put the linen cloth round him and put him in a place for the dead which had been cut out of a rock and a stone was rolled against the door
Mak  And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was put
Mak  And when the Sabbath was past Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Salome got spices so that they might come and put them on him
Mak  And very early after dawn on the first day of the week they came at the time of the coming up of the sun to the place where the body had been put
Mak  And they were saying among themselves Who will get the stone rolled away from the door for us
Mak  And looking up they saw that the stone was rolled back and it was of great size
Mak  And when they went in they saw a young man seated on the right side dressed in a white robe and they were full of wonder
Mak  And he said to them Do not be troubled you are looking for Jesus the Nazarene who has been put to death on the cross he has come back from the dead he is not here see the place where they put him
Mak  But go say to his disciples and to Peter He goes before you into Galilee there you will see him as he said to you
Mak  And they went out quickly from the place because fear and great wonder had come on them and they said nothing to anyone because they were full of fear that 
Mak  Now when he came back from the dead early on the first day of the week he went first to Mary Magdalene from whom he had sent out seven evil spirits
Mak  She went and gave news of it to those who had been with him while they were sorrowing and weeping
Mak  And they when it came to their ears that he was living and had been seen by her had no belief in it
Mak  And after these things he was seen in another form by two of them while they were walking on their way into the country
Mak  And they went away and gave news of it to the rest and they had no belief in what was said
Mak  And later he was seen by the eleven themselves while they were taking food and he said sharp words to them because they had no faith and their hearts were hard and because they had no belief in those who had seen him after he had come back from the dead
Mak  And he said to them Go into all the world and give the good news to everyone
Mak  He who has faith and is given baptism will get salvation but he who has not faith will be judged
Mak  And these signs will be with those who have faith in my name they will send out evil spirits and they will make use of new languages
Mak  They will take up snakes and if there is poison in their drink it will do them no evil they will put their hands on those who are ill and they will get well
Mak  So then the Lord Jesus after he had said these words to them was taken up into heaven and took his seat at the right hand of God
Mak  And they went out preaching everywhere the Lord working with them and giving witness to the word by the signs which came after So be it
Luk  As a number of attempts have been made to put together in order an account of those events which took place among us
Luk  As they were handed down to us by those who saw them from the first and were preachers of the word
Luk  It seemed good to me having made observation with great care of the direction of events in their order to put the facts in writing for you most noble Theophilus
Luk  So that you might have certain knowledge of those things about which you were given teaching
Luk  In the days of Herod king of Judaea there was a certain priest by name Zacharias of the order of Abijah and he had a wife of the family of Aaron and her name was Elisabeth
Luk  They were upright in the eyes of God keeping all the rules and orders of God and doing no wrong
Luk  And they were without children because Elisabeth had never given birth and they were at that time very old
Luk  Now it came about that in his turn he was acting as priest before God
Luk  And as was the way of the priests he had to go into the Temple to see to the burning of perfumes
Luk  And all the people were offering prayers outside at the time of the burning of perfumes
Luk  And he saw an angel of the Lord in his place on the right side of the altar
Luk  And Zacharias was troubled when he saw him and fear came on him
Luk  But the angel said Have no fear Zacharias for your prayer has come to the ears of God and your wife Elisabeth will have a son and his name will be John
Luk  And you will be glad and have great delight and numbers of people will have joy at his birth
Luk  For he will be great in the eyes of the Lord he will not take wine or strong drink and he will be full of the Spirit of God from his birth
Luk  And through him great numbers of the children of Israel will be turned to the Lord their God
Luk  And he will go before his face in the spirit and power of Elijah turning the hearts of fathers to their children and wrongdoers to the way of righteousness to make ready a people whose hearts have been turned to the Lord
Luk  And Zacharias said to the angel How may I be certain of this For I am an old man and my wife is far on in years
Luk  And the angel answering said I am Gabriel whose place is before God I have been sent to say these words to you and to give you this good news
Luk  Now see you will be without voice or language till the day when these things come about because you had not faith in my words which will have effect at the right time
Luk  And the people were waiting for Zacharias and were surprised because he was in the Temple for such a long time
Luk  And when he came out he was not able to say anything and they saw that he had seen a vision in the Temple and he was making signs to them without words
Luk  And when the days of his work in the Temple were ended he went back to his house
Luk  After that time Elisabeth being certain that she was to become a mother kept herself from mens eyes for five months saying
Luk  The Lord has done this to me for his eyes were on me to take away my shame in the eyes of men
Luk  Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town in Galilee named Nazareth
Luk  To a virgin who was to be married to a man named Joseph of the family of David and the name of the virgin was Mary
Luk  And the angel came in to her and said Peace be with you to whom special grace has been given the Lord is with you
Luk  But she was greatly troubled at his words and said to herself What may be the purpose of these words
Luk  And the angel said to her Have no fear Mary for you have Gods approval
Luk  And see you will give birth to a son and his name will be Jesus
Luk  He will be great and will be named the Son of the Most High and the Lord God will give him the kingdom of David his father
Luk  He will have rule over the house of Jacob for ever and of his kingdom there will be no end
Luk  And Mary said to the angel How may this be because I have had no knowledge of a man
Luk  And the angel in answer said to her The Holy Spirit will come on you and the power of the Most High will come to rest on you and so that which will come to birth will be named holy Son of God
Luk  Even now Elisabeth who is of your family is to be a mother though she is old and this is the sixth month with her who was without children
Luk  For there is nothing which God is not able to do
Luk  And Mary said I am the servant of the Lord may it be to me as you say And the angel went away
Luk  Then Mary got up and went quickly into the high lands to a town of Judah
Luk  And went into the house of Zacharias and took Elisabeth in her arms
Luk  And when the voice of Mary came to the ears of Elisabeth the baby made a sudden move inside her then Elisabeth was full of the Holy Spirit
Luk  And she said with a loud voice May blessing be on you among women and a blessing on the child of your body
Luk  How is it that the mother of my Lord comes to me
Luk  For truly when the sound of your voice came to my ears the baby in my body made a sudden move for joy
Luk  Happy will she be who had faith that the things which the Lord has said to her will be done
Luk  And Mary said My soul gives glory to God
Luk  My spirit is glad in God my Saviour
Luk  For he has had pity on his servant though she is poor and lowly placed and from this hour will all generations give witness to the blessing which has come to me
Luk  For he who is strong has done great things for me and holy is his name
Luk  His mercy is for all generations in whom is the fear of him
Luk  With his arm he has done acts of power he has put to flight those who have pride in their hearts
Luk  He has put down kings from their seats lifting up on high the men of low degree
Luk  Those who had no food he made full of good things the men of wealth he sent away with nothing in their hands
Luk  His help he has given to Israel his servant so that he might keep in mind his mercy to Abraham and his seed for ever
Luk  As he gave his word to our fathers
Luk  And Mary was with her for about three months and then went back to her house
Luk  Now it was time for Elisabeth to give birth and she had a son
Luk  And it came to the ears of her neighbours and relations that the Lord had been very good to her and they took part in her joy
Luk  And on the eighth day they came to see to the circumcision of the child and they would have given him the name of Zacharias his fathers name
Luk  But his mother made answer and said No his name is John
Luk  And they said Not one of your relations has that name
Luk  And they made signs to his father to say what name was to be given to him
Luk  And he sent for writing materials and put down His name is John and they were all surprised
Luk  And straight away his mouth was open and his tongue was free and he gave praise to God
Luk  And fear came on all those who were living round about them and there was much talk about all these things in all the hillcountry of Judaea
Luk  And all who had word of them kept them in their minds and said What will this child be For the hand of the Lord was with him
Luk  And his father Zacharias was full of the Holy Spirit and with the voice of a prophet said these words
Luk  Praise be to the Lord the God of Israel for he has come to his people and made them free
Luk  Lifting up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David
Luk  As he said by the mouth of his holy prophets from the earliest times
Luk  Salvation from those who are against us and from the hands of those who have hate for us
Luk  To do acts of mercy to our fathers and to keep in mind his holy word
Luk  The oath which he made to Abraham our father
Luk  That we being made free from the fear of those who are against us might give him worship
Luk  In righteousness and holy living before him all our days
Luk  And you child will be named the prophet of the Most High you will go before the face of the Lord to make ready his ways
Luk  To give knowledge of salvation to his people through the forgiveness of sins
Luk  Because of the loving mercies of our God by which the dawn from heaven has come to us
Luk  To give light to those in dark places and in the shade of death so that our feet may be guided into the way of peace
Luk  And the child became tall and strong in spirit and he was living in the waste land till the day when he came before the eyes of Israel
Luk  Now it came about in those days that an order went out from Caesar Augustus that there was to be a numbering of all the world
Luk  This was the first numbering which was made when Quirinius was ruler of Syria
Luk  And all men went to be numbered everyone to his town
Luk  And Joseph went up from Galilee out of the town of Nazareth into Judaea to Bethlehem the town of David because he was of the house and family of David
Luk  To be put on the list with Mary his future wife who was about to become a mother
Luk  And while they were there the time came for her to give birth
Luk  And she had her first son and folding him in linen she put him to rest in the place where the cattle had their food because there was no room for them in the house
Luk  And in the same country there were keepers of sheep in the fields watching over their flock by night
Luk  And an angel of the Lord came to them and the glory of the Lord was shining round about them and fear came on them
Luk  And the angel said Have no fear for truly I give you good news of great joy which will be for all the people
Luk  For on this day in the town of David a Saviour has come to birth who is Christ the Lord
Luk  And this is the sign to you you will see a young child folded in linen in the place where the cattle have their food
Luk  And suddenly there was with the angel a great band of spirits from heaven giving praise to God and saying
Luk  Glory to God in the highest and on the earth peace among men with whom he is well pleased
Luk  And when the angels had gone away from them into heaven the keepers of the sheep said to one another Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing which has come about which the Lord has made clear to us
Luk  And they came quickly and saw Mary and Joseph and the child in the place where the cattle had their food
Luk  And when they saw it they gave them an account of the things which had been said to them about the child
Luk  And all those to whose ears it came were full of wonder at the things said by the keepers of the sheep
Luk  But Mary kept all these words in her heart and gave much thought to them
Luk  Then the keepers of the sheep went back giving glory and praise to God for all the things which had come to their ears and which they had seen as it had been said to them
Luk  And when after eight days the time came for his circumcision he was named Jesus the name which the angel had given to him before his birth
Luk  And when the necessary days for making them clean by the law of Moses had come to an end they took him to Jerusalem to give him to the Lord
Luk  As it says in the law of the Lord Every mothers first male child is to be holy to the Lord
Luk  And to make an offering as it is ordered in the law of the Lord of two doves or other young birds
Luk  And there was then in Jerusalem a man whose name was Simeon and he was an upright man fearing God and waiting for the comfort of Israel and the Holy Spirit was on him
Luk  And he had knowledge through the Holy Spirit that he would not see death till he had seen the Lords Christ
Luk  And full of the Spirit he came into the Temple and when the father and mother came in with the child Jesus to do with him what was ordered by the law
Luk  Then he took him in his arms and gave praise to God and said
Luk  Now you are letting your servant go in peace O Lord as you have said
Luk  For my eyes have seen your salvation
Luk  Which you have made ready before the face of all nations
Luk  A light of revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of your people Israel
Luk  And his father and mother were full of wonder at the things which were said about him
Luk  And Simeon gave them his blessing and said to Mary his mother See this child will be the cause of the downfall and the lifting up of great numbers of people in Israel and he will be a sign against which hard words will be said
Luk  And a sword will go through your heart so that the secret thoughts of men may come to light
Luk  And there was one Anna a woman prophet the daughter of Phanuel of the family of Asher she was very old and after seven years of married life
Luk  She had been a widow for eightyfour years she was in the Temple at all times worshipping with prayers and going without food night and day
Luk  And coming up at that time she gave praise to God talking of him to all those who were waiting for the freeing of Jerusalem
Luk  And when they had done all the things which were ordered by the law of the Lord they went back to Galilee to Nazareth the town where they were living
Luk  And the child became tall and strong and full of wisdom and the grace of God was on him
Luk  And every year his father and mother went to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover
Luk  And when he was twelve years old they went up as their way was to the feast
Luk  And when the days of the feast came to an end and they were going back the boy Jesus was still in Jerusalem but they had no knowledge of it
Luk  And in the belief that he was with some of their number they went a days journey and after looking for him among their relations and friends
Luk  And seeing that he was not there they went back to Jerusalem to make search for him
Luk  And after three days they came across him in the Temple seated among the wise men giving ear to their words and putting questions to them
Luk  And all to whose ears it came were full of wonder at his knowledge and the answers which he gave
Luk  And when they saw him they were surprised and his mother said to him Son why have you done this to us see your father and I have been looking for you with sorrow
Luk  And he said to them Why were you looking for me was it not clear to you that my right place was in my Fathers house
Luk  And his words seemed strange to them
Luk  And he went down with them and came to Nazareth and did as he was ordered and his mother kept all these words in her heart
Luk  And Jesus was increasing in wisdom and in years and in grace before God and men
Luk  Now in the fifteenth year of the rule of Tiberius Caesar Pontius Pilate being ruler of Judaea and Herod being king of Galilee his brother Philip king of the country of Ituraea and Trachonitis and Lysanias king of Abilene
Luk  When Annas and Caiaphas were high priests the word of the Lord came to John the son of Zacharias in the waste land
Luk  And he came into all the country round about Jordan preaching baptism as a sign of forgiveness of sin for those whose hearts were changed
Luk  As it says in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet The voice of one crying in the waste land Make ready the way of the Lord make his roads straight
Luk  Every valley will be lifted up and all the mountains and hills made low and the twisted will be made straight and the rough ways smooth
Luk  And all flesh will see the salvation of God
Luk  So he said to the people who went out to him for baptism You offspring of snakes at whose word are you going in flight from the wrath to come
Luk  Make clear by your acts that your hearts have been changed and do not say to yourselves We have Abraham for our father for I say to you that God is able from these stones to make children of Abraham
Luk  And even now the axe is put to the root of the trees and every tree which does not have good fruit will be cut down and put into the fire
Luk  And the people put questions to him saying What have we to do
Luk  And he made answer and said to them He who has two coats let him give to him who has not even one and he who has food let him do the same
Luk  Then taxfarmers came to him for baptism and said to him Master what have we to do
Luk  And he said to them Do not make an attempt to get more money than the right amount
Luk  And men of the army put questions to him saying And what have we to do And he said to them Do no violent acts to any man and do not take anything without right and let your payment be enough for you
Luk  And while the people were waiting and all men were questioning in their hearts about John if he was the Christ or not
Luk  John made answer saying to them all Truly I give you baptism with water but one is coming who is greater than I whose shoes I am not good enough to undo he will give you baptism with the Holy Spirit and with fire
Luk  In whose hand is the instrument with which he will make clean his grain he will put the good grain in his store but the waste will be burned in the fire which will never be put out
Luk  And so comforting them with these and other words he gave the good news to the people
Luk  But Herod the king because John had made a protest on account of Herodias his brothers wife and other evil things which Herod had done
Luk  Did this most evil thing of all and had John shut up in prison
Luk  Now it came about that when all the people had been given baptism Jesus having had baptism with them was in prayer when the heaven being open
Luk  The Holy Spirit came down in the form of a dove and a voice came from heaven saying You are my dearly loved Son with whom I am well pleased
Luk  And Jesus at this time was about thirty years old being the son as it seemed of Joseph the son of Heli
Luk  The son of Matthat the son of Levi the son of Melchi the son of Jannai the son of Joseph
Luk  The son of Mattathias the son of Amos the son of Nahum the son of Esli the son of Naggai
Luk  The son of Maath the son of Mattathias the son of Semein the son of Josech the son of Joda
Luk  The son of Joanan the son of Rhesa the son of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel the son of Neri
Luk  The son of Melchi the son of Addi the son of Cosam the son of Elmadam the son of Er
Luk  The son of Jesus the son of Eliezer the son of Jorim the son of Matthat the son of Levi
Luk  The son of Symeon the son of Judas the son of Joseph the son of Jonam the son of Eliakim
Luk  The son of Melea the son of Menna the son of Mattatha the son of Nathan the son of David
Luk  The son of Jesse the son of Obed the son of Boaz the son of Salmon the son of Nahshon
Luk  The son of Amminadab the son of Arni the son of Hezron the son of Perez the son of Judah
Luk  The son of Jacob the son of Isaac the son of Abraham the son of Terah the son of Nahor
Luk  The son of Serug the son of Reu the son of Peleg the son of Eber the son of Shelah
Luk  The son of Cainan the son of Arphaxad the son of Shem the son of Noah the son of Lamech
Luk  The son of Methuselah the son of Enoch the son of Jared the son of Mahalaleel the son of Cainan
Luk  The son of Enos the son of Seth the son of Adam the son of God
Luk  And Jesus full of the Holy Spirit came back from the Jordan and was guided by the Spirit in the waste land
Luk  For forty days being tested by the Evil One And he had no food in those days and when they came to an end he was in need of food
Luk  And the Evil One said to him If you are the Son of God give orders to this stone to become bread
Luk  And Jesus made answer to him It has been said in the Writings Bread is not mans only need
Luk  And he took him up and let him see all the kingdoms of the earth in a minute of time
Luk  And the Evil One said I will give you authority over all these and the glory of them for it has been given to me and I give it to anyone at my pleasure
Luk  If then you will give worship to me it will all be yours
Luk  And Jesus in answer said to him It has been said in the Writings Give worship to the Lord your God and be his servant only
Luk  And he took him to Jerusalem and put him on the highest point of the Temple and said to him If you are the Son of God let yourself go down from here for it is said in the Writings
Luk  He will give his angels orders to take care of you
Luk  And In their hands they will keep you up so that your foot may not be crushed against a stone
Luk  And Jesus made answer and said to him It is said in the Writings You may not put the Lord your God to the test
Luk  And when all these tests were ended the Evil One went away from him for a time
Luk  And Jesus came back to Galilee in the power of the Spirit and the news of him went through all the country round about
Luk  And he was teaching in their Synagogues and all men gave him praise
Luk  And he came to Nazareth where he had been as a child and he went as his way was into the Synagogue on the Sabbath and got up to give a reading
Luk  And the book of the prophet Isaiah was given to him and opening the book he came on the place where it is said
Luk  The Spirit of the Lord is on me because I am marked out by him to give good news to the poor he has sent me to make well those who are brokenhearted to say that the prisoners will be let go and the blind will see and to make the wounded free from their chains
Luk  To give knowledge that the year of the Lords good pleasure is come
Luk  And shutting the book he gave it back to the servant and took his seat and the eyes of all in the Synagogue were fixed on him
Luk  Then he said to them Today this word has come true in your hearing
Luk  And they were all giving witness with wonder to the words of grace which came from his mouth and they said Is not this the son of Joseph
Luk  And he said to them Without doubt you will say to me Let the medical man make himself well the things which to our knowledge were done at Capernaum do them here in your country
Luk  And he said to them Truly I say to you No prophet is honoured in his country
Luk  Truly I say to you There were a number of widows in Israel in the days of Elijah when the heaven was shut up for three years and six months and there was no food in the land
Luk  But Elijah was not sent to one of them but only to Zarephath in the land of Sidon to a woman who was a widow
Luk  And there were a number of lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet and not one of them was made clean but only Naaman the Syrian
Luk  And all who were in the Synagogue were very angry when these things were said to them
Luk  And they got up and took him out of the town to the edge of the mountain on which their town was so that they might send him down to his death
Luk  But he came through them and went on his way
Luk  And he came down to Capernaum a town of Galilee and he was giving them teaching on the Sabbath
Luk  And they were surprised at his teaching for his word was with authority
Luk  And there was a man in the Synagogue who had an unclean spirit and he gave a loud cry and said
Luk  Let us be what have we to do with you Jesus of Nazareth have you come to put an end to us I have knowledge who you are the Holy One of God
Luk  And Jesus said to him Be quiet and come out of him And when the evil spirit had put him down on the earth in the middle of them he came out of him having done him no damage
Luk  And wonder came on them all and they said to one another What are these words for with authority and power he gives orders to the evil spirits and they come out
Luk  And there was much talk about him in all the places round about
Luk  And he got up and went out of the Synagogue and went into the house of Simon And Simons wifes mother was very ill with a burning heat and in answer to their prayers for her
Luk  He went near her and with a sharp word he gave orders to the disease and it went away from her and straight away she got up and took care of their needs
Luk  And at sundown all those who had anyone ill with any sort of disease took them to him and he put his hands on every one of them and made them well
Luk  And evil spirits came out of a number of them crying out and saying You are the Son of God But he gave them sharp orders not to say a word because they had knowledge that he was the Christ
Luk  And when it was day he came out and went to a waste place and great numbers of people came looking for him and they came to him and would have kept him from going away
Luk  But he said to them I have to give the good news of the kingdom of God in other towns because that is why I was sent
Luk  And he was teaching in the Synagogues of Galilee
Luk  Now it came about that while the people came pushing to be near him and to have knowledge of the word of God he was by a wide stretch of water named Gennesaret
Luk  And he saw two boats by the edge of the water but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets
Luk  And he got into one of the boats the property of Simon and made a request to him to go a little way out from the land And being seated he gave the people teaching from the boat
Luk  And when his talk was ended he said to Simon Go out into deep water and let down your nets for fish
Luk  And Simon answering said Master we were working all night and we took nothing but at your word I will let down the nets
Luk  And when they had done this they got such a great number of fish that it seemed as if their nets would be broken
Luk  And they made signs to their friends in the other boat to come to their help And they came and the two boats were so full that they were going down
Luk  But Simon when he saw it went down at the knees of Jesus and said Go away from me O Lord for I am a sinner
Luk  For he was full of wonder and so were all those who were with him at the number of fish which they had taken
Luk  And so were James and John the sons of Zebedee who were working with Simon And Jesus said to Simon Have no fear from this time forward you will be a fisher of men
Luk  And when they had got their boats to the land they gave up everything and went after him
Luk  And it came about that while he was in one of the towns there was a leper there and when he saw Jesus he went down on his face in prayer to him saying Lord if it is your pleasure you have power to make me clean
Luk  And he put out his hand to him and said It is my pleasure be clean And straight away his disease went from him
Luk  And he gave him orders Say nothing to any man but let the priest see you and give an offering so that you may be made clean as the law of Moses says and for a witness to them
Luk  But news of him went out all the more in every direction and great numbers of people came together to give hearing to his words and to be made well from their diseases
Luk  But he went away by himself to a waste place for prayer
Luk  And it came about that on one of these days he was teaching and some Pharisees and teachers of the law were seated there who had come from every town of Galilee and Judaea and from Jerusalem and the power of the Lord was with him to make those who were ill free from their diseases
Luk  And some men had with them on a bed a man who was ill without power of moving and they made attempts to get him in and put him before Jesus
Luk  And because of the mass of people there was no way to get him in so they went up on the top of the house and let him down through the roof on his bed into the middle in front of Jesus
Luk  And seeing their faith he said Man you have forgiveness for your sins
Luk  And the scribes and Pharisees were having an argument saying Who is this who has no respect for God who is able to give forgiveness for sins but God only
Luk  But Jesus who had knowledge of their thoughts said to them Why are you reasoning in your hearts
Luk  Which is the simpler to say You have forgiveness for your sins or to say Get up and go
Luk  But so that you may see that on earth the Son of man has authority for the forgiveness of sins he said to the man who was ill I say to you Get up and take up your bed and go into your house
Luk  And straight away he got up before them and took up his bed and went away to his house giving praise to God
Luk  And wonder overcame them all and they gave glory to God and they were full of fear saying We have seen strange things today
Luk  And after these things he went out and saw Levi a taxfarmer seated at the place where taxes were taken and said to him Come after me
Luk  And giving up his business he got up and went after him
Luk  And Levi made a great feast for him in his house and a great number of taxfarmers and others were seated at table with them
Luk  And the Pharisees and their scribes made protests against his disciples saying Why do you take food and drink with taxfarmers and sinners
Luk  And Jesus answering said to them Those who are well have no need of a medical man but those who are ill
Luk  I have come not to get the upright but sinners so that they may be turned from their sins
Luk  And they said to him The disciples of John frequently go without food and make prayers and so do the disciples of the Pharisees but your disciples take food and drink
Luk  And Jesus said Are you able to make the friends of the newlymarried man go without food when he is with them
Luk  But the days will come when he will be taken away from them and then they will go without food
Luk  And he said to them in a story No man takes a bit of cloth from a new coat and puts it on to an old coat for so the new coat would be damaged and the bit from the new would not go well with the old
Luk  And no man puts new wine into old wineskins for fear that the skins will be burst by the new wine and the wine be let out and the skins come to destruction
Luk  But new wine has to be put into new wineskins
Luk  And no man having had old wine has any desire for new for he says The old is better
Luk  Now it came about that on the Sabbath he was going through the fields of grain and his disciples took the heads of the grain for food crushing them in their hands
Luk  But some of the Pharisees said Why do you do what it is not right to do on the Sabbath
Luk  And Jesus said Have you not seen in the Writings what David did when he was in need of food he and those who were with him
Luk  How he went into the house of God and took for food the holy bread which only the priests may take and gave it to those who were with him
Luk  And he said The Son of man is lord even of the Sabbath
Luk  And it came about on another Sabbath that he went into the Synagogue and was teaching there And a man was there whose right hand was dead
Luk  And the scribes and Pharisees were watching him to see if he would make him well on the Sabbath so that they might be able to say something against him
Luk  But he had knowledge of their thoughts and he said to the man whose hand was dead Get up and come into the middle And he got up and came forward
Luk  And Jesus said I put the question to you Is it right to do good on the Sabbath or to do evil to give life or to take it away
Luk  And looking round on all of them he said to him Put out your hand And he did so and his hand was made well
Luk  But they were full of wrath and were talking together about what they might do to Jesus
Luk  And it came about in those days that he went out to the mountain for prayer and he was all night in prayer to God
Luk  And the day came and turning to his disciples he made a selection from among them of twelve to whom he gave the name of Apostles
Luk  Simon to whom he gave the name of Peter and Andrew his brother and James and John and Philip and Bartholomew
Luk  And Matthew and Thomas and James the son of Alphaeus and Simon who was named the Zealot
Luk  And Judas the son of James and Judas Iscariot he who was false to him
Luk  And he came down with them to a level place and a great band of his disciples and a very great number of people from all Judaea and Jerusalem and from the parts of Tyre and Sidon by the sea came to give hearing to him and to be made well from their diseases
Luk  And those who were troubled with unclean spirits were made well
Luk  And all the people were desiring to be touched by him for power came from him and made them all well
Luk  And turning his eyes to his disciples he said Happy are you who are poor for the kingdom of God is yours
Luk  Happy are you who are in need of food now for you will be made full Happy are you who are weeping now for you will be glad
Luk  Happy are you when men have hate for you and put you away from among them and say angry words to you turning away in disgust at your name because of the Son of man
Luk  Be glad in that day and be lifted up for joy for your reward in heaven will be great for their fathers did these same things to the prophets
Luk  But unhappy are you who have wealth for you have been comforted now
Luk  Unhappy are you who are full of food now for you will be in need Unhappy are you who are laughing now for you will be crying in sorrow
Luk  Unhappy are you when all men give you their approval for so their fathers did to the false prophets
Luk  But I say to you who give ear to me Have love for those who are against you do good to those who have hate for you
Luk  Give blessing to those who give you curses say prayers for those who are cruel to you
Luk  If a man gives you a blow on one side of your face then let the other side be turned to him from him who takes away your coat do not keep back your robe
Luk  Give to everyone who comes with a request and if a man takes away your property make no attempt to get it back again
Luk  Do to others as you would have them do to you
Luk  If you have love for those who have love for you what credit is it to you for even sinners have love for those who have love for them
Luk  And if you do good to those who do good to you what credit is it to you for even sinners do the same
Luk  And if you let those have the use of your money from whom you are hoping to get it back what credit is it to you even sinners do so to sinners hoping to get back as much as they gave
Luk  But be loving to those who are against you and do them good and give them your money not giving up hope and your reward will be great and you will be the sons of the Most High for he is kind to evil men and to those who have hard hearts
Luk  Be full of pity even as your Father is full of pity
Luk  Be not judges of others and you will not be judged do not give punishment to others and you will not get punishment yourselves make others free and you will be made free
Luk  Give and it will be given to you good measure crushed down full and running over they will give to you For in the same measure as you give it will be given to you again
Luk  And he gave them teaching in the form of a story saying Is it possible for one blind man to be guide to another will they not go falling together into a hole
Luk  The disciple is not greater than his master but everyone whose learning is complete will be like his master
Luk  And why do you take note of the grain of dust in your brothers eye but take no note of the bit of wood which is in your eye
Luk  How will you say to your brother Brother let me take the grain of dust out of your eye when you yourself do not see the bit of wood in your eye O false one first take the wood out of your eye and then you will see clearly to take the dust out of your brothers eye
Luk  For no good tree gives bad fruit and no bad tree gives good fruit
Luk  For every tree is judged by its fruit Men do not get figs from thorns or grapes from blackberry plants
Luk  The good man out of the good store of his heart gives good things and the evil man out of his evil store gives evil for out of the full store of the heart come the words of the mouth
Luk  Why do you say to me Lord Lord and do not the things which I say
Luk  Everyone who comes to me and gives ear to my words and does them I will make clear to you what he is like
Luk  He is like a man building a house who went deep and put the base of it on a rock and when the water came up and the river was driving against that house it was not moved because the building was good
Luk  But he who gives hearing without doing is like a man building a house on the earth without a base for it and when the force of the river came against it straight away it came down and the destruction of that house was great
Luk  After he had come to the end of all his words in the hearing of the people he went into Capernaum
Luk  And a certain captain had a servant who was very dear to him this servant was ill and near to death
Luk  And when news of Jesus came to his ears he sent to him rulers of the Jews requesting that he would come and make his servant well
Luk  And they when they came to Jesus made their request warmly saying
Luk  It is right for you to do this for him because he is a friend to our nation and himself has put up a Synagogue for us
Luk  And Jesus went with them And when he was not far from the house the man sent friends to him saying Lord do not give yourself trouble for I am not important enough for you to come into my house
Luk  And I had the feeling that I was not even good enough to come to you but say the word only and my servant will be well
Luk  For I myself am a man under authority having men under me and I say to this one Go and he goes and to another Come and he comes and to my servant Do this and he does it
Luk  And when these things were said to Jesus he was surprised and turning to the mass of people coming after him said I have not seen such great faith no not in Israel
Luk  And when those who were sent came back to the house they saw that the servant was well
Luk  And it came about after a little time that he went to a town named Nain and his disciples went with him and a great number of people
Luk  Now when he came near the door of the town a dead man was being taken out the only son of his mother who was a widow and a great number of people from the town were with her
Luk  And when the Lord saw her he had pity on her and said to her Be not sad
Luk  And he came near and put his hand on the stretcher where the dead man was and those who were moving it came to a stop And he said Young man I say to you Get up
Luk  And the dead man got up and words came from his lips And he gave him to his mother
Luk  And fear came on all and they gave praise to God saying A great prophet is among us and God has given thought to his people
Luk  And this story about him went through all Judaea and the places round about
Luk  And the disciples of John gave him an account of all these things
Luk  Then John sent two of his disciples to the Lord saying Are you he who is to come or are we waiting for another
Luk  And when the men came to him they said John the Baptist has sent us to you saying Are you he who is to come or are we waiting for another
Luk  At that time he made a number of people free from their diseases and their pains and from evil spirits and to others who were blind he gave back the use of their eyes
Luk  And answering them he said Go back and give news to John of what you have seen and the things which have come to your ears the blind now see those who had no power in their legs are walking lepers are made clean those who had no hearing now have their ears open dead men come to life again and the poor have the good news given to them
Luk  And a blessing will be on him who has no doubts about me
Luk  And when the men who were sent by John had gone away he said to the people about John What did you go out into the waste land to see a tall stem moving in the wind
Luk  But what did you go out to see a man in soft clothing See now those who have beautiful clothing and delicate food are in kings houses
Luk  But what did you go out to see a prophet Yes I say to you and more than a prophet
Luk  This is he of whom it has been said See I send my servant before your face who will make ready your way before you
Luk  I say to you Among all the sons of women not one is greater than John but he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he
Luk  And all the people and the taxfarmers to whom John had given baptism when they had knowledge of these things gave glory to God
Luk  But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were against the purpose of God for themselves not having had his baptism
Luk  What comparison am I to make of the men of this generation what are they like
Luk  They are like children who are seated in the marketplace crying out to one another and saying We made music for you but you did not take part in the dance we gave cries of sorrow but you were not sad
Luk  For John the Baptist came taking no food or drink and you say He has an evil spirit
Luk  The Son of man came feasting and you say Here is a lover of food and wine a friend of taxfarmers and sinners
Luk  But wisdom is judged to be right by all her children
Luk  And one of the Pharisees made a request that he would take a meal with him And he went into the Pharisees house and took his seat at the table
Luk  And there was a woman in the town who was a sinner and when she had news that he was a guest in the Pharisees house she took a bottle of perfume
Luk  And went in and took her place at the back of him near his feet weeping so that his feet were washed with the drops from her eyes and with her hair she made them dry and kissing his feet she put the perfume on them
Luk  Now when the Pharisee in whose house he was saw it he said to himself This man if he was a prophet would be conscious what sort of woman this is who has put her hands on him that she is a sinner
Luk  And Jesus answering said Simon I have something to say to you And he said Master say on
Luk  And he said Two men were in debt to a certain man of business one had a debt of five hundred pence and the other of fifty
Luk  When they were unable to make payment he made the two of them free of their debts Which of them now will have the greater love for him
Luk  Simon in answer said It seems he whose debt was greater And he said Your decision is right
Luk  And turning to the woman he said to Simon You see this woman I came into your house you did not give me water for my feet but she has been washing my feet with the drops from her eyes and drying them with her hair
Luk  You did not give me a kiss but she from the time when I came in has gone on kissing my feet
Luk  You put no oil on my head but she has put perfume on my feet
Luk  And so I say to you She will have forgiveness for her sins which are great in number because of her great love but he who has small need of forgiveness gives little love
Luk  And he said to her You have forgiveness for your sins
Luk  And those who were seated at table with him said to themselves Who is this who even gives forgiveness of sins
Luk  And he said to the woman By your faith you have salvation go in peace
Luk  And it came about after a short time that he went through town and country giving the good news of the kingdom of God and with him were the twelve
Luk  And certain women who had been made free from evil spirits and diseases Mary named Magdalene from whom seven evil spirits had gone out
Luk  And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herods chief houseservant and Susanna and a number of others who gave him of their wealth for his needs
Luk  And when a great number of people came together and men from every town went out to him he gave them teaching in the form of a story
Luk  A man went out to put in seed and while he was doing it some was dropped by the wayside and it was crushed under foot and was taken by the birds of heaven
Luk  And some went on the rock and when it came up it became dry and dead because it had no water
Luk  And some went among thorns and the thorns came up with it and it had no room for growth
Luk  And some falling on good earth came up and gave fruit a hundred times as much And with these words he said in a loud voice He who has ears let him give ear
Luk  And his disciples put questions to him about the point of the story
Luk  And he said To you is given knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God but to the others they are given in stories so that seeing they may not see and though they give hearing the sense will not be clear to them
Luk  Now this is the point of the story The seed is the word of God
Luk  Those by the side of the road are those who have given hearing then the Evil One comes and takes away the word from their hearts so that they may not have faith and get salvation
Luk  And those on the rock are those who with joy give hearing to the word but having no root they have faith for a time and when the test comes they give up
Luk  And those which went among thorns are those who have given hearing and go on their way but they are overcome by cares and wealth and the pleasures of life and they give no fruit
Luk  And those in the good earth are those who having given ear to the word keep it with a good and true heart and in quiet strength give fruit
Luk  No man when the light is lighted puts a cover over it or puts it under a bed but he puts it on its table so that those who come in may see the light
Luk  For nothing is put out of view which will not be made clear and nothing is secret of which the knowledge will not come to light
Luk  So take care how you give hearing for to him who has will be given and from him who has not will be taken even what he seems to have
Luk  And his mother and his brothers came to him and they were not able to get near him because of the great number of people
Luk  And someone said to him Your mother and your brothers are outside desiring to see you
Luk  But he said to them in answer My mother and my brothers are those who have knowledge of the word of God and do it
Luk  Now it came about on one of those days that he got into a boat with his disciples and he said to them Let us go over to the other side of the water and they put out the boat
Luk  But while they were sailing he went to sleep and a storm of wind came down on the sea and the boat became full of water and they were in danger
Luk  Then they came to him and awaking him out of his sleep said Master Master destruction is near And he when he was awake gave orders to the wind and the rolling waves and the storm came to an end and all was calm
Luk  And he said to them Where is your faith And fear and wonder overcame them and they said to one another Who then is this who gives orders even to the winds and the water and they do what he says
Luk  And they came to the country of the Gerasenes which is opposite Galilee
Luk  And when he had come to the land there came to him a certain man from the town who had evil spirits and for a long time he had had no clothing on and was not living in a house but in the place of the dead
Luk  And when he saw Jesus he gave a loud cry and went down on the earth before him and in a loud voice said What have I to do with you Jesus Son of the Most High God Do not be cruel to me
Luk  For he gave an order to the evil spirit to come out of the man For frequently it would take a grip of him and he was kept under control and prisoned with chains but parting the chains in two he would be sent by the driving of the evil spirit into waste places
Luk  And Jesus said to him What is your name And he said Legion for a number of spirits had gone into him
Luk  And they made a request to him that he would not give them an order to go away into the deep
Luk  Now there was a great herd of pigs in that place getting food on the mountain and the evil spirits made a request to him that he would let them go into the pigs and he let them
Luk  And the evil spirits came out of the man and went into the pigs and the herd went rushing down a sharp slope into the water and came to destruction
Luk  And when the men who took care of them saw what had come about they went quickly and gave news of it in the town and the country
Luk  And they went out to see what had taken place and they came to Jesus and saw the man out of whom the evil spirits had gone seated clothed and with full use of his senses at the feet of Jesus and fear came on them
Luk  And those who had seen it gave them an account of how the man who had the evil spirits was made well
Luk  And all the people of the country of the Gerasenes made a request to him to go away from them for they were in great fear and he got into a boat and went back
Luk  But the man from whom the evil spirits had gone out had a great desire to be with him but he sent him away saying
Luk  Go back to your house and let them have news of all the great things which God has done for you And he went away giving word through all the town of the great things which Jesus had done for him
Luk  And when Jesus went back the people were glad to see him for they were all waiting for him
Luk  Then there came a man named Jairus who was a ruler in the Synagogue and he went down at the feet of Jesus desiring him to come to his house
Luk  For he had an only daughter about twelve years old and she was near to death But while he was on his way the people were pushing to be near him
Luk  And a woman who had had a flow of blood for twelve years and had given all her money to medical men and not one of them was able to make her well
Luk  Came after him and put her hand on the edge of his robe and straight away the flowing of her blood was stopped
Luk  And Jesus said Who was touching me And when they all said It is not I Peter and those who were with him said Master the people are pushing round you on every side
Luk  But Jesus said Someone was touching me for I had the feeling that power had gone out from me
Luk  And when the woman saw that she was not able to keep it secret she came shaking with fear and falling down before him she made clear before all the people the reason for her touching him and how she was made well straight away
Luk  And he said to her Daughter your faith has made you well go in peace
Luk  While he was still talking someone came from the house of the ruler of the Synagogue saying Your daughter is dead do not go on troubling the Master
Luk  But Jesus at these words said to him Have no fear only have faith and she will be made well
Luk  And when he came to the house he did not let any man go in with him but only Peter and John and James and the father of the girl and her mother
Luk  And all the people were weeping and crying for her but he said Do not be sad for she is not dead but sleeping
Luk  And they were laughing at him being certain that she was dead
Luk  But he taking her hand said to her My child get up
Luk  And her spirit came back to her and she got up straight away and he gave orders that food was to be given to her
Luk  And her father and mother were full of wonder but he gave orders to them to say nothing about it to anyone
Luk  And getting the twelve together he gave them power and authority over all evil spirits and over diseases to make them well
Luk  And he sent them out to be preachers of the kingdom of God and to make well those who were ill
Luk  And he said to them Take nothing for your journey no stick or bag or bread or money and do not take two coats
Luk  And if you go into a house let that house be your restingplace till you go away
Luk  And if any people will not take you in when you go away from that town put off its dust from your feet for a witness against them
Luk  And they went away journeying through all the towns preaching the good news and making people free from diseases in all places
Luk  Now Herod the king had news of all these things and he was in doubt because it was said by some people that John had come back from the dead
Luk  And by some that Elijah had come and by others that one of the old prophets had come back to life
Luk  And Herod said I put John to death but who is this of whom such stories are given to me And he had a desire to see him
Luk  And the twelve when they came back gave him an account of what they had done And he took them with him and went away from the people to a town named Bethsaida
Luk  But the people getting news of it went after him and he was pleased to see them and gave them teaching about the kingdom of God and made those well who were in need of it
Luk  And the day went on and the twelve came to him and said Send these people away so that they may go into the towns and the country round about and get restingplaces and food for themselves for we are in a waste place
Luk  But he said Give them food yourselves And they said We have only five cakes of bread and two fishes if we do not go and get food for all these people
Luk  For there were about five thousand men And he said to his disciples Make them be seated in groups about fifty to a group
Luk  And they did so and made them all be seated
Luk  And he took the five cakes of bread and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he said words of blessing over them and when they had been broken he gave them to the disciples to give to the people
Luk  And they all took the food and had enough and they took up of the broken bits which were over twelve baskets full
Luk  And it came about that when he was in prayer by himself and the disciples were with him he put a question to them saying Who do the people say I am
Luk  And they answering said John the Baptist but others say Elijah and others that one of the old prophets has come back
Luk  And he said But who do you say that I am And Peter answering said The Christ of God
Luk  But he gave them special orders not to say this to any man
Luk  Saying The Son of man will undergo much and be put on one side by the rulers and the chief priests and the teachers of the law and be put to death and on the third day he will come back to life
Luk  And he said to them all If any man has a desire to come after me let him give up all and take up his cross every day and come after me
Luk  For whoever has a desire to keep his life will have it taken from him but whoever gives up his life because of me will keep it
Luk  For what profit will a man have if he gets all the world but undergoes loss or destruction himself
Luk  For if any man has a feeling of shame because of me or of my words the Son of man will have shame because of him when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels
Luk  But truly I say to you Some of those who are here now will have no taste of death till they see the kingdom of God
Luk  And about eight days after he had said these things he took Peter and John and James with him and went up into the mountain for prayer
Luk  And while he was in prayer his face was changed and his clothing became white and shining
Luk  And two men Moses and Elijah were talking with him
Luk  Who were seen in glory and were talking of his death which was about to take place in Jerusalem
Luk  Now Peter and those who were with him were overcome with sleep but when they were fully awake they saw his glory and the two men who were with him
Luk  And when they were about to go away from him Peter said to Jesus Master it is good for us to be here let us make three tents one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah having no knowledge of what he was saying
Luk  And while he said these things the shade of a cloud came over them and they were full of fear when they went into the cloud
Luk  And there was a voice from the cloud saying This is my Son the man of my selection give ear to him
Luk  And after the voice was gone they saw that Jesus was by himself And they kept quiet and said nothing at that time to anyone of the things which they had seen
Luk  And on the day after when they came down from the mountain a great band of people came to him
Luk  And a man from among them crying out said Master I make a request to you give a thought to my son for he is my only child
Luk  And see a spirit takes him and suddenly he gives a cry twisted in pain and streaming at the lips and when it goes away from him at last he is marked as from blows
Luk  And I made a request to your disciples to send it out of him but they were not able to do it
Luk  And Jesus said O generation without faith and false in heart how long will I have to be with you and put up with you let your son come here
Luk  And while he was coming he was pushed violently down and twisted by the evil spirit But Jesus gave sharp orders to the unclean spirit and made the boy well and gave him back to his father
Luk  And they were full of wonder at the great power of God But while they were all wondering at all the things which he did he said to his disciples
Luk  Let these words go deep into your ears for the Son of man will be given up into the hands of men
Luk  But this saying was not clear to them and its sense was kept secret from them so that they were not able to see it and they had fear of questioning him about it
Luk  Now there was a discussion among them about which of them would be the greatest
Luk  But when Jesus saw the reasoning of their hearts he took a small child and put him by his side
Luk  And said to them Whoever gives honour to this child in my name gives honour to me and whoever gives honour to me gives honour to him who sent me for whoever is least among you all that man is great
Luk  And John answering said Master we saw a man driving out evil spirits in your name and we did not let him do it because he was not one of us
Luk  But Jesus said to him Let him do it for he who is not against you is for you
Luk  And it came about that when the days were near for him to be taken up his face was turned to go to Jerusalem
Luk  And he sent men before and they came to a small town of Samaria to make ready for him
Luk  But they would not have him there because he was clearly going to Jerusalem
Luk  And when his disciples James and John saw this they said Lord may we send fire from heaven and put an end to them
Luk  But turning round he said sharp words to them
Luk  And they went to another small town
Luk  And when they were on the way a certain man said to him I will come after you wherever you go
Luk  And Jesus said to him Foxes have holes and the birds of the air have restingplaces but the Son of man has nowhere to put his head
Luk  And he said to another Come after me But he said Lord let me first go and give the last honours to my father
Luk  But he said to him Let the dead take care of their dead it is for you to go and give news of the kingdom of God
Luk  And another man said I will come with you Lord but first let me say a last goodday to those who are at my house
Luk  But Jesus said No man having put his hand to the plough and looking back is good enough for the kingdom of God
Luk  Now after these things the Lord made selection of seventy others and sent them before him two together into every town and place where he himself was about to come
Luk  And he said to them There is much grain ready to be cut but not enough workers so make prayer to the Lord of the grainfields that he will send workers to get in the grain
Luk  Go on your way see I send you out like lambs among wolves
Luk  Take no bag for money or for food and no shoes say no word to any man on the way
Luk  And whenever you go into a house first say Peace be to this house
Luk  And if a son of peace is there your peace will be with him but if not it will come back to you again
Luk  And keep in that same house taking what food and drink they give you for the worker has a right to his reward Do not go from house to house
Luk  And into whatever town you go if they take you in take whatever food is given to you
Luk  And make well those in it who are ill and say to them The kingdom of God is near to you
Luk  But if you go into a town where they will not have you go out into the streets of it and say
Luk  Even the dust of your town which is on our feet we put off as a witness against you but be certain of this that the kingdom of God is near
Luk  I say to you It will be better in that day for Sodom than for that town
Luk  A curse is on you Chorazin A curse is on you Bethsaida For if such works of power had been done in Tyre and Sidon as have been done in you they would have been turned from their sins in days gone by seated in the dust
Luk  But it will be better for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judging than for you
Luk  And you Capernaum were you not lifted up to heaven you will go down to hell
Luk  Whoever gives ear to you gives ear to me and whoever is against you is against me and whoever is against me is against him who sent me
Luk  And the seventy came back with joy saying Lord even the evil spirits are under our power in your name
Luk  And he said I was watching for Satan falling from heaven like a star
Luk  See I have given you power to put your feet on snakes and evil beasts and over all the strength of him who is against you and nothing will do you damage
Luk  Do not be glad however because you have power over spirits but because your names are recorded in heaven
Luk  In that same hour he was full of joy in the Holy Spirit and said I give praise to you O Father Lord of heaven and earth because you have kept these things secret from the wise and the men of learning and have made them clear to little children for so O Father it was pleasing in your eyes
Luk  All things have been given to me by my Father and no one has knowledge of the Son but only the Father and of the Father but only the Son and he to whom the Son will make it clear
Luk  And turning to the disciples he said privately Happy are the eyes which see the things you see
Luk  For I say to you that numbers of prophets and kings have had a desire to see the things which you see and have not seen them and to have knowledge of the things which have come to your ears and they had it not
Luk  And a certain teacher of the law got up and put him to the test saying Master what have I to do so that I may have eternal life
Luk  And he said to him What does the law say in your reading of it
Luk  And he answering said Have love for the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind and for your neighbour as for yourself
Luk  And he said You have given the right answer do this and you will have life
Luk  But he desiring to put himself in the right said to Jesus And who is my neighbour
Luk  And Jesus answering him said A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho and he got into the hands of thieves who took his clothing and gave him cruel blows and when they went away he was half dead
Luk  And by chance a certain priest was going down that way and when he saw him he went by on the other side
Luk  And in the same way a Levite when he came to the place and saw him went by on the other side
Luk  But a certain man of Samaria journeying that way came where he was and when he saw him he was moved with pity for him
Luk  And came to him and put clean linen round his wounds with oil and wine and he put him on his beast and took him to a house and took care of him
Luk  And the day after he took two pennies and gave them to the owner of the house and said Take care of him and if this money is not enough when I come again I will give you whatever more is needed
Luk  Which of these three men in your opinion was neighbour to the man who came into the hands of thieves
Luk  And he said The one who had mercy on him And Jesus said Go and do the same
Luk  Now while they were on their way he came to a certain town and a woman named Martha took him into her house
Luk  And she had a sister by name Mary who took her seat at the Lords feet and gave attention to his words
Luk  But Martha had her hands full of the work of the house and she came to him and said Lord is it nothing to you that my sister has let me do all the work Say to her that she is to give me some help
Luk  But the Lord answering said to her Martha Martha you are full of care and troubled about such a number of things
Luk  Little is needed or even one thing only for Mary has taken that good part which will not be taken away from her
Luk  And it came about that he was in prayer in a certain place and when he came to an end one of his disciples said to him Lord will you give us teaching about prayer as John did to his disciples
Luk  And he said to them When you say your prayers say Father may your name be kept holy and your kingdom come
Luk  Give us every day bread for our needs
Luk  May we have forgiveness for our sins as we make free all those who are in debt to us And let us not be put to the test
Luk  And he said to them Which of you having a friend would go to him in the middle of the night and say to him Friend let me have three cakes of bread
Luk  Because a friend of mine has come to me on a journey and I have nothing to put before him
Luk  And he from inside the house would say in answer Do not be a trouble to me the door is now shut and my children are with me in bed it is not possible for me to get up and give to you
Luk  I say to you Though he will not get up and give to him because he is his friend still if he keeps on making his request he will get up and give him as much as he has need of
Luk  And I say to you Make requests and they will be answered what you are searching for you will get when you give the sign the door will be open to you
Luk  For to everyone who makes a request it will be given and he who is searching will get his desire and to him who gives the sign the door will be open
Luk  And which of you being a father will give a stone to his son who makes request for bread or for a fish will give him a snake
Luk  Or for an egg will give him a scorpion
Luk  If then you who are evil are able to give good things to your children how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who make request to him
Luk  And he was sending an evil spirit out of a man who was without the power of talking And it came about that when the spirit had gone the man had the power of talking and the people were full of wonder
Luk  But some of them said He sends out evil spirits by Beelzebul the ruler of evil spirits
Luk  And others testing him were looking for a sign from heaven from him
Luk  But he having knowledge of their thoughts said to them Every kingdom in which there is division is made waste and a house in which there is division comes to destruction
Luk  If then Satan is at war with himself how will he keep his kingdom because you say that I send evil spirits out of men by the help of Beelzebul
Luk  And if I by Beelzebul send out evil spirits by whose help do your sons send them out so let them be your judges
Luk  But if I by the finger of God send out evil spirits then the kingdom of God has overtaken you
Luk  When the strong man armed keeps watch over his house then his goods are safe
Luk  But when one who is stronger makes an attack on him and overcomes him he takes away his instruments of war in which he had put his faith and makes division of his goods
Luk  He who is not with me is against me and he who will not give me help in getting people together is driving them away
Luk  The unclean spirit when he has gone out of a man goes through dry places looking for rest and when he does not get it he says I will go back to my house from which I came
Luk  And when he comes he sees that it has been made fair and clean
Luk  Then he goes and gets seven other spirits more evil than himself and they go in and take their places there and the last condition of that man is worse than the first
Luk  And it came about that when he said these things a certain woman among the people said in a loud voice Happy is the body which gave you birth and the breasts from which you took milk
Luk  But he said More happy are they who give hearing to the word of God and keep it
Luk  And when a great number of people came together to him he said This generation is an evil generation it is looking for a sign and no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah
Luk  For even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites so will the Son of man be to this generation
Luk  The queen of the South will come up on the day of judging and give her decision against the men of this generation for she came from the ends of the earth to give ear to the wisdom of Solomon and now something greater than Solomon is here
Luk  The men of Nineveh will come up in the day of judging and give their decision against this generation for they were turned away from their sins at the preaching of Jonah but now something greater than Jonah is here
Luk  No man when the light has been lighted puts it in a secret place or under a vessel but on its table so that those who come in may see the light
Luk  The light of the body is the eye when your eye is true all your body is full of light but when it is evil your body is dark
Luk  So take care that the light which is in you is not dark
Luk  If then all your body is light with no part of it dark it will be completely full of light as when a flame with its bright shining gives you light
Luk  Now while he was talking a Pharisee made a request that he would come to a meal with him and he went in and took his seat at the meal
Luk  And when the Pharisee saw it he was surprised because he came to the meal without first washing himself
Luk  And the Lord said to him You Pharisees make the outside of the cup and the plate clean but inside you are thieves and full of evil
Luk  O you foolish ones did not he who made the outside in the same way make the inside
Luk  But if you give to the poor such things as you are able then all things are clean to you
Luk  But a curse is on you Pharisees for you make men give a tenth of every sort of plant and give no thought to right and the love of God but it is right for you to do these things and not let the others be undone
Luk  A curse is on you Pharisees for your desires are for the most important seats in the Synagogues and for words of respect said to you in the marketplace
Luk  A curse is on you for you are like the restingplaces of dead men which are not seen and men go walking over them without knowledge of it
Luk  And one of the teachers of the law answering said to him Master in saying this you give a bad name to us as to them
Luk  And he said A curse is on you teachers of the law for while other men are crushed under the weight of the rules you make for them you yourselves do not put so much as one finger to them
Luk  A curse is on you for you make restingplaces for the bodies of the prophets but your fathers put them to death
Luk  So you are witnesses and give approval to the work of your fathers for they put them to death and you make their last restingplaces
Luk  For this reason the wisdom of God has said I will send them prophets and teachers and to some of them they will give death and cruel pains
Luk  So that punishment may come on this generation for the blood of all the prophets which was given from the earliest days
Luk  From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah who was put to death between the altar and the Temple Yes I say to you It will come on this generation
Luk  A curse is on you teachers of the law for you have taken away the key of knowledge you did not go in yourselves and you got in the way of those who were going in
Luk  And when he had come out of that place the scribes and the Pharisees came round him angrily questioning him about more things
Luk  And watching him for a chance to get something from his words which might be used against him
Luk  At that time when thousands of the people had come together in such numbers that they were crushing one another he said first to his disciples Have nothing to do with the leaven of the Pharisees which is deceit
Luk  But nothing is covered up which will not come to light or secret which will not be made clear
Luk  So whatever you have said in the dark will come to mens hearing in the light and what you have said secretly inside the house will be made public from the housetops
Luk  And I say to you my friends Have no fear of those who may put the body to death and are able to do no more than that
Luk  But I will make clear to you of whom you are to be in fear of him who after death has power to send you to hell yes truly I say Have fear of him
Luk  Are not five sparrows given in exchange for two farthings and God has every one of them in mind
Luk  But even the hairs of your head are numbered Have no fear you are of more value than a flock of sparrows
Luk  And I say to you that to everyone who gives witness to me before men the Son of man will give witness before the angels of God
Luk  But if anyone says before men that he has no knowledge of me I will say that I have no knowledge of him before the angels of God
Luk  And if anyone says a word against the Son of man he will have forgiveness but for him who says evil words against the Holy Spirit there will be no forgiveness
Luk  And when they take you before the Synagogues and the authorities and the rulers take no thought about what answers you will give or what you will say
Luk  For the Holy Spirit will make clear to you in that very hour what to say
Luk  And one of the people said to him Master give an order to my brother to make division of the heritage with me
Luk  But he said Man who made me a judge or a maker of decisions for you
Luk  And he said to them Take care to keep yourselves free from the desire for property for a mans life is not made up of the number of things which he has
Luk  And he said to them in a story The land of a certain man of great wealth was very fertile
Luk  And he said to himself What is to be done for I have no place in which to put all my fruit
Luk  And he said This I will do I will take down my storehouses and make greater ones and there I will put all my grain and my goods
Luk  And I will say to my soul Soul you have a great amount of goods in store enough for a number of years be at rest take food and wine and be happy
Luk  But God said to him You foolish one tonight I will take your soul from you and who then will be the owner of all the things which you have got together
Luk  So that is what comes to the man who gets wealth for himself and has not wealth in the eyes of God
Luk  And he said to his disciples For this reason I say to you Take no thought for your life about what food you will take or for your body how it may be clothed
Luk  Is not life more than food and the body than its clothing
Luk  Give thought to the ravens they do not put seeds into the earth or get together grain they have no storehouses or buildings and God gives them their food of how much greater value are you than the birds
Luk  And which of you by taking thought is able to make himself any taller
Luk  If then you are not able to do even that which is least why are you troubled about the rest
Luk  Give thought to the flowers they do no work they make no thread and still I say to you Even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these
Luk  But if God gives such clothing to the grass in the field which today is living and tomorrow will be burned in the oven how much more will he give clothing to you O men of little faith
Luk  And do not give overmuch thought to your food and drink and let not your mind be full of doubts
Luk  For the nations of the world go in search of all these things but your Father has knowledge that you have need of them
Luk  But let your chief care be for his kingdom and these other things will be given to you in addition
Luk  Have no fear little flock for it is your Fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom
Luk  Give what property you have in exchange for money and give the money to the poor make for yourselves moneybags which will not get old wealth stored up in heaven which will be yours for ever where thieves will not come nor worms put it to destruction
Luk  For where your wealth is there will your heart be
Luk  Be ready dressed as for a journey with your lights burning
Luk  And be like men who are looking for their lord when he comes back from the bridefeast so that when he comes to the door it will be open to him quickly
Luk  Happy are those servants who are watching when the lord comes truly I say to you he will make himself their servant and placing them at the table he will come out and give them food
Luk  And if he comes in the second division of the night or in the third and they are watching for him happy are those servants
Luk  But be certain of this that if the master of the house had had knowledge of the time when the thief was coming he would have been watching and would not have let his house be broken into
Luk  So be ready for the Son of man is coming at a time when you are not looking for him
Luk  And Peter said to him Lord are these words said to us only or to all men
Luk  And the Lord said Who then is the wise and responsible servant whom his lord will put in control of his family to give them their food at the right time
Luk  Happy is that servant who when his lord comes is doing so
Luk  Truly I say to you he will put him in control of all his goods
Luk  But if that servant says to himself My lord is a long time coming and goes about giving blows to the menservants and the womenservants feasting and taking overmuch wine
Luk  The lord of that servant will come at a time when he is not looking for him and at an hour when he is not ready for him and he will have him cut in two and will give him his part in the fate of those who have no faith
Luk  And the servant who had knowledge of his lords desires and was not ready for him and did not do as he was ordered will be given a great number of blows
Luk  But he who without knowledge did things for which punishment is given will get only a small number of blows The man to whom much is given will have to give much if much is given into his care of him more will be requested
Luk  I came to send a fire on the earth and it may even now have been lighted
Luk  But there is a baptism which I have to undergo and how am I kept back till it is complete
Luk  Is it your opinion that I have come to give peace on earth I say to you No but division
Luk  For from this time a family of five in one house will be on opposite sides three against two and two against three
Luk  They will be at war the father against his son and the son against his father mother against daughter and daughter against mother motherinlaw against daughterinlaw and daughterinlaw against motherinlaw
Luk  Then he said to the people When you see a cloud coming up in the west straight away you say There will be rain and so it is
Luk  And when you see a south wind blowing you say There will be heat and so it is
Luk  O false ones the face of the earth and the heaven is clear to you how is it that the signs of these times are not as clear to you
Luk  And why are you in your hearts unable to be judges of what is right
Luk  For if anyone has a cause at law against you and you are going with him before the ruler make an attempt on the way to come to an agreement with him for if you do not he may take you before the judge and the judge will give you up to the police and they will put you in prison
Luk  I say to you You will not come out of it till you have made payment to the very last farthing
Luk  Now some people who were there at that time gave him an account of how the blood of some Galilaeans had been mixed by Pilate with their offerings
Luk  And he in answer said to them Are you of the opinion that these Galilaeans were worse than all other Galilaeans because these things were done to them
Luk  I say to you It is not so but if your hearts are not changed you will all come to the same end
Luk  Or those eighteen men who were crushed by the fall of the tower of Siloam were they worse than all the other men living in Jerusalem
Luk  I say to you It is not so but if your hearts are not changed you will all come to an end in the same way
Luk  And he made up this story for them A certain man had a figtree in his garden and he came to get fruit from it and there was no fruit
Luk  And he said to the gardener See for three years I have been looking for fruit from this tree and I have not had any let it be cut down why is it taking up space
Luk  And he said Lord let it be for this year and I will have the earth turned up round it and put animal waste on it to make it fertile
Luk  And if after that it has fruit it is well if not let it be cut down
Luk  And he was teaching in one of the Synagogues on the Sabbath
Luk  And there was a woman who had had a disease for eighteen years she was bent and was not able to make herself straight
Luk  And when Jesus saw her he said to her Woman you are made free from your disease
Luk  And he put his hands on her and she was made straight and gave praise to God
Luk  And the ruler of the Synagogue was angry because Jesus had made her well on the Sabbath and he said to the people There are six days in which men may do work so come on those days to be made well and not on the Sabbath
Luk  But the Lord gave him an answer and said O you false men do you not every one of you on the Sabbath let loose his ox and his ass and take it to the water
Luk  And is it not right for this daughter of Abraham who has been in the power of Satan for eighteen years to be made free on the Sabbath
Luk  And when he said these things those who were against him were shamed and all the people were full of joy because of the great things which were done by him
Luk  Then he said What is the kingdom of God like what comparison may I make of it
Luk  It is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and put in his garden and it became a tree and the birds of heaven made their restingplaces in its branches
Luk  And again he said What is the kingdom of God like
Luk  It is like leaven which a woman put into three measures of meal and it was all leavened
Luk  And he went on his way through towns and country places teaching and journeying to Jerusalem
Luk  And someone said to him Lord will only a small number have salvation And he said to them
Luk  Do your best to go in by the narrow door for I say to you A number will make the attempt to go in but will not be able to do so
Luk  When the master of the house has got up and the door has been shut and you still outside give blows on the door saying Lord let us in he will make answer and say I have no knowledge of where you come from
Luk  Then you will say We have taken food and drink with you and you were teaching in our streets
Luk  But he will say Truly I have no knowledge of you or where you come from go away from me you workers of evil
Luk  There will be weeping and cries of sorrow when you see Abraham Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God but you yourselves are shut outside
Luk  And they will come from the east and from the west from the north and from the south and take their places in the kingdom of God
Luk  And the last will be first and the first will be last
Luk  At that time certain Pharisees came to him and said Go away from this place because Herods purpose is to put you to death
Luk  And he said Go and say to that fox I send out evil spirits and do works of mercy today and tomorrow and on the third day my work will be complete
Luk  But I have to go on my way today and tomorrow and the third day for it is not right for a prophet to come to his death outside Jerusalem
Luk  O Jerusalem Jerusalem putting to death the prophets and stoning those who were sent to her again and again would I have taken your children to myself as a bird takes her young ones under her wings but you would not
Luk  Now see your house is waste and I say to you You will not see me again till you say A blessing on him who comes in the name of the Lord
Luk  And it came about that when he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees on the Sabbath to have a meal they were watching him
Luk  And a certain man was there who had a disease
Luk  And Jesus answering said to the scribes and Pharisees Is it right to make people well on the Sabbath or not
Luk  But they said nothing And he made him well and sent him away
Luk  And he said to them Which of you whose ox or ass has got into a waterhole will not straight away get him out on the Sabbath
Luk  And they had no answer to that question
Luk  And he gave teaching in the form of a story to the guests who came to the feast when he saw how they took the best seats saying to them
Luk  When you get a request to come to a feast do not take the best seat for a more important man than you may be coming
Luk  And then the giver of the feast will come to you and say Give your place to this man and you with shame will have to take the lowest seat
Luk  But when you come go and take the lowest seat so that when the giver of the feast comes he may say to you Friend come up higher and then you will have honour in the eyes of all the others who are there
Luk  For every man who gives himself a high place will be put down but he who takes a low place will be lifted up
Luk  And he said to the master of the house When you give a feast do not send for your friends and your brothers and your family or your neighbours who have wealth for they may give a feast for you and so you will get a reward
Luk  But when you give a feast send for the poor and the blind and those who are broken in body
Luk  And you will have a blessing because they will not be able to give you any payment and you will get your reward when the upright come back from the dead
Luk  And hearing these words one of those who were at table with him said to him Happy is the man who will be a guest in the kingdom of God
Luk  And he said to them A certain man gave a great feast and sent word of it to a number of people
Luk  And when the time had come he sent his servants to say to them Come for all things are now ready
Luk  And they all gave reasons why they were not able to come The first said to him I have got a new field and it is necessary for me to go and see it I am full of regret that I am unable to come
Luk  And another said I have got some cattle and I am going to make a test of them I am full of regret that I am unable to come
Luk  And another said I have been married and so I am not able to come
Luk  And the servant came back and gave his master an account of these things Then the master of the house was angry and said to the servant Go out quickly into the streets of the town and get the poor the blind and those who are broken in body
Luk  And the servant said Lord your orders have been done and still there is room
Luk  And the lord said to the servant Go out into the roads and the fields and make them come in so that my house may be full
Luk  For I say to you that not one of those who were requested to come will have a taste of my feast
Luk  Now a great number of people went with him
Luk  And turning round he said to them If any man comes to me and has not hate for his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters and even for his life he may not be my disciple
Luk  Whoever does not take up his cross and come after me may not be my disciple
Luk  For which of you desiring to put up a tower does not first give much thought to the price if he will have enough to make it complete
Luk  For fear that if he makes a start and is not able to go on with it to the end all who see it will be laughing at him
Luk  And saying This man made a start at building and is not able to make it complete
Luk  Or what king going to war with another king will not first take thought if he will be strong enough with ten thousand men to keep off him who comes against him with twenty thousand
Luk  Or while the other is still a great distance away he sends representatives requesting conditions of peace
Luk  And so whoever is not ready to give up all he has may not be my disciple
Luk  For salt is good but if the taste goes from it of what use is it
Luk  It is no good for the land or for the place of waste no one has a use for it He who has ears let him give ear
Luk  Now all the taxfarmers and sinners came near to give ear to him
Luk  And the Pharisees and scribes were angry saying This man gives approval to sinners and takes food with them
Luk  And he made a story for them saying
Luk  What man of you having a hundred sheep if one of them gets loose and goes away will not let the ninetynine be in the waste land by themselves and go after the wandering one till he sees where it is
Luk  And when he has got it again he takes it in his arms with joy
Luk  And when he gets back to his house he sends for his neighbours and friends saying to them Be glad with me for I have got back my sheep which had gone away
Luk  I say to you that even so there will be more joy in heaven when one sinner is turned away from his wrongdoing than for ninetynine good men who have no need of a change of heart
Luk  Or what woman having ten bits of silver if one bit has gone from her hands will not get a light and go through her house searching with care till she sees it
Luk  And when she has it again she gets her friends and neighbours together saying Be glad with me for I have got back the bit of silver which had gone from me
Luk  Even so I say to you There is joy among the angels of God when one sinner is turned away from his wrongdoing
Luk  And he said A certain man had two sons
Luk  And the younger of them said to his father Father give me that part of your property which will be mine And he made division of his goods between them
Luk  And not long after the younger son got together everything which was his and took a journey into a faraway country and there all his money went in foolish living
Luk  And when everything was gone there was no food to be had in that country and he was in need
Luk  And he went and put himself into the hands of one of the people of that country and he sent him into his fields to give the pigs their food
Luk  And so great was his need that he would have been glad to take the pigs food and no one gave him anything
Luk  But when he came to his senses he said What numbers of my fathers servants have bread enough and more while I am near to death here through need of food
Luk  I will get up and go to my father and will say to him Father I have done wrong against heaven and in your eyes
Luk  I am no longer good enough to be named your son make me like one of your servants
Luk  And he got up and went to his father But while he was still far away his father saw him and was moved with pity for him and went quickly and took him in his arms and gave him a kiss
Luk  And his son said to him Father I have done wrong against heaven and in your eyes I am no longer good enough to be named your son
Luk  But the father said to his servants Get out the first robe quickly and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet
Luk  And get the fat young ox and put it to death and let us have a feast and be glad
Luk  For this my son who was dead is living again he had gone away from me and has come back And they were full of joy
Luk  Now the older son was in the field and when he came near the house the sounds of music and dancing came to his ears
Luk  And he sent for one of the servants questioning him about what it might be
Luk  And he said to him Your brother has come and your father has had the young ox put to death because he has come back safely
Luk  But he was angry and would not go in and his father came out and made a request to him to come in
Luk  But he made answer and said to his father See all these years I have been your servant doing your orders in everything and you never gave me even a young goat so that I might have a feast with my friends
Luk  But when this your son came who has been wasting your property with bad women you put to death the fat young ox for him
Luk  And he said to him Son you are with me at all times and all I have is yours
Luk  But it was right to be glad and to have a feast for this your brother who was dead is living again he had gone away and has come back
Luk  And another time he said to the disciples There was a certain man of great wealth who had a servant and it was said to him that this servant was wasting his goods
Luk  And he sent for him and said What is this which is said about you give me an account of all you have done for you will no longer be the manager of my property
Luk  And the servant said to himself What am I to do now that my lord takes away my position I have not enough strength for working in the fields and I would be shamed if I made requests for money from people in the streets
Luk  I have come to a decision what to do so that when I am put out of my position they will take me into their houses
Luk  And sending for every one who was in debt to his lord he said to the first What is the amount of your debt to my lord
Luk  And he said A hundred measures of oil And he said Take your account straight away and put down fifty
Luk  Then he said to another What is the amount of your debt And he said A hundred measures of grain And he said to him Take your account and put down eighty
Luk  And his lord was pleased with the false servant because he had been wise for the sons of this world are wiser in relation to their generation than the sons of light
Luk  And I say to you Make friends for yourselves through the wealth of this life so that when it comes to an end you may be taken into the eternal restingplaces
Luk  He who is true in a little is true in much he who is false in small things is false in great
Luk  If then you have not been true in your use of the wealth of this life who will give into your care the true wealth
Luk  And if you have not been true in your care of the property of other people who will give you that which is yours
Luk  No man may be a servant to two masters for he will have hate for the one and love for the other or he will keep to the one and have no respect for the other You may not be servants of God and of wealth
Luk  And the Pharisees who had a great love of money hearing these things were making sport of him
Luk  And he said You take care to seem right in the eyes of men but God sees your hearts and those things which are important in the opinion of men are evil in the eyes of God
Luk  The law and the prophets were till John but then came the preaching of the kingdom of God and everyone makes his way into it by force
Luk  But heaven and earth will come to an end before the smallest letter of the law may be dropped out
Luk  Everyone who puts away his wife and takes another is a false husband and he who is married to a woman whose husband has put her away is no true husband to her
Luk  Now there was a certain man of great wealth who was dressed in fair clothing of purple and delicate linen and was shining and glad every day
Luk  And a certain poor man named Lazarus was stretched out at his door full of wounds
Luk  Desiring the broken bits of food which came from the table of the man of wealth and even the dogs came and put their tongues on his wounds
Luk  And in time the poor man came to his end and angels took him to Abrahams breast And the man of wealth came to his end and was put in the earth
Luk  And in hell being in great pain lifting up his eyes he saw Abraham far away and Lazarus on his breast
Luk  And he gave a cry and said Father Abraham have mercy on me and send Lazarus so that he may put the end of his finger in water and put it on my tongue for I am cruelly burning in this flame
Luk  But Abraham said Keep in mind my son that when you were living you had your good things while Lazarus had evil things but now he is comforted and you are in pain
Luk  And in addition there is a deep division fixed between us and you so that those who might go from here to you are not able to do so and no one may come from you to us
Luk  And he said Father it is my request that you will send him to my fathers house
Luk  For I have five brothers and let him give them an account of these things so that they may not come to this place of pain
Luk  But Abraham said They have Moses and the prophets let them give ear to what they say
Luk  And he said No father Abraham but if someone went to them from the dead their hearts would be changed
Luk  And he said to him If they will not give attention to Moses and the prophets they will not be moved even if someone comes back from the dead
Luk  And he said to his disciples It is necessary for causes of trouble to come about but unhappy is he by whom they come
Luk  It would be well for him if a great stone was put round his neck and he was dropped into the sea before he made trouble for any of these little ones
Luk  Give attention to yourselves if your brother does wrong say a sharp word to him and if he has sorrow for his sin let him have forgiveness
Luk  And if he does you wrong seven times in a day and seven times comes to you and says I have regret for what I have done let him have forgiveness
Luk  And the twelve said to the Lord Make our faith greater
Luk  And the Lord said If your faith was only as great as a grain of mustard seed you might say to this tree Be rooted up and planted in the sea and it would be done
Luk  But which of you having a servant who is ploughing or keeping sheep will say to him when he comes in from the field Come now and be seated and have a meal
Luk  Will he not say Get a meal for me and make yourself ready and see to my needs till I have had my food and drink and after that you may have yours
Luk  Does he give praise to the servant because he did what was ordered
Luk  In the same way when you have done all the things which are given you to do say There is no profit in us for we have only done what we were ordered to do
Luk  And it came about that when they were on the way to Jerusalem he went through Samaria and Galilee
Luk  And when he went into a certain small town he came across ten men who were lepers and they keeping themselves at a distance
Luk  Said in loud voices Jesus Master have mercy on us
Luk  And when he saw them he said Go and let the priests see you And while they were going they were made clean
Luk  And one of them when he saw that he was clean turning back gave praise to God in a loud voice
Luk  And falling down on his face at the feet of Jesus he gave the credit to him and he was a man of Samaria
Luk  And Jesus said Were there not ten men who were made clean where are the nine
Luk  Have not any of them come back to give glory to God but only this one from a strange land
Luk  And he said to him Get up and go on your way your faith has made you well
Luk  And when the Pharisees put questions to him about when the kingdom of God would come he gave them an answer and said The kingdom of God will not come through observation
Luk  And men will not say See it is here or There for the kingdom of God is among you
Luk  And he said to his disciples The time will come when you will have a great desire to see one of the days of the Son of man but you will not see it
Luk  And if they say to you See it is there or It is here do not go away or go after them
Luk  For as in a thunderstorm the bright light is seen from one end of the sky to the other so will the Son of man be when his time comes
Luk  But first he will have to undergo much and be put on one side by this generation
Luk  And as it was in the days of Noah so will it be in the day of the Son of man
Luk  They were feasting and taking wives and getting married till the day of the overflowing of the waters when Noah went into the ark and they all came to destruction
Luk  In the same way in the days of Lot they were feasting and trading they were planting and building
Luk  But on the day when Lot went out of Sodom fire came down from heaven and destruction came on them all
Luk  So will it be in the day of the revelation of the Son of man
Luk  On that day if anyone is on the roof of the house and his goods are in the house let him not go down to take them away and let him who is in the field not go back to his house
Luk  Keep in mind Lots wife
Luk  If anyone makes an attempt to keep his life it will be taken from him but if anyone gives up his life he will keep it
Luk  I say to you In that night there will be two men sleeping in one bed and one will be taken away and the other let go
Luk  Two women will be crushing grain together one will be taken away and the other let go
Luk  
Luk  And they answering him said Where Lord And he said to them Where the body is there will the eagles come together
Luk  And he made a story for them the point of which was that men were to go on making prayer and not get tired
Luk  Saying There was a judge in a certain town who had no fear of God or respect for man
Luk  And there was a widow in that town and she kept on coming to him and saying Give me my right against the man who has done me wrong
Luk  And for a time he would not but later he said to himself Though I have no fear of God or respect for man
Luk  Because this widow is a trouble to me I will give her her right for if not I will be completely tired out by her frequent coming
Luk  And the Lord said Give ear to the words of the evil judge
Luk  And will not God do right in the cause of his saints whose cries come day and night to his ears though he is long in doing it
Luk  I say to you that he will quickly do right in their cause But when the Son of man comes will there be any faith on earth
Luk  And he made this story for some people who were certain that they were good and had a low opinion of others
Luk  Two men went up to the Temple for prayer one a Pharisee and the other a taxfarmer
Luk  The Pharisee taking up his position said to himself these words God I give you praise because I am not like other men who take more than their right who are evildoers who are untrue to their wives or even like this taxfarmer
Luk  Twice in the week I go without food I give a tenth of all I have
Luk  The taxfarmer on the other hand keeping far away and not lifting up even his eyes to heaven made signs of grief and said God have mercy on me a sinner
Luk  I say to you This man went back to his house with Gods approval and not the other for everyone who makes himself high will be made low and whoever makes himself low will be made high
Luk  And they took their children to him so that he might put his hands on them but when the disciples saw it they said sharp words to them
Luk  But Jesus sent for them saying Let the children come to me and do not keep them away for of such is the kingdom of heaven
Luk  Truly I say to you Whoever does not put himself under the kingdom of God like a little child will not come into it at all
Luk  And a certain ruler put a question to him saying Good Master what have I to do so that I may have eternal life
Luk  And Jesus said to him Why do you say that I am good No one is good but only God
Luk  You have knowledge of what the law says Do not be untrue to your wife Do not put anyone to death Do not take what is not yours Do not give false witness Give honour to your father and mother
Luk  And he said All these things I have done from the time when I was a boy
Luk  And Jesus hearing it said to him One thing you still have need of get money for your goods and give it away to the poor and you will have wealth in heaven and come after me
Luk  But at these words he became very sad for he had great wealth
Luk  And Jesus looking at him said How hard it is for those who have wealth to get into the kingdom of God
Luk  It is simpler for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a man who has much money to come into the kingdom of God
Luk  And those who were present said Then who may have salvation
Luk  But he said Things which are not possible with man are possible with God
Luk  And Peter said See we have given up what is ours to come after you
Luk  And he said to them Truly I say to you There is no man who has given up house or wife or brothers or father or mother or children because of the kingdom of God
Luk  Who will not get much more in this time and in the world to come eternal life
Luk  And he took with him the twelve and said to them Now we are going up to Jerusalem and all the things which were said by the prophets will be done to the Son of man
Luk  For he will be given up to the Gentiles and will be made sport of and put to shame
Luk  And he will be given cruel blows and put to death and on the third day he will come back to life
Luk  But they did not take in the sense of any of these words and what he said was not clear to them and their minds were not able to see it
Luk  And it came about that when he got near Jericho a certain blind man was seated by the side of the road making requests for money from those who went by
Luk  And hearing the sound of a great number of people going by he said What is this
Luk  And they said to him Jesus of Nazareth is going by
Luk  And he said in a loud voice Jesus Son of David have mercy on me
Luk  And those who were in front made protests and said to him Be quiet but he said all the more O Son of David have mercy on me
Luk  And Jesus stopping gave orders that he was to come to him and when he came near he said to him
Luk  What would you have me do for you And he said Lord that I may be able to see again
Luk  And Jesus said See again your faith has made you well
Luk  And straight away he was able to see and he went after him giving glory to God and all the people when they saw it gave praise to God
Luk  And he went into Jericho and when he was going through it
Luk  A man named Zacchaeus who was the chief taxfarmer and a man of wealth
Luk  Made an attempt to get a view of Jesus and was not able to do so because of the people for he was a small man
Luk  And he went quickly in front of them and got up into a tree to see him for he was going that way
Luk  And when Jesus came to the place looking up he said to him Zacchaeus be quick and come down for I am coming to your house today
Luk  And he came down quickly and took him into his house with joy
Luk  And when they saw it they were all angry saying He has gone into the house of a sinner
Luk  And Zacchaeus waiting before him said to the Lord See Lord half of my goods I give to the poor and if I have taken anything from anyone wrongly I give him back four times as much
Luk  And Jesus said to him Today salvation has come to this house for even he is a son of Abraham
Luk  For the Son of man came to make search for those who are wandering from the way and to be their Saviour
Luk  And while they were giving ear to these words he made another story for them because he was near Jerusalem and because they were of the opinion that the kingdom of God was coming straight away
Luk  So he said A certain man of high birth went into a faraway country to get a kingdom for himself and to come back
Luk  And he sent for ten of his servants and gave them ten pounds and said to them Do business with this till I come
Luk  But his people had no love for him and sent representatives after him saying We will not have this man for our ruler
Luk  And when he came back again having got his kingdom he gave orders for those servants to whom he had given the money to come to him so that he might have an account of what business they had done
Luk  And the first came before him saying Lord your pound has made ten pounds
Luk  And he said to him You have done well O good servant because you have done well in a small thing you will have authority over ten towns
Luk  And another came saying Your pound has made five pounds
Luk  And he said You will be ruler over five towns
Luk  And another came saying Lord here is your pound which I put away in a cloth
Luk  Because I was in fear of you for you are a hard man you take up what you have not put down and get in grain where you have not put seed
Luk  He said to him By the words of your mouth you will be judged you bad servant You had knowledge that I am a hard man taking up what I have not put down and getting in grain where I have not put seed
Luk  Why then did you not put my money in a bank so that when I came I would get it back with interest
Luk  And he said to the others who were near Take the pound away from him and give it to the man who has ten
Luk  And they say to him Lord he has ten pounds
Luk  And I say to you that to everyone who has more will be given but from him who has not even what he has will be taken away
Luk  And as for those who were against me who would not have me for their ruler let them come here and be put to death before me
Luk  And when he had said this he went on in front of them going up to Jerusalem
Luk  And it came about that when he got near Bethphage and Bethany by the mountain which is named the Mountain of Olives he sent two of the disciples
Luk  Saying Go into the little town in front of you and on going in you will see a young ass fixed with a cord on which no man has ever been seated let him loose and take him
Luk  And if anyone says to you Why are you taking him say The Lord has need of him
Luk  And those whom he sent went away and it was as he said
Luk  And when they were getting the young ass the owners of it said to them Why are you taking the young ass
Luk  And they said The Lord has need of him
Luk  And they took him to Jesus and they put their clothing on the ass and Jesus got on to him
Luk  And while he went on his way they put their clothing down on the road in front of him
Luk  And when he came near the foot of the Mountain of Olives all the disciples with loud voices gave praise to God with joy because of all the great works which they had seen
Luk  Saying A blessing on the King who comes in the name of the Lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest
Luk  And some of the Pharisees among the people said to him Master make your disciples be quiet
Luk  And he said in answer I say to you if these men keep quiet the very stones will be crying out
Luk  And when he got near and saw the town he was overcome with weeping for it
Luk  Saying If you even you had knowledge today of the things which give peace but you are not able to see them
Luk  For the time will come when your attackers will put a wall round you and come all round you and keep you in on every side
Luk  And will make you level with the earth and your children with you and there will not be one stone resting on another in you because you did not see that it was your day of mercy
Luk  And he went into the Temple and put out those who were trading there
Luk  Saying to them It has been said My house is to be a house of prayer but you have made it a hole of thieves
Luk  And every day he was teaching in the Temple But the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people were attempting to put him to death
Luk  But they were not able to do anything because the people all kept near him being greatly interested in his words
Luk  And it came about on one of those days when he was teaching the people in the Temple and preaching the good news
Luk  That the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people came to him and said Make clear to us by what authority you do these things and who gave you this authority
Luk  And in answer he said to them I will put a question to you and do you give me an answer
Luk  The baptism of John was it from heaven or of men
Luk  And they said among themselves If we say From heaven he will say Why did you not have faith in him
Luk  But if we say Of men we will be stoned by the people for they are certain that John was a prophet
Luk  And they made answer that they had no idea where it came from
Luk  And Jesus said And I will not make clear to you by what authority I do these things
Luk  And he gave the people this story A man made a vinegarden and gave the use of it to some fieldworkers and went into another country for a long time
Luk  And at the right time he sent a servant to the workers to get part of the fruit from the vines but the workmen gave him blows and sent him away with nothing
Luk  And he sent another servant and they gave blows to him in the same way and put shame on him and sent him away with nothing
Luk  And he sent a third and they gave him wounds and put him out
Luk  And the lord of the garden said What am I to do I will send my dearly loved son they may give respect to him
Luk  But when the workmen saw him they said to one another This is he who will one day be the owner of the property let us put him to death and the heritage will be ours
Luk  And driving him out of the garden they put him to death Now what will the lord do to these workmen
Luk  He will come and put them to destruction and give the garden to others And when he said this they said May it not be so
Luk  But he looking on them said Is it not in the Writings The stone which the builders put on one side the same has become the chief stone of the building
Luk  Everyone falling on that stone will be broken but the man on whom the stone comes down will be crushed to dust
Luk  And the chief priests and the scribes made attempts to get their hands on him in that very hour and they were in fear of the people for they saw that he had made up this story against them
Luk  And they kept watch on him and sent out secret representatives who were acting the part of good men in order that they might get something from his words on account of which they might give him up to the government and into the power of the ruler
Luk  And they put a question to him saying Master we are certain that your teaching and your words are right and that you have no respect for a mans position but you are teaching the true way of God
Luk  Is it right for us to make payment of taxes to Caesar or not
Luk  But he saw through their trick and said to them
Luk  Let me see a penny Whose image and name are on it And they said Caesars
Luk  And he said Then give to Caesar the things which are Caesars and to God the things which are Gods
Luk  And they were not able to get anything from these words before the people but they were full of wonder at his answer and said nothing
Luk  And some of the Sadducees came to him who say that there is no coming back from the dead and they said to him
Luk  Master Moses said that if a mans brother comes to his end having a wife but no children his brother is to take the wife and get a family for his brother
Luk  Now there were seven brothers and the first had a wife and came to his end having no children
Luk  And the second
Luk  And the third took her and in the same way all the seven without having any children came to their end
Luk  And last of all the woman came to her end
Luk  When they come back from the dead whose wife will she be for all the seven had her
Luk  And Jesus said to them The sons of this world are married and have wives
Luk  But those to whom is given the reward of the world to come and to come back from the dead have no wives and are not married
Luk  And death has no more power over them for they are equal to the angels and are sons of God being of those who will come back from the dead
Luk  But even Moses made it clear that the dead come back to life saying in the story of the burning thorntree The Lord the God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob
Luk  Now he is not the God of the dead but of the living for all men are living to him
Luk  And some of the scribes in answer to this said Master you have said well
Luk  And they had fear of putting any more questions to him
Luk  And he said to them Why do they say that the Christ is the son of David
Luk  For David himself says in the book of Psalms The Lord said to my Lord Take your seat at my right hand
Luk  Till I put under your feet all those who are against you
Luk  David then gives him the name of Lord so how is it possible for him to be his son
Luk  And in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples
Luk  Keep away from the scribes whose pleasure it is to go about in long robes and to have words of respect said to them in the marketplaces and to take the chief seats in the Synagogues and the first places at feasts
Luk  Who take the property of widows and before the eyes of men make long prayers they will get a greater punishment
Luk  And looking up he saw the men of wealth putting their offerings in the moneybox
Luk  And he saw a certain poor widow putting in a farthing
Luk  And he said Truly I say to you This poor widow has given more than all of them
Luk  For they gave out of their wealth having more than enough for themselves but she even out of her need has put in all her living
Luk  And some were talking about the Temple how it was made fair with beautiful stones and with offerings but he said
Luk  As for these things which you see the days will come when not one stone will be resting on another but all will be broken down
Luk  And they said to him Master when will these things be and what sign will there be when these events are to take place
Luk  And he said Take care that you are not tricked for a number of people will come in my name saying I am he and The time is near do not go after them
Luk  And when news of wars and troubled times comes to your ears have no fear for these things have to be but the end will not be now
Luk  Then he said to them Nation will be moved against nation and kingdom against kingdom
Luk  There will be great earthshocks and outbursts of disease in a number of places and men will be without food and there will be wonders and great signs from heaven
Luk  But before all this they will take you and be very cruel to you giving you up to the Synagogues and to prisons taking you before kings and rulers because of my name
Luk  And it will be turned to a witness for you
Luk  So take care not to be troubled before the time comes about what answers you will give
Luk  For I will give you words and wisdom so that not one of those who are against you will be able to get the better of you or to put you in the wrong
Luk  But you will be given up even by your fathers and mothers your brothers and relations and friends and some of you will be put to death
Luk  And you will be hated by all men because of me
Luk  But not a hair of your head will come to destruction
Luk  By going through all these things you will keep your lives
Luk  But when you see armies all round about Jerusalem then be certain that her destruction is near
Luk  Then let those who are in Judaea go in flight to the mountains and those who are in the middle of the town go out and let not those who are in the country come in
Luk  For these are the days of punishment in which all the things in the Writings will be put into effect
Luk  It will be hard for women who are with child and for her with a baby at the breast in those days For great trouble will come on the land and wrath on this people
Luk  And they will be put to death with the sword and will be taken as prisoners into all the nations and Jerusalem will be crushed under the feet of the Gentiles till the times of the Gentiles are complete
Luk  And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars and on the earth fear among the nations and doubt because of the loud noise of the sea and the waves
Luk  Mens strength will go from them in fear and in waiting for the things which are coming on the earth for the powers of the heavens will be moved
Luk  And then they will see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory
Luk  But when these things come about let your heads be lifted up because your salvation is near
Luk  And he made a story for them See the figtree and all the trees
Luk  When they put out their young leaves you take note of it and it is clear to you that summer is coming
Luk  In the same way when you see these things taking place you may be certain that the kingdom of God is near
Luk  Truly I say to you This generation will not come to an end till all things are complete
Luk  Heaven and earth will come to an end but my words will not come to an end
Luk  But give attention to yourselves for fear that your hearts become overfull of the pleasures of food and wine and the cares of this life and that day may come on you suddenly and take you as in a net
Luk  For so it will come on all those who are living on the face of all the earth
Luk  But keep watch at all times with prayer that you may be strong enough to come through all these things and take your place before the Son of man
Luk  And every day he was teaching in the Temple and every night he went out to the mountain which is named the Mountain of Olives to take his rest
Luk  And all the people came early in the morning to give ear to his words in the Temple
Luk  Now the feast of unleavened bread was near which is called the Passover
Luk  And the chief priests and the scribes were looking for a chance to put him to death but they went in fear of the people
Luk  And Satan came into Judas Iscariot who was one of the twelve
Luk  And he went away and had a discussion with the chief priests and the rulers about how he might give him up to them
Luk  And they were glad and undertook to give him money
Luk  And he made an agreement with them to give him up to them if he got a chance when the people were not present
Luk  And the day of unleavened bread came when the Passover lamb is put to death
Luk  And Jesus sent Peter and John saying Go and make the Passover ready for us so that we may take it
Luk  And they said to him Where are we to get it ready
Luk  And he said to them When you go into the town you will see a man coming to you with a vessel of water go after him into the house into which he goes
Luk  And say to the master of the house The Master says Where is the guestroom where I may take the Passover with my disciples
Luk  And he will take you up to a great room with a table and seats there make ready
Luk  And they went and it was as he had said and they made the Passover ready
Luk  And when the time had come he took his seat and the Apostles with him
Luk  And he said I have had a great desire to keep this Passover with you before I come to my death
Luk  For I say to you I will not take it till it is made complete in the kingdom of God
Luk  And he took a cup and having given praise he said Make division of this among yourselves
Luk  For I say to you I will not take of the fruit of the vine till the kingdom of God has come
Luk  And he took bread and having given praise he gave it to them when it had been broken saying This is my body which is given for you do this in memory of me
Luk  And in the same way after the meal he took the cup saying This cup is the new testament made with my blood which is given for you
Luk  But the hand of him who is false to me is with me at the table
Luk  For it will be done to the Son of man after the purpose of God but unhappy is that man by whom he is given up
Luk  And they were wondering among themselves which of them it was who would do this thing
Luk  And there was an argument among them about which of them was the greatest
Luk  And he said The kings of the Gentiles are lords over them and those who have authority are given names of honour
Luk  But let it not be so with you but he who is greater let him become like the younger and he who is chief like a servant
Luk  For which is greater the guest who is seated at a meal or the servant who is waiting on him is it not the guest but I am among you as a servant
Luk  But you are those who have kept with me through my troubles
Luk  And I will give you a kingdom as my Father has given one to me
Luk  So that you may take food and drink at my table in my kingdom and be seated like kings judging the twelve tribes of Israel
Luk  Simon Simon Satan has made a request to have you so that he may put you to the test as grain is tested
Luk  But I have made prayer for you that your faith may not go from you and when you are turned again make your brothers strong
Luk  And he said to him Lord I am ready to go with you to prison and to death
Luk  And he said I say to you Peter before the cocks second cry today you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me
Luk  And he said to them When I sent you out without money or bag or shoes were you in need of anything And they said Nothing
Luk  And he said to them But now he who has a moneybag or a bag for food let him take it and he who has not let him give his coat for money and get a sword
Luk  For I say to you that these words will be put into effect in me And he was numbered among the evildoers for what has been said in the Writings about me has an end
Luk  And they said Lord here are two swords And he said It is enough
Luk  And he came out and went as his way was to the Mountain of Olives and the disciples went with him
Luk  And when he came to the place he said to them Make a prayer that you may not be put to the test
Luk  And he went a little distance away from them and falling on his knees in prayer he said
Luk  Father if it is your pleasure take this cup from me but still let your pleasure not mine be done
Luk  And an angel from heaven came to him to give him strength
Luk  And being in great trouble of soul the force of his prayer became stronger and great drops like blood came from him falling to the earth
Luk  And getting up from prayer he came to the disciples and saw that they were sleeping for sorrow
Luk  And he said Why are you sleeping Get up and give yourselves to prayer so that you may not be put to the test
Luk  And while he was saying these words there came a band of people and Judas one of the twelve was in front of them and he came near to Jesus to give him a kiss
Luk  But Jesus said to him Judas will you be false to the Son of man with a kiss
Luk  And when those who were with him saw what was coming they said Lord may we not make use of our swords
Luk  And one of them gave a blow to the servant of the high priest cutting off his right ear
Luk  But Jesus answering said Put up with this at least And touching his ear he made it well
Luk  And Jesus said to the chief priests and the captains of the Temple and the rulers who had come against him Have you come out as against a thief with swords and sticks
Luk  When I was in the Temple with you every day your hands were not stretched out against me but this is your hour and the authority of the dark power
Luk  And they made him a prisoner and took him away to the house of the high priest But Peter went after them at a distance
Luk  And a fire was lighted in the middle of the open square and they were seated together and Peter was among them
Luk  And a certain womanservant seeing him in the light of the fire and looking at him with attention said This man was with him
Luk  But he said Woman it is not true I have no knowledge of him
Luk  And after a little time another saw him and said You are one of them and he said Man I am not
Luk  And after about an hour another man said with decision Certainly this man was with him for he is a Galilaean
Luk  And Peter said Man I have no knowledge of these things of which you are talking And straight away while he was saying these words there came the cry of a cock
Luk  And the Lord turning gave Peter a look And the words of the Lord came to Peters mind how he had said This night before the hour of the cocks cry you will be false to me three times
Luk  And he went out weeping bitterly
Luk  And the men in whose hands Jesus was made sport of him and gave him blows
Luk  And covering his eyes they said to him Are you prophet enough to say who gave you that blow
Luk  And they said a number of other evil things against him
Luk  And when it was day the rulers of the people came together with the chief priests and the scribes and they took him before their Sanhedrin saying
Luk  If you are the Christ say so But he said If I say so you will not have belief
Luk  And if I put a question to you you will not give an answer
Luk  But in the future the Son of man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God
Luk  And they all said Are you then the Son of God and he said You say that I am
Luk  And they said What more need have we of witness we have the very words of his mouth
Luk  And they all went and took him before Pilate
Luk  And they made statements against him saying This man has to our knowledge been teaching our nation to do wrong and not to make payment of taxes to Caesar even saying that he himself is Christ a king
Luk  And Pilate said to him Are you the King of the Jews And he said in answer You say so
Luk  And Pilate said to the chief priests and the people In my opinion this man has done no wrong
Luk  But they became more violent than before saying He has made trouble among the people teaching through all Judaea from Galilee to this place
Luk  But at these words Pilate said Is the man a Galilaean
Luk  And when he saw that he was under the authority of Herod he sent him to Herod who was in Jerusalem himself at that time
Luk  Now when Herod saw Jesus he was very glad having for a long time had a desire to see him for he had had accounts of him and was hoping to see some wonders done by him
Luk  And he put a great number of questions to him but he said nothing
Luk  And the chief priests and the scribes were there making statements against him violently
Luk  And Herod with the men of his army put shame on him and made sport of him and dressing him in shining robes he sent him back to Pilate
Luk  And that day Herod and Pilate became friends with one another for before they had been against one another
Luk  And Pilate sent for the chief priests and the rulers and the people and said to them
Luk  You say that this man has been teaching the people evil things now I after going into the question before you see nothing wrong in this man in connection with the things which you have said against him
Luk  And Herod is of the same opinion for he has sent him back to us for you see he has done nothing for which I might put him to death
Luk  And so I will give him punishment and let him go
Luk  
Luk  But with loud voices they said all together Put this man to death and make Barabbas free
Luk  Now this man was in prison because of an attack against the government in the town in which there had been loss of life
Luk  And Pilate again said to them that it was his desire to let Jesus go free
Luk  But crying out they said To the cross with him
Luk  And he said to them a third time Why what evil has he done I see no reason for putting him to death I will give him punishment and let him go
Luk  But they went on crying out loudly Let him be put to death on the cross And they had their way
Luk  And Pilate gave his decision for their desire to be put into effect
Luk  And in answer to their request he let that man go free who had been in prison for acting against the government and causing death and Jesus he gave up to their pleasure
Luk  And while they were taking him away they put their hands on Simon of Cyrene who was coming from the country and made him take the cross after Jesus
Luk  And a great band of people went after him and of women making signs of grief and weeping for him
Luk  But Jesus turning to them said Daughters of Jerusalem let not your weeping be for me but for yourselves and for your children
Luk  For the days are coming in which they will say Happy are those who have had no children whose bodies have never given birth whose breasts have never given milk
Luk  And they will say to the mountains Come down on us and to the hills Be a cover over us
Luk  For if they do these things when the tree is green what will they do when it is dry
Luk  And two others evildoers were taken with him to be put to death
Luk  And when they came to the place which is named Golgotha they put him on the cross and the evildoers one on the right side and the other on the left
Luk  And Jesus said Father let them have forgiveness for they have no knowledge of what they are doing And they made division of his clothing among them by the decision of chance
Luk  And the people were looking on And the rulers made sport of him saying He was a saviour of others let him do something for himself if he is the Christ the man of Gods selection
Luk  And the men of the army made sport of him coming to him and giving him bitter wine
Luk  And saying If you are the King of the Jews get yourself free
Luk  And these words were put in writing over him THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS
Luk  And one of the evildoers on the cross with bitter feeling said to him Are you not the Christ Get yourself and us out of this
Luk  But the other protesting said Have you no fear of God for you have a part in the same punishment
Luk  And with reason for we have the right reward of our acts but this man has done nothing wrong
Luk  And he said Jesus keep me in mind when you come in your kingdom
Luk  And he said to him Truly I say to you Today you will be with me in Paradise
Luk  And it was now about the sixth hour and all the land was dark till the ninth hour
Luk  The light of the sun went out and the curtain in the Temple was parted in two
Luk  And Jesus gave a loud cry and said Father into your hands I give my spirit and when he had said this he gave up his spirit
Luk  And when the captain saw what was done he gave praise to God saying Without doubt this was an upright man
Luk  And all the people who had come together to see it when they saw the things which were done went back again making signs of grief
Luk  And all his friends and the women who came with him from Galilee were waiting at a distance watching these things
Luk  Now there was a man named Joseph a man of authority and a good and upright man
Luk  He had not given his approval to their decision or their acts of Arimathaea a town of the Jews who was waiting for the kingdom of God
Luk  This man went to Pilate and made a request for the body of Jesus
Luk  And he took it down and folding it in a linen cloth he put it in a place cut in the rock for a dead body and no one had ever been put in it
Luk  Now it was the day of making ready and the Sabbath was coming on
Luk  And the women who had come with him from Galilee went after him and saw the place and how his body had been put to rest
Luk  And they went back and got ready spices and perfumes and on the Sabbath they took their rest in agreement with the law
Luk  But on the first day of the week at dawn they came to the place where his body had been put taking the spices which they had got ready
Luk  And they saw that the stone had been rolled away
Luk  And they went in but the body of the Lord Jesus was not there
Luk  And while they were in doubt about it they saw two men in shining clothing by them
Luk  And while their faces were bent down to the earth in fear these said to them Why are you looking for the living among the dead
Luk  He is not here he has come back to life have in mind what he said to you when he was still in Galilee saying
Luk  The Son of man will be given up into the hands of evildoers and be put to death on the cross and on the third day he will come back to life
Luk  And his words came back into their minds
Luk  And they went away from that place and gave an account of all these things to the eleven disciples and all the others
Luk  Now they were Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them said these things to the Apostles
Luk  But these words seemed foolish to them and they had no belief in them
Luk  But Peter got up and went to the place where the body had been put and looking in he saw nothing but the linen cloths and he went to his house full of wonder at what had taken place
Luk  And then two of them on that very day were going to a little town named Emmaus which was about seven miles from Jerusalem
Luk  And they were talking together about all those things which had taken place
Luk  And while they were talking and questioning together Jesus himself came near and went with them
Luk  But their eyes were not open that they might have knowledge of him
Luk  And he said to them What are you talking about together while you go
Luk  Then stopping and looking sadly at him one of them named Cleopas said to him Are you the only man living in Jerusalem who has not had news of the things which have taken place there at this time
Luk  And he said to them What things And they said The things to do with Jesus of Nazareth who was a prophet great in his acts and his words before God and all the people
Luk  And how the chief priests and our rulers gave him up to be put to death on the cross
Luk  But we were hoping that he would be the Saviour of Israel In addition to all this he has now let three days go by from the time when these things took place
Luk  And certain women among us gave us cause for wonder for they went early to the place where his body had been put
Luk  And it was not there then they came saying that they had seen a vision of angels who said that he was living
Luk  And some of those who were with us went to the place and saw that it was as the women had said but him they did not see
Luk  And he said O foolish men how slow you are to give belief to what the prophets have said
Luk  Was it not necessary for the Christ to go through these things and to come into his glory
Luk  And he made clear to them all the things in the Writings from Moses and from all the prophets which had to do with himself
Luk  And they came near the town to which they were going and he seemed as if he was going on
Luk  But they kept him back saying Do not go for evening is near the day is almost gone And he went in with them
Luk  And when he was seated with them at table he took the bread and said words of blessing and making division of it he gave it to them
Luk  And then their eyes were open and they had knowledge of him but he went from their view
Luk  And they said to one another Were not our hearts burning in us while he was talking to us on the way making clear to us the holy Writings
Luk  And that very hour they got up and went back to Jerusalem where the eleven and the others had come together
Luk  And they said to them The Lord has truly come back to life again and Simon has seen him
Luk  And they gave an account of the things which had taken place on the way and how when he gave them bread they had knowledge of him
Luk  And while they were saying these things he himself was among them and said to them Peace be with you
Luk  But they were full of fear being of the opinion that they were seeing a spirit
Luk  And he said to them Why are you troubled and why are your hearts full of doubt
Luk  See my hands and my feet it is I myself put your hands on me and make certain for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see that I have
Luk  And when he had said this he let them see his hands and his feet
Luk  And because for joy and wonder they were still in doubt he said to them Have you any food here
Luk  And they gave him a bit of cooked fish
Luk  And before their eyes he took a meal
Luk  And he said to them These are the words which I said to you when I was still with you how it was necessary for all the things which are in the writings of Moses and the prophets and in the Psalms about me to be put into effect
Luk  Then he made the holy Writings clear to their minds
Luk  And he said to them So it is in the Writings that the Christ would undergo death and come back to life again on the third day
Luk  And that teaching about a change of heart and forgiveness of sins is to be given to Jerusalem first and to all nations in his name
Luk  You are witnesses of these things
Luk  And now I will send to you what my father has undertaken to give you but do not go from the town till the power from heaven comes to you
Luk  And he took them out till they were near Bethany and lifting up his hands he gave them a blessing
Luk  And while he was doing so he went from them and was taken up into heaven
Luk  And they gave him worship and went back to Jerusalem with great joy
Luk  And they were in the Temple at all times giving praise to God
Jhn  From the first he was the Word and the Word was in relation with God and was God
Jhn  This Word was from the first in relation with God
Jhn  All things came into existence through him and without him nothing was
Jhn  What came into existence in him was life and the life was the light of men
Jhn  And the light goes on shining in the dark it is not overcome by the dark
Jhn  There was a man sent from God whose name was John
Jhn  He came for witness to give witness about the light so that all men might have faith through him
Jhn  He himself was not the light he was sent to give witness about the light
Jhn  The true light which gives light to every man was then coming into the world
Jhn  He was in the world the world which came into being through him but the world had no knowledge of him
Jhn  He came to the things which were his and his people did not take him to their hearts
Jhn  To all those who did so take him however he gave the right of becoming children of Godthat is to those who had faith in his name
Jhn  Whose birth was from God and not from blood or from an impulse of the flesh and mans desire
Jhn  And so the Word became flesh and took a place among us for a time and we saw his glorysuch glory as is given to an only son by his fathersaw it to be true and full of grace
Jhn  John gave witness about him crying This is he of whom I said He who is coming after me is put over me because he was in existence before me
Jhn  From his full measure we have all been given grace on grace
Jhn  For the law was given through Moses grace and the true way of life are ours through Jesus Christ
Jhn  No man has seen God at any time the only Son who is on the breast of the Father he has made clear what God is
Jhn  And this is the witness of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to him with the question Who are you
Jhn  He said quite openly and straightforwardly I am not the Christ
Jhn  And they said to him What then Are you Elijah And he said I am not Are you the prophet And his answer was I am not
Jhn  So they said to him Who are you then We have to give some answer to those who sent us What have you to say about yourself
Jhn  He said I am the voice of one crying in the waste land Make straight the way of the Lord as said Isaiah the prophet
Jhn  Those who had been sent came from the Pharisees
Jhn  And they put this question to him saying Why then are you giving baptism if you are not the Christ or Elijah or the prophet
Jhn  Johns answer was I give baptism with water but there is one among you of whom you have no knowledge
Jhn  It is he who is coming after me I am not good enough to undo his shoes
Jhn  These things took place at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan where John was giving baptism
Jhn  The day after John sees Jesus coming to him and says See here is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world
Jhn  This is he of whom I said One is coming after me who is put over me because he was in existence before me
Jhn  I myself had no knowledge of him but I came giving baptism with water so that he might be seen openly by Israel
Jhn  And John gave this witness saying I saw the Spirit coming down from heaven like a dove and resting on him
Jhn  I had no knowledge who he was but he who sent me to give baptism with water said to me The one on whom you see the Spirit coming down and resting it is he who gives baptism with the Holy Spirit
Jhn  This I saw myself and my witness is that he is the Son of God
Jhn  The day after John was there again with two of his disciples
Jhn  And looking at Jesus while he was walking he said See there is the Lamb of God
Jhn  Hearing what he said the two disciples went after Jesus
Jhn  And Jesus turning round saw them coming after him and said to them What are you looking for They said to him Rabbi which is to say Master where are you living
Jhn  He said to them Come and see They went with him then and saw where he was living and they were with him all that day it was then about the tenth hour of the day
Jhn  Andrew Simon Peters brother was one of the two men who hearing what John said went after Jesus
Jhn  Early in the morning he came across his brother and said to him We have made discovery It is the Messiah which is to say the Christ
Jhn  And he took him to Jesus Looking at him fixedly Jesus said You are Simon the son of John your name will be Cephas which is to say Peter
Jhn  The day after this Jesus had a desire to go into Galilee He came across Philip and said to him Come and be my disciple
Jhn  Now Philips town was Bethsaida where Andrew and Peter came from
Jhn  Philip came across Nathanael and said to him We have made a discovery It is he of whom Moses in the law and the prophets were writing Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph
Jhn  Nazareth said Nathanael Is it possible for any good to come out of Nazareth Philip said to him Come and see
Jhn  Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him and said of him See here is a true son of Israel in whom there is nothing false
Jhn  Nathanael said to him Where did you get knowledge of me In answer Jesus said Before Philip was talking with you while you were still under the figtree I saw you
Jhn  Nathanael said to him Rabbi you are the Son of God you are King of Israel
Jhn  In answer Jesus said to him You have faith because I said to you I saw you under the figtree You will see greater things than these
Jhn  And he said to him Truly I say to you all You will see heaven opening and Gods angels going up and coming down on the Son of man
Jhn  On the third day two people were going to be married at Cana in Galilee The mother of Jesus was there
Jhn  And Jesus with his disciples came as guests
Jhn  When they had not enough wine the mother of Jesus said to him They have no wine
Jhn  Jesus said to her Woman this is not your business my time is still to come
Jhn  His mother said to the servants Whatever he says to you do it
Jhn  Now six pots of stone every one taking two or three firkins of water were placed there for the purpose of washing as is the way of the Jews
Jhn  Jesus said to the servants Make the pots full of water And they made them full to the top
Jhn  Then he said to them Now take some and give it to the master of the feast So they took it to him
Jhn  After tasting the water which had now become wine the master of the feast having no idea where it came from though it was clear to the servants who took the water out sent for the newlymarried man
Jhn  And said to him Every man first puts out his best wine and when all have had enough he puts out what is not so good but you have kept the good wine till now
Jhn  This the first of his signs Jesus did at Cana in Galilee and let his glory be seen openly and his disciples put their faith in him
Jhn  After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother his brothers and his disciples and they were there not more than two or three days
Jhn  The time of the Passover of the Jews was near and Jesus went up to Jerusalem
Jhn  And there in the Temple he saw men trading in oxen and sheep and doves and he saw the changers of money in their seats
Jhn  And he made a whip of small cords and put them all out of the Temple with the sheep and the oxen sending in all directions the small money of the changers and overturning their tables
Jhn  And to those who were trading in doves he said Take these things away do not make my Fathers house a market
Jhn  And it came to the minds of the disciples that the Writings say I am on fire with passion for your house
Jhn  Then the Jews put this question to him What sign of authority have you to give us seeing that you do these things
Jhn  And Jesus said to them Send destruction on this Temple and I will put it up again in three days
Jhn  The Jews said The building of this Temple took fortysix years and you will put it up in three days
Jhn  But his words were about that holy building which was his body
Jhn  So when he had come back again from the dead the memory of these words came back to the disciples and they had faith in the holy Writings and in the word which Jesus had said
Jhn  Now while he was in Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover a great number of people came to have faith in his name after seeing the signs which he did
Jhn  But Jesus did not have faith in them because he had knowledge of them all
Jhn  He had no need for any witness about man for he himself had knowledge of what was in man
Jhn  Now there was among the Pharisees a man named Nicodemus who was one of the rulers of the Jews
Jhn  He came to Jesus by night and said to him Rabbi we are certain that you have come from God as a teacher because no man would be able to do these signs which you do if God was not with him
Jhn  Jesus said to him Truly I say to you Without a new birth no man is able to see the kingdom of God
Jhn  Nicodemus said to him How is it possible for a man to be given birth when he is old Is he able to go into his mothers body a second time and come to birth again
Jhn  Jesus said in answer Truly I say to you If a mans birth is not from water and from the Spirit it is not possible for him to go into the kingdom of God
Jhn  That which has birth from the flesh is flesh and that which has birth from the Spirit is spirit
Jhn  Do not be surprised that I say to you It is necessary for you to have a second birth
Jhn  The wind goes where its pleasure takes it and the sound of it comes to your ears but you are unable to say where it comes from and where it goes so it is with everyone whose birth is from the Spirit
Jhn  And Nicodemus said to him How is it possible for these things to be
Jhn  And Jesus answering said Are you the teacher of Israel and have no knowledge of these things
Jhn  Truly I say to you We say that of which we have knowledge we give witness of what we have seen and you do not take our witness to be true
Jhn  If you have no belief when my words are about the things of earth how will you have belief if my words are about the things of heaven
Jhn  And no one has ever gone up to heaven but he who came down from heaven the Son of man
Jhn  As the snake was lifted up by Moses in the waste land even so it is necessary for the Son of man to be lifted up
Jhn  So that whoever has faith may have in him eternal life
Jhn  For God had such love for the world that he gave his only Son so that whoever has faith in him may not come to destruction but have eternal life
Jhn  God did not send his Son into the world to be judge of the world he sent him so that the world might have salvation through him
Jhn  The man who has faith in him does not come up to be judged but he who has no faith in him has been judged even now because he has no faith in the name of the only Son of God
Jhn  And this is the test by which men are judged the light has come into the world and men have more love for the dark than for the light because their acts are evil
Jhn  The light is hated by everyone whose acts are evil and he does not come to the light for fear that his acts will be seen
Jhn  But he whose life is true comes to the light so that it may be clearly seen that his acts have been done by the help of God
Jhn  After these things Jesus and his disciples went into the land of Judaea and there he was with them for some time giving baptism
Jhn  Now John was then giving baptism at Aenon near Salim because there was much water there and people came and were given baptism
Jhn  For at this time John had not been put into prison
Jhn  Then a question came up between Johns disciples and a Jew about washing
Jhn  And they went to John and said to him Rabbi the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan the man to whom you gave witness is now giving baptism and everyone is going to him
Jhn  And this was Johns answer A man is unable to have anything if it is not given to him from heaven
Jhn  You yourselves give witness that I said I am not the Christ What I said was I am sent before the Christ
Jhn  He who has the bride is the husband but the husbands friend whose place is by his side and whose ears are open to him is full of joy because of the husbands voice such is my joy and it is complete
Jhn  He has to become greater while I become less
Jhn  He who comes from heaven is greater than all others he who comes from earth is of the earth and of the earth are his words he who comes from heaven is over all
Jhn  He gives witness of what he has seen and of what has come to his ears and no man takes his witness as true
Jhn  He who so takes his witness has made clear his faith that God is true
Jhn  For he whom God has sent says Gods words and God does not give him the Spirit by measure
Jhn  The Father has love for the Son and has put all things into his hands
Jhn  He who has faith in the Son has eternal life but he who has not faith in the Son will not see life Gods wrath is resting on him
Jhn  Now when it was clear to the Lord that word had come to the ears of the Pharisees that Jesus was making more disciples than John and was giving them baptism
Jhn  Though in fact it was his disciples who gave baptism not Jesus himself
Jhn  He went out of Judaea into Galilee again
Jhn  And it was necessary for him to go through Samaria
Jhn  So he came to a town of Samaria which was named Sychar near to the bit of land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph
Jhn  Now Jacobs fountain was there Jesus being tired after his journey was resting by the fountain It was about the sixth hour
Jhn  A woman of Samaria came to get water and Jesus said to her Give me some water
Jhn  For his disciples had gone to the town to get food
Jhn  The woman of Samaria said to him Why do you a Jew make a request for water to me a woman of Samaria She said this because Jews have nothing to do with the people of Samaria
Jhn  In answer Jesus said If you had knowledge of what God gives freely and who it is who says to you Give me water you would make your prayer to him and he would give you living water
Jhn  The woman said to him Sir you have no vessel and the fountain is deep from where will you get the living water
Jhn  Are you greater than our father Jacob who gave us the fountain and took the water of it himself with his children and his cattle
Jhn  Jesus said to her Everyone who takes this water will be in need of it again
Jhn  But whoever takes the water I give him will never be in need of drink again for the water I give him will become in him a fountain of eternal life
Jhn  The woman said to him Sir give me this water so that I may not be in need again of drink and will not have to come all this way for it
Jhn  Jesus said to her Go get your husband and come back here with him
Jhn  In answer the woman said I have no husband Jesus said to her You have said rightly I have no husband
Jhn  You have had five husbands and the man you have now is not your husband that was truly said
Jhn  The woman said to him Sir I see that you are a prophet
Jhn  Our fathers gave worship on this mountain but you Jews say that the right place for worship is in Jerusalem
Jhn  Jesus said to her Woman take my word for this the time is coming when you will not give worship to the Father on this mountain or in Jerusalem
Jhn  You give worship but without knowledge of what you are worshipping we give worship to what we have knowledge of for salvation comes from the Jews
Jhn  But the time is coming and is even now here when the true worshippers will give worship to the Father in the true way of the spirit for these are the worshippers desired by the Father
Jhn  God is Spirit then let his worshippers give him worship in the true way of the spirit
Jhn  The woman said to him I am certain that the Messiah who is named Christ is coming when he comes he will make all things clear to us
Jhn  Jesus said to her I who am talking to you am he
Jhn  At that point the disciples came back and they were surprised to see him talking to a woman but not one of them said to him What is your purpose or Why are you talking to her
Jhn  Then the woman put down her waterpot and went into the town and said to the people
Jhn  Come and see a man who has been talking to me of everything I ever did Is it possible that this is the Christ
Jhn  So they went out of the town and came to him
Jhn  While this was taking place the disciples were saying to Jesus Master take some food
Jhn  But he said to them I have food of which you have no knowledge
Jhn  So the disciples said one to another Did anyone give him food
Jhn  Jesus said My food is to do the pleasure of him who sent me and to make his work complete
Jhn  You would say Four months from now is the time of the graincutting Take a look I say to you at the fields they are even now white for cutting
Jhn  He who does the cutting now has his reward he is getting together fruit for eternal life so that he who did the planting and he who gets in the grain may have joy together
Jhn  In this the saying is a true one One does the planting and another gets in the grain
Jhn  I sent you to get in grain which you had no hand in planting other men did that work and you take the reward
Jhn  Now a number of the people of that town had faith in him because of the womans witness He has been talking to me of everything I ever did
Jhn  So when the people came to him they made request to him to be among them for a time and he was there two days
Jhn  And a great number more of them came to have faith in him because of what he himself said
Jhn  And they said to the woman Now we have faith but not because of your story we ourselves have given ear to his words and we are certain that he is truly the Saviour of the world
Jhn  And after the two days he went on from there into Galilee
Jhn  For Jesus himself said that a prophet has no honour in the country of his birth
Jhn  So when he came into Galilee the Galilaeans took him to their hearts because of the things which they had seen him do in Jerusalem at the feastthey themselves having been there at the feast
Jhn  So he came to Cana in Galilee where he had made the water wine And there was a certain man of high position whose son was ill at Capernaum
Jhn  When it came to his ears that Jesus had come from Judaea into Galilee he went to him and made a request that he would come down to his son who was near to death and make him well
Jhn  Then Jesus said to him You will not have faith if you do not see signs and wonders
Jhn  The man said Sir come down before my boy is dead
Jhn  And Jesus said Go in peace your son is living The man had faith in the word which Jesus said to him and went away
Jhn  And while he was going down his servants came to him and said Your boy is living
Jhn  So he put a question to them as to the hour when he became better and they said to him The disease went from him yesterday at the seventh hour
Jhn  It was clear then to the father that this was the very time at which Jesus said to him Your son is living And he had faith in Jesus he and all his family
Jhn  Now this is the second sign which Jesus did after he had come out of Judaea into Galilee
Jhn  After these things there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem
Jhn  Now in Jerusalem near the sheepmarket there is a public bath which in Hebrew is named Bethzatha It has five doorways
Jhn  In these doorways there were a great number of people with different diseases some unable to see some without the power of walking some with wasted bodies
Jhn  
Jhn  One man was there who had been ill for thirtyeight years
Jhn  When Jesus saw him there on the floor it was clear to him that he had been now a long time in that condition and so he said to the man Is it your desire to get well
Jhn  The ill man said in answer Sir I have nobody to put me into the bath when the water is moving and while I am on the way down some other person gets in before me
Jhn  Jesus said to him Get up take your bed and go
Jhn  And the man became well straight away and took up his bed and went Now that day was the Sabbath
Jhn  So the Jews said to the man who had been made well It is the Sabbath and it is against the law for you to take up your bed
Jhn  He said to them But he who made me well said to me Take up your bed and go
Jhn  Then they put to him the question Who is the man who said to you Take it up and go
Jhn  Now he who had been made well had no knowledge who it was Jesus having gone away because of the number of people who were in that place
Jhn  After a time Jesus came across him in the Temple and said to him See you are well and strong do no more sin for fear a worse thing comes to you
Jhn  The man went away and said to the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well
Jhn  And for this reason the Jews were turned against Jesus because he was doing these things on the Sabbath
Jhn  But his answer was My Father is still working even now and so I am working
Jhn  For this cause the Jews had an even greater desire to put Jesus to death because not only did he not keep the Sabbath but he said God was his Father so making himself equal with God
Jhn  So Jesus made answer and said Truly I say to you The Son is not able to do anything himself he is able to do only what he sees the Father doing whatever the Father does the Son does it in the same way
Jhn  For the Father has love for the Son and lets him see everything which he does and he will let him see greater works than these so that you may be full of wonder
Jhn  In the same way as the Father gives life to the dead even so the Son gives life to those to whom he is pleased to give it
Jhn  The Father is not the judge of men but he has given all decisions into the hands of the Son
Jhn  So that all men may give honour to the Son even as they give honour to the Father He who gives no honour to the Son gives no honour to the Father who sent him
Jhn  Truly I say to you The man whose ears are open to my word and who has faith in him who sent me has eternal life he will not be judged but has come from death into life
Jhn  Truly I say to you The time is coming it has even now come when the voice of the Son of God will come to the ears of the dead and those hearing it will have life
Jhn  For even as the Father has life in himself so he has given to the Son to have life in himself
Jhn  And he has given him authority to be judge because he is the Son of man
Jhn  Do not be surprised at this for the time is coming when his voice will come to all who are in the place of the dead
Jhn  And they will come out those who have done good into the new life and those who have done evil to be judged
Jhn  Of myself I am unable to do anything as the voice comes to me so I give a decision and my decision is right because I have no desire to do what is pleasing to myself but only what is pleasing to him who sent me
Jhn  If I gave witness about myself my witness would not be true
Jhn  There is another who gives witness about me and I am certain that the witness he gives about me is true
Jhn  You sent to John and he gave true witness
Jhn  But I have no need of a mans witness I only say these things so that you may have salvation
Jhn  He was a burning and shining light and for a time you were ready to be happy in his light
Jhn  But the witness which I have is greater than that of John the work which the Father has given me to do the very work which I am now doing is a witness that the Father has sent me
Jhn  And the Father himself who sent me has given witness about me Not one of you has ever given ear to his voice his form you have not seen
Jhn  And you have not kept his word in your hearts because you have not faith in him whom he has sent
Jhn  You make search in the holy Writings in the belief that through them you get eternal life and it is those Writings which give witness about me
Jhn  And still you have no desire to come to me so that you may have life
Jhn  I do not take honour from men
Jhn  But I have knowledge of you that you have no love for God in your hearts
Jhn  I have come in my Fathers name and your hearts are not open to me If another comes with no other authority but himself you will give him your approval
Jhn  How is it possible for you to have faith while you take honour one from another and have no desire for the honour which comes from the only God
Jhn  Put out of your minds the thought that I will say things against you to the Father the one who says things against you is Moses on whom you put your hopes
Jhn  If you had belief in Moses you would have belief in me for his writings are about me
Jhn  If you have no belief in his writings how will you have belief in my words
Jhn  After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galileethat is the sea of Tiberias
Jhn  And a great number of people went after him because they saw the signs which he did on those who were ill
Jhn  Then Jesus went up the mountain and was seated there with his disciples
Jhn  Now the Passover a feast of the Jews was near
Jhn  Lifting up his eyes Jesus saw a great number of people coming to where he was and he said to Philip Where may we get bread for all these people
Jhn  This he said testing him for he had no doubt what he himself would do
Jhn  Philip made answer Bread to the value of two hundred pence would not be enough even to give everyone a little
Jhn  One of his disciples Andrew the brother of Simon Peter said to Jesus
Jhn  There is a boy here with five barley cakes and two fishes but what is that among such a number
Jhn  Jesus said Let the people be seated Now there was much grass in that place And those seated on the grass were about five thousand
Jhn  Then Jesus took the cakes and having given praise to God he gave them to the people who were seated and the fishes in the same way as much as they had need of
Jhn  And when they had had enough Jesus said to his disciples Take up the broken bits which are over so that nothing may be wasted
Jhn  So they took them up twelve baskets full of broken bits of the five cakes which were over after the people had had enough
Jhn  And when the people saw the sign which he had done they said Truly this is the prophet who is to come into the world
Jhn  Now when Jesus saw that the people were about to come and take him by force to make him a king he went away again up the mountain by himself
Jhn  When evening came the disciples went down to the sea
Jhn  And they took a boat and went across the sea in the direction of Capernaum By then it was dark and still Jesus had not come to them
Jhn  The sea was getting rough because of a strong wind which was blowing
Jhn  After they had gone three or four miles they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near to the boat and they had great fear
Jhn  But he said to them It is I have no fear
Jhn  Then they readily took him into the boat and straight away the boat was at the land to which they were going
Jhn  The day after the people who were on the other side of the sea saw that only one small boat had been there that Jesus had not gone in that boat with the disciples but that the disciples had gone away by themselves
Jhn  Some other boats however came from Tiberias near to the place where they had taken the bread after the Lord had given praise
Jhn  So when the people saw that Jesus was not there or his disciples they got into those boats and went over to Capernaum looking for Jesus
Jhn  And when they came across him on the other side of the sea they said Rabbi when did you come here
Jhn  Jesus answering them said Truly I say to you You come after me not because you saw signs but because you were given the bread and had enough
Jhn  Let your work not be for the food which comes to an end but for the food which goes on for eternal life which the Son of man will give to you for on him has God the Father put his mark
Jhn  Then they said to him How may we do the works of God
Jhn  Jesus answering said to them This is to do the work of God to have faith in him whom God has sent
Jhn  So they said What sign do you give us so that we may see and have faith in you What do you do
Jhn  Our fathers had the manna in the waste land as the Writings say He gave them bread from heaven
Jhn  Jesus then said to them Truly I say to you What Moses gave you was not the bread from heaven it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven
Jhn  The bread of God is the bread which comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world
Jhn  Ah Lord they said give us that bread for ever
Jhn  And this was the answer of Jesus I am the bread of life He who comes to me will never be in need of food and he who has faith in me will never be in need of drink
Jhn  But it is as I said to you you have seen me and still you have no faith
Jhn  Whatever the Father gives to me will come to me and I will not send away anyone who comes to me
Jhn  For I have come down from heaven not to do my pleasure but the pleasure of him who sent me
Jhn  And this is the pleasure of him who sent me that I am not to let out of my hands anything which he has given me but I am to give it new life on the last day
Jhn  This I say is my Fathers pleasure that everyone who sees the Son and has faith in him may have eternal life and I will take him up on the last day
Jhn  Now the Jews said bitter things about Jesus because of his words I am the bread which came down from heaven
Jhn  And they said Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we have seen How is it then that he now says I have come down from heaven
Jhn  Jesus made answer and said Do not say things against me one to another
Jhn  No man is able to come to me if the Father who sent me does not give him the desire to come and I will take him up from the dead on the last day
Jhn  The writings of the prophets say And they will all have teaching from God Everyone whose ears have been open to the teaching of the Father comes to me
Jhn  Not that anyone has ever seen the Father only he who is from God he has seen the Father
Jhn  Truly I say to you He who has faith in me has eternal life
Jhn  I am the bread of life
Jhn  Your fathers took the manna in the waste landand they are dead
Jhn  The bread which comes from heaven is such bread that a man may take it for food and never see death
Jhn  I am the living bread which has come from heaven if any man takes this bread for food he will have life for ever and more than this the bread which I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world
Jhn  Then the Jews had an angry discussion among themselves saying How is it possible for this man to give us his flesh for food
Jhn  Then Jesus said to them Truly I say to you If you do not take the flesh of the Son of man for food and if you do not take his blood for drink you have no life in you
Jhn  He who takes my flesh for food and my blood for drink has eternal life and I will take him up from the dead at the last day
Jhn  My flesh is true food and my blood is true drink
Jhn  He who takes my flesh for food and my blood for drink is in me and I in him
Jhn  As the living Father has sent me and I have life because of the Father even so he who takes me for his food will have life because of me
Jhn  This is the bread which has come down from heaven It is not like the food which your fathers had they took of the manna and are dead but he who takes this bread for food will have life for ever
Jhn  Jesus said these things in the Synagogue while he was teaching at Capernaum
Jhn  Then hearing this a number of his disciples said This is a hard saying who is able to take in such teaching
Jhn  When Jesus became conscious that his disciples were protesting about what he said he said to them Does this give you trouble
Jhn  What then will you say if you see the Son of man going up to where he was before
Jhn  The spirit is the life giver the flesh is of no value the words which I have said to you are spirit and they are life
Jhn  But still some of you have no faith For it was clear to Jesus from the first who they were who had no faith and who it was who would be false to him
Jhn  And he said This is why I said to you No man is able to come to me if he is not given the power to do so by the Father
Jhn  Because of what he said a number of the disciples went back and would no longer go with him
Jhn  So Jesus said to the twelve Have you a desire to go away
Jhn  Then Simon Peter gave this answer Lord to whom are we to go you have the words of eternal life
Jhn  And we have faith and are certain that you are the Holy One of God
Jhn  Then Jesus said Did I not make a selection of you the twelve and one of you is a son of the Evil One
Jhn  He was talking of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot It was he who was to be false to Jesusone of the twelve
Jhn  After this Jesus went from place to place in Galilee He did not go about in Judaea because the Jews were looking for a chance to put him to death
Jhn  But the feast of the Jews the feast of tents was near
Jhn  So his brothers said to him Go away from here into Judaea so that your disciples may see the works which you do
Jhn  Because no man does things secretly if he has a desire that men may have knowledge of him If you do these things let yourself be seen by all men
Jhn  For even his brothers had no belief in him
Jhn  Jesus said to them My time is still to come but any time is good for you
Jhn  It is not possible for you to be hated by the world but I am hated by it because I give witness that what it does is evil
Jhn  Go you up to the feast I am not going up now to the feast because my time has not fully come
Jhn  Having said these things to them he still kept in Galilee
Jhn  But after his brothers had gone up to the feast then he went up not publicly but in secret
Jhn  At the feast the Jews were looking for him and saying Where is he
Jhn  And there was much discussion about him among the mass of the people Some said He is a good man but others said No he is giving people false ideas
Jhn  But no man said anything about him openly for fear of the Jews
Jhn  Now in the middle of the feast Jesus went up to the Temple and was teaching
Jhn  Then the Jews were surprised and said How has this man got knowledge of books He has never been to school
Jhn  Jesus gave them this answer It is not my teaching but his who sent me
Jhn  If any man is ready to do Gods pleasure he will have knowledge of the teaching and of where it comes fromfrom God or from myself
Jhn  The man whose words come from himself is looking for glory for himself but he who is looking for the glory of him who sent himthat man is true and there is no evil in him
Jhn  Did not Moses give you the law Even so not one of you keeps the law Why have you a desire to put me to death
Jhn  The people said in answer You have an evil spirit who has any desire to put you to death
Jhn  This was the answer of Jesus I have done one work and you are all surprised at it
Jhn  Moses gave you circumcisionnot that it comes from Moses but from the fathersand even on the Sabbath you give a child circumcision
Jhn  If a child is given circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken why are you angry with me because I made a man completely well on the Sabbath
Jhn  Let not your decisions be based on what you see but on righteousness
Jhn  Then some of the people of Jerusalem said Is not this the man whose death is desired
Jhn  And here he is talking openly and they say nothing to him Is it possible that the rulers have knowledge that this is truly the Christ
Jhn  However it is clear to us where this man comes from but when the Christ comes no one will have knowledge where he comes from
Jhn  Then when he was teaching in the Temple Jesus said with a loud voice You have knowledge of me and you have knowledge of where I come from and I have not come of myself but there is One who has sent me he is true but you have no knowledge of him
Jhn  I have knowledge of him because I came from him and he sent me
Jhn  Then they had a desire to take him but no man put hands on him because his hour was still to come
Jhn  And numbers of the people had belief in him and they said When the Christ comes will he do more signs than this man has done
Jhn  This discussion of the people came to the ears of the Pharisees and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent servants to take him
Jhn  Then Jesus said I will be with you a little longer and then I go to him who sent me
Jhn  You will be looking for me and you will not see me and where I am you may not come
Jhn  So the Jews said among themselves To what place is he going where we will not see him will he go to the Jews living among the Greeks and become the teacher of the Greeks
Jhn  What is this saying of his You will be looking for me and will not see me and where I am you may not come
Jhn  On the last day the great day of the feast Jesus got up and said in a loud voice If any man is in need of drink let him come to me and I will give it to him
Jhn  He who has faith in me out of his body as the Writings have said will come rivers of living water
Jhn  This he said of the Spirit which would be given to those who had faith in him the Spirit had not been given then because the glory of Jesus was still to come
Jhn  When these words came to their ears some of the people said This is certainly the prophet
Jhn  Others said This is the Christ But others said Not so will the Christ come from Galilee
Jhn  Do not the Writings say that the Christ comes of the seed of David and from Bethlehem the little town where David was
Jhn  So there was a division among the people because of him
Jhn  And some of them had a desire to take him but no man put hands on him
Jhn  Then the servants went back to the chief priests and Pharisees who said to them Why have you not got him with you
Jhn  The servants made answer No man ever said things like this man
Jhn  Then the Pharisees said to them Have you like the others been given false ideas
Jhn  Have any of the rulers belief in him or any one of the Pharisees
Jhn  But these people who have no knowledge of the law are cursed
Jhn  Nicodemushe who had come to Jesus before being himself one of themsaid to them
Jhn  Is a man judged by our law before it has given him a hearing and has knowledge of what he has done
Jhn  This was their answer And do you come from Galilee Make search and you will see that no prophet comes out of Galilee
Jhn  And every man went to his house
Jhn  But Jesus went to the Mountain of Olives
Jhn  And early in the morning he came again into the Temple and all the people came to him and he was seated teaching them
Jhn  Now the scribes and Pharisees came with a woman who had been taken in the act of sinning against the married relation
Jhn  And putting her forward they said to him Master this woman has been taken in the very act of sinning against the married relation
Jhn  Now in the law Moses gave directions that such women were to be stoned what do you say about it
Jhn  They said this testing him so that they might have something against him But Jesus with his head bent down made letters on the floor with his finger
Jhn  But when they went on with their questions he got up and said to them Let him among you who is without sin be the first to send a stone at her
Jhn  And again with bent head he made letters on the floor
Jhn  And when his words came to their ears they went out one by one starting with the oldest even to the last because they were conscious of what was in their hearts and Jesus was there by himself with the woman before him
Jhn  Then Jesus got up and seeing nobody but the woman he said to her Where are the men who said things against you did no one give a decision against you
Jhn  And she said No man Lord And Jesus said And I do not give a decision against you go and never do wrong again
Jhn  Then again Jesus said to them I am the light of the world he who comes with me will not be walking in the dark but will have the light of life
Jhn  So the Pharisees said to him The witness you give is about yourself your witness is not true
Jhn  Jesus said in answer Even if I give witness about myself my witness is true because I have knowledge of where I came from and where I am going but you have no knowledge of where I come from or of where I am going
Jhn  You are judging from what you see I am judging no man
Jhn  Even if I am judging my decision is right because I am not by myselfwith me is the Father who sent me
Jhn  Even in your law it is said that the witness of two men is true
Jhn  I give witness about myself and the Father who sent me gives witness about me
Jhn  Then they said to him Where is your Father Jesus said in answer You have no knowledge of me or of my Father if you had knowledge of me you would have knowledge of my Father
Jhn  Jesus said these words in the place where the offerings were stored while he was teaching in the Temple but no man took him because his time was still to come
Jhn  Then he said to them again I am going away and you will be looking for me but death will overtake you in your sins It is not possible for you to come where I am going
Jhn  So the Jews said Will he take his life Is that why he says Where I go it is not possible for you to come
Jhn  And he said to them You are of the earth I am from heaven you are of this world I am not of this world
Jhn  For this reason I said to you that death will overtake you in your sins for if you have not faith that I am he death will come to you while you are in your sins
Jhn  Then they said to him Who are you Jesus said What I said to you from the first
Jhn  I have much to say about you and against you but he who sent me is true and what he has said to me I say to the world
Jhn  They did not see that his words were about the Father
Jhn  So Jesus said When the Son of man has been lifted up by you then it will be clear to you who I am and that I do nothing of myself but say as the Father gave me teaching
Jhn  He who sent me is with me he has not gone from me because at all times I do the things which are pleasing to him
Jhn  When he said this a number came to have faith in him
Jhn  Then Jesus said to the Jews who had faith in him If you keep my word then you are truly my disciples
Jhn  And you will have knowledge of what is true and that will make you free
Jhn  They said to him in answer We are Abrahams seed and have never been any mans servant why do you say You will become free
Jhn  And this was the answer Jesus gave them Truly I say to you Everyone who does evil is the servant of sin
Jhn  Now the servant does not go on living in the house for ever but the son does
Jhn  If then the son makes you free you will be truly free
Jhn  I am conscious that you are Abrahams seed but you have a desire to put me to death because my word has no place in you
Jhn  I say the things which I have seen in my Fathers house and you do the things which come to you from your fathers house
Jhn  In answer they said to him Our father is Abraham Jesus said to them If you were Abrahams children you would do what Abraham did
Jhn  But now you have a desire to put me to death a man who has said to you what is true as I had it from God Abraham did not do that
Jhn  You are doing the works of your father They said to him We are true sons of Abraham we have one Father who is God
Jhn  Jesus said to them If God was your Father you would have love for me because it was from God I came and am here I did not come of myself but he sent me
Jhn  Why are my words not clear to you It is because your ears are shut to my teaching
Jhn  You are the children of your father the Evil One and it is your pleasure to do his desires From the first he was a taker of life and he did not go in the true way because there is no true thing in him When he says what is false it is natural to him for he is false and the father of what is false
Jhn  But because I say what is true you have no belief in me
Jhn  Which of you is able truly to say that I am a sinner If I say what is true why have you no belief in me
Jhn  He who is a child of God gives ear to the words of God your ears are not open to them because you are not from God
Jhn  The Jews said to him in answer Are we not right in saying that you are of Samaria and have an evil spirit
Jhn  And this was the answer of Jesus I have not an evil spirit but I give honour to my Father and you do not give honour to me
Jhn  I however am not in search of glory for myself there is One who is searching for it and he is judge
Jhn  Truly I say to you If a man keeps my word he will never see death
Jhn  The Jews said to him Now we are certain that you have an evil spirit Abraham is dead and the prophets are dead and you say If a man keeps my word he will never see death
Jhn  Are you greater than our father Abraham who is dead and the prophets are dead who do you say that you are
Jhn  Jesus said in answer If I take glory for myself my glory is nothing it is my Father who gives me glory of whom you say that he is your God
Jhn  You have no knowledge of him but I have knowledge of him and if I said I have no knowledge of him I would be talking falsely like you but I have full knowledge of him and I keep his word
Jhn  Your father Abraham was full of joy at the hope of seeing my day he saw it and was glad
Jhn  Then the Jews said to him You are not fifty years old have you seen Abraham
Jhn  Jesus said to them Truly I say to you Before Abraham came into being I am
Jhn  So they took up stones to send at him but Jesus got secretly out of their way and went out of the Temple
Jhn  And when he went on his way he saw a man blind from birth
Jhn  And his disciples put a question to him saying Master was it because of this mans sin or the sin of his father and mother that he has been blind from birth
Jhn  Jesus said in answer It was not because of his sin or because of his fathers or mothers it was so that the works of God might be seen openly in him
Jhn  While it is day we have to do the works of him who sent me the night comes when no work may be done
Jhn  As long as I am in the world I am the light of the world
Jhn  Having said these words he put earth mixed with water from his mouth on the mans eyes
Jhn  And said to him Go and make yourself clean in the bath of Siloam the sense of the name is Sent So he went away and after washing came back able to see
Jhn  Then the neighbours and others who had seen him before in the street with his hand out for money said Is not this the man who got money from people
Jhn  Some said It is he others said No but he is like him He said I am he
Jhn  So they said to him How then were your eyes made open
Jhn  His answer was The man who is named Jesus put earth mixed with water on my eyes and said to me Go and make yourself clean in Siloam so I went away and after washing am now able to see
Jhn  And they said to him Where is he His answer was I have no knowledge
Jhn  They took him before the Phariseesthis man who had been blind
Jhn  Now the day on which the earth was mixed by Jesus and the mans eyes were made open was the Sabbath
Jhn  So the Pharisees put more questions to him about how his eyes had been made open And he said to them He put earth on my eyes and I had a wash and am able to see
Jhn  Then some of the Pharisees said That man has not come from God for he does not keep the Sabbath Others said How is it possible for a sinner to do such signs So there was a division among them
Jhn  Again they said to the blind man What have you to say about him for opening your eyes And he said He is a prophet
Jhn  Now the Jews had no belief in the statement that he had been blind and was now able to see till they sent for the father and mother of the man whose eyes had been made open
Jhn  And put the question to them saying Is this your son of whom you say that he was blind at birth how is it then that he is now able to see
Jhn  In answer his father and mother said We are certain that this is our son and that he was blind at birth
Jhn  But how it is he is now able to see or who made his eyes open we are not able to say put the question to him he is old enough to give an answer for himself
Jhn  They said this because of their fear of the Jews for the Jews had come to an agreement that if any man said that Jesus was the Christ he would be put out of the Synagogue
Jhn  That was the reason why they said He is old enough put the question to him
Jhn  So they sent a second time for the man who had been blind and they said to him Give glory to God it is clear to us that this man is a sinner
Jhn  He said in answer I have no knowledge if he is a sinner or not but one thing I am certain about I was blind and now I see
Jhn  Then they said to him What did he do to you how did he give you the use of your eyes
Jhn  His answer was I have said it before but your ears were shut why would you have me say it again is it your desire to become his disciples
Jhn  And they were angry with him and said You are his disciple but we are disciples of Moses
Jhn  We are certain that God gave his word to Moses but as for this man we have no knowledge where he comes from
Jhn  The man said in answer Why here is a strange thing You have no knowledge where he comes from though he gave me the use of my eyes
Jhn  We have knowledge that God does not give ear to sinners but if any man is a worshipper of God and does his pleasure to him Gods ears are open
Jhn  In all the years nobody has ever before seen the eyes of a man blind from birth made open
Jhn  If this man did not come from God he would be unable to do anything
Jhn  Their answer was You came to birth through sin do you make yourself our teacher And they put him out of the Synagogue
Jhn  It came to the ears of Jesus that they had put him out and meeting him he said Have you faith in the Son of man
Jhn  He said in answer And who is he Lord Say so that I may have faith in him
Jhn  Jesus said to him You have seen him it is he who is talking to you
Jhn  And he said Lord I have faith And he gave him worship
Jhn  And Jesus said I came into this world to be a judge so that those who do not see may see and those who see may become blind
Jhn  These words came to the ears of the Pharisees who were with him and they said to him Are we then blind
Jhn  Jesus said to them If you were blind you would have no sin but now that you say We see your sin is there still
Jhn  Truly I say to you He who does not go through the door into the place where the sheep are kept but gets in by some other way is a thief and an outlaw
Jhn  He who goes in by the door is the keeper of the sheep
Jhn  The porter lets him in and the sheep give ear to his voice he says over the names of the sheep and takes them out
Jhn  When he has got them all out he goes before them and the sheep go after him for they have knowledge of his voice
Jhn  They will not go after another who is not their keeper but will go from him in flight because his voice is strange to them
Jhn  In this Jesus was teaching them in the form of a story but what he said was not clear to them
Jhn  So Jesus said again Truly I say to you I am the door of the sheep
Jhn  All who came before me are thieves and outlaws but the sheep did not give ear to them
Jhn  I am the door if any man goes in through me he will have salvation and will go in and go out and will get food
Jhn  The thief comes only to take the sheep and to put them to death he comes for their destruction I have come so that they may have life and have it in greater measure
Jhn  I am the good keeper of sheep the good keeper gives his life for the sheep
Jhn  He who is a servant and not the keeper or the owner of the sheep sees the wolf coming and goes in flight away from the sheep and the wolf comes down on them and sends them in all directions
Jhn  Because he is a servant he has no interest in the sheep
Jhn  I am the good keeper I have knowledge of my sheep and they have knowledge of me
Jhn  Even as the Father has knowledge of me and I of the Father and I am giving my life for the sheep
Jhn  And I have other sheep which are not of this field I will be their guide in the same way and they will give ear to my voice so there will be one flock and one keeper
Jhn  For this reason am I loved by the Father because I give up my life so that I may take it again
Jhn  No one takes it away from me I give it up of myself I have power to give it up and I have power to take it again These orders I have from my Father
Jhn  There was a division again among the Jews because of these words
Jhn  And a number of them said He has an evil spirit and is out of his mind why do you give ear to him
Jhn  Others said These are not the words of one who has an evil spirit Is it possible for an evil spirit to make blind people see
Jhn  Then came the feast of the opening of the Temple in Jerusalem it was winter
Jhn  And Jesus was walking in the Temple in Solomons covered way
Jhn  Then the Jews came round him saying how long are you going to keep us in doubt If you are the Christ say so clearly
Jhn  Jesus said in answer I have said it and you have no belief the works which I do in my Fathers name these give witness about me
Jhn  But you have no belief because you are not of my sheep
Jhn  My sheep give ear to my voice and I have knowledge of them and they come after me
Jhn  And I give them eternal life they will never come to destruction and no one will ever take them out of my hand
Jhn  That which my Father has given to me has more value than all and no one is able to take anything out of the Fathers hand
Jhn  I and my Father are one
Jhn  Then the Jews took up stones again to send at him
Jhn  Jesus said to them in answer I have let you see a number of good works from the Father for which of those works are you stoning me
Jhn  This was their answer We are not stoning you for a good work but for evil words because being a man you make yourself God
Jhn  In answer Jesus said Is there not a saying in your law I said You are gods
Jhn  If he said they were gods to whom the word of God came and the Writings may not be broken
Jhn  Do you say of him whom the Father made holy and sent into the world Your words are evil because I said I am Gods Son
Jhn  If I am not doing the works of my Father do not have belief in me
Jhn  But if I am doing them then have belief in the works even if you have no belief in me so that you may see clearly and be certain that the Father is in me and I am in the Father
Jhn  Then again they made an attempt to take him but he got away from them
Jhn  And he went again to the other side of the Jordan to the place where John first gave baptism and he was there for a time
Jhn  And a great number of people came to him saying John did no sign but everything John said of this man was true
Jhn  And a number came to have faith in him there
Jhn  Now a certain man named Lazarus was ill he was of Bethany the town of Mary and her sister Martha
Jhn  The Mary whose brother Lazarus was ill was the Mary who put perfumed oil on the Lord and made his feet dry with her hair
Jhn  So the sisters sent to him saying Lord your dear friend is ill
Jhn  When this came to his ears Jesus said The end of this disease is not death but the glory of God so that the Son of God may have glory because of it
Jhn  Now Jesus had love in his heart for Martha and her sister and Lazarus
Jhn  So when the news came to him that Lazarus was ill he did not go from the place where he was for two days
Jhn  Then after that time he said to his disciples Let us go into Judaea again
Jhn  The disciples said to him Master the Jews were attempting only the other day to have you stoned and are you going back there again
Jhn  Then Jesus said in answer Are there not twelve hours in the day A man may go about in the day without falling because he sees the light of this world
Jhn  But if a man goes about in the night he may have a fall because the light is not in him
Jhn  These things said he and after that he said to them Lazarus our friend is at rest but I go so that I may make him come out of his sleep
Jhn  Then his disciples said to him Lord if he is resting he will get well
Jhn  Jesus however was talking of his death but they had the idea that he was talking about taking rest in sleep
Jhn  Then Jesus said to them clearly Lazarus is dead
Jhn  And because of you I am glad I was not there so that you may have faith but let us go to him
Jhn  Then Thomas who was named Didymus said to the other disciples Let us go so that we may be with him in death
Jhn  Now when Jesus came he made the discovery that Lazarus had been put into the earth four days before
Jhn  Now Bethany was near to Jerusalem about two miles away
Jhn  And a number of Jews had come to Martha and Mary to give them comfort about their brother
Jhn  When Martha had the news that Jesus was on the way she went out to him but Mary did not go from the house
Jhn  Then Martha said to Jesus Lord if you had been here my brother would not be dead
Jhn  But I am certain that even now whatever request you make to God God will give it to you
Jhn  Jesus said to her Your brother will come to life again
Jhn  Martha said to him I am certain that he will come to life again when all come back from the dead at the last day
Jhn  Jesus said to her I am myself that day and that life he who has faith in me will have life even if he is dead
Jhn  And no one who is living and has faith in me will ever see death Is this your faith
Jhn  She said to him Yes Lord my faith is that you are the Christ the Son of God who was to come into the world
Jhn  And having said this she went away and said secretly to her sister Mary The Master is here and has sent for you
Jhn  And Mary hearing this got up quickly and went to him
Jhn  Now Jesus had not at this time come into the town but was still in the place where Martha had seen him
Jhn  Then the Jews who were with her in the house comforting her when they saw Mary get up quickly and go out went after her in the belief that she was going to the place of the dead and would be weeping there
Jhn  When Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him she went down at his feet saying Lord if you had been here my brother would not be dead
Jhn  And when Jesus saw her weeping and saw the Jews weeping who came with her his spirit was moved and he was troubled
Jhn  And said Where have you put him They said Come and see Lord
Jhn  And Jesus himself was weeping
Jhn  So the Jews said See how dear he was to him
Jhn  But some of them said This man who made open the eyes of the blind man was he not able to keep his friend from death
Jhn  So Jesus deeply troubled in heart came to the place of the dead It was a hole in the rock and a stone was over the opening
Jhn  Jesus said Take away the stone Martha the sister of him who was dead said Lord by this time the body will be smelling for he has been dead four days
Jhn  Jesus said to her Did I not say to you that if you had faith you would see the glory of God
Jhn  So they took away the stone And Jesus looking up to heaven said Father I give praise to you for hearing me
Jhn  I was certain that your ears are at all times open to me but I said it because of these who are here so that they may see that you sent me
Jhn  Then he said in a loud voice Lazarus come out
Jhn  And he who was dead came out with linen bands folded tightly about his hands and feet and a cloth about his face Jesus said to them Make him free and let him go
Jhn  Then a number of the Jews who had come to Mary and had seen the things which Jesus did had belief in him
Jhn  But some of them went to the Pharisees with the news of what Jesus had done
Jhn  Then the high priests and the Pharisees had a meeting and said What are we doing This man is doing a number of signs
Jhn  If we let him go on in this way everybody will have belief in him and the Romans will come and take away our place and our nation
Jhn  But one of them Caiaphas who was high priest that year said to them You have no knowledge of anything
Jhn  You do not see that it is in your interest for one man to be put to death for the people so that all the nation may not come to destruction
Jhn  He did not say this of himself but being the high priest that year he said as a prophet that Jesus would be put to death for the nation
Jhn  And not for that nation only but for the purpose of uniting in one body the children of God all over the world
Jhn  And from that day they took thought together how to put him to death
Jhn  So Jesus no longer went about publicly among the Jews but went from there into the country near to the waste land to a town named Ephraim where he was for some time with the disciples
Jhn  Now the Passover of the Jews was near and numbers of people went up from the country to Jerusalem to make themselves clean before the Passover
Jhn  They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another while they were in the Temple What is your opinion Will he not come to the feast
Jhn  Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone had knowledge where he was he was to give them word so that they might take him
Jhn  Then six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany where Lazarus was whom Jesus had made to come back from the dead
Jhn  So they made him a meal there and he was waited on by Martha and Lazarus was among those who were seated with him at table
Jhn  Then Mary taking a pound of perfumed oil of great value put it on the feet of Jesus and made them dry with her hair and the house became full of the smell of the perfume
Jhn  But one of his disciples Judas Iscariot who was to give him up said
Jhn  Why was not this perfume traded for three hundred pence and the money given to the poor
Jhn  He said this not because he had any love for the poor but because he was a thief and having the moneybag took for himself what was put into it
Jhn  Then Jesus said Let her be Let her keep what she has for the day of my death
Jhn  The poor you have ever with you but me you have not for ever
Jhn  Then a great number of the Jews had news that he was there and they came not only because of Jesus but so that they might see Lazarus who had been dead and to whom he had given life
Jhn  Now there was talk among the chief priests of putting Lazarus to death
Jhn  For because of him a great number of the Jews went away and had belief in Jesus
Jhn  The day after a great number of people who were there for the feast when they had the news that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem
Jhn  Took branches of palmtrees and went out to him crying A blessing on him who comes in the name of the Lord the King of Israel
Jhn  And Jesus saw a young ass and took his seat on it as the Writings say
Jhn  Have no fear daughter of Zion see your King is coming seated on a young ass
Jhn  These things were not clear to his disciples at first but when Jesus had been lifted up into his glory then it came to their minds that these things in the Writings were about him and that they had been done to him
Jhn  Now the people who were with him when his voice came to Lazarus in the place of the dead and gave him life again had been talking about it
Jhn  And that was the reason the people went out to him because it had come to their ears that he had done this sign
Jhn  Then the Pharisees said one to another You see you are unable to do anything the world has gone after him
Jhn  Now there were some Greeks among the people who had come up to give worship at the feast
Jhn  They came to Philip who was of Bethsaida in Galilee and made a request saying Sir we have a desire to see Jesus
Jhn  Philip went and gave word of it to Andrew and Andrew went with Philip to Jesus
Jhn  And Jesus said to them in answer The hour of the glory of the Son of man has come
Jhn  Truly I say to you If a seed of grain does not go into the earth and come to an end it is still a seed and no more but through its death it gives much fruit
Jhn  He who is in love with life will have it taken from him and he who has no care for his life in this world will keep it for ever and ever
Jhn  If any man is my servant let him come after me and where I am there will my servant be If any man becomes my servant my Father will give him honour
Jhn  Now is my soul troubled and what am I to say Father keep me from this hour No for this purpose have I come to this hour
Jhn  Father give glory to your name Then there came a voice out of heaven saying I have given it glory and I will give it glory again
Jhn  Hearing the sound a number of people who were there said that it was thunder others said An angel was talking to him
Jhn  Jesus said in answer This voice came not for me but for you
Jhn  Now is this world to be judged now will the ruler of this world be sent out
Jhn  And I if I am lifted up from the earth will make all men come to me
Jhn  This he said pointing to the sort of death he would have
Jhn  Then the people in answer said to him The law says that the Christ will have life without end how say you then that it is necessary for the Son of man to be lifted up Who is this Son of man
Jhn  Jesus said to them For a little time longer the light will be among you while you have the light go on walking in it so that the dark may not overtake you one walking in the dark has no knowledge of where he is going
Jhn  In so far as you have the light put your faith in the light so that you may become sons of light With these words Jesus went away and for a time was not seen again by them
Jhn  But though he had done such a number of signs before them they still had no belief in him
Jhn  So that the words of the prophet Isaiah might come true when he said Lord who has any belief in our preaching and the arm of the Lord to whom has it been unveiled
Jhn  For this reason they were unable to have belief because Isaiah said again
Jhn  He has made their eyes blind and their hearts hard for fear that they might see with their eyes and get knowledge with their hearts and be changed and I might make them well
Jhn  Isaiah said these words because he saw his glory His words were about him
Jhn  However a number even of the rulers had belief in him but because of the Pharisees they did not say so openly for fear that they might be shut out from the Synagogue
Jhn  For the praise of men was dearer to them than the approval of God
Jhn  Then Jesus said with a loud voice He who has faith in me has faith not in me but in him who sent me
Jhn  And he who sees me sees him who sent me
Jhn  I have come as a light into the world so that no one who has faith in me will go on living in the dark
Jhn  And if any man gives ear to my words and does not keep them I am not his judge I did not come to be judge of the world but to give salvation to the world
Jhn  He who puts me on one side and does not take my words to heart is not without a judge the word which I have said will be his judge on the last day
Jhn  For I have not said it on my authority but the Father who sent me gave me orders what to say and how to say it
Jhn  And I have knowledge that his order is eternal life so that the things which I say I say them even as the Father says them to me
Jhn  Now before the feast of the Passover it was clear to Jesus that the time had come for him to go away from this world to the Father Having once had love for those in the world who were his his love for them went on to the end
Jhn  So while a meal was going on the Evil One having now put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot Simons son to be false to him
Jhn  Jesus being conscious that the Father had put everything into his hands and that he came from God and was going to God
Jhn  Got up from table put off his robe and took a cloth and put it round him
Jhn  Then he put water into a basin and was washing the feet of the disciples and drying them with the cloth which was round him
Jhn  So he came to Simon Peter Peter said Lord are my feet to be washed by you
Jhn  And Jesus answering said to him What I do is not clear to you now but it will be clear to you in time to come
Jhn  Peter said I will never let my feet be washed by you never Jesus said in answer If I do not make you clean you have no part with me
Jhn  Simon Peter said to him Lord not my feet only but my hands and my head
Jhn  Jesus said to him He who is bathed has need only to have his feet washed and then he is clean all over and you my disciples are clean but not all of you
Jhn  He had knowledge who was false to him that is why he said You are not all clean
Jhn  Then after washing their feet and putting on his robe again he took his seat and said to them Do you see what I have done to you
Jhn  You give me the name of Master and Lord and you are right that is what I am
Jhn  If then I the Lord and the Master have made your feet clean it is right for you to make one anothers feet clean
Jhn  I have given you an example so that you may do what I have done to you
Jhn  Truly I say to you A servant is not greater than his lord and he who is sent is not greater than the one who sent him
Jhn  If these things are clear to you happy are you if you do them
Jhn  I am not talking of you all I have knowledge of my true disciples but things are as they are so that the Writings may come true The foot of him who takes bread with me is lifted up against me
Jhn  From this time forward I give you knowledge of things before they come about so that when they come about you may have belief that I am he
Jhn  Truly I say to you He who takes to his heart anyone whom I send takes me to his heart and he who so takes me takes him who sent me
Jhn  When Jesus had said this he was troubled in spirit and gave witness saying Truly I say to you that one of you will be false to me
Jhn  Then the eyes of the disciples were turned on one another in doubt as to whom he had in mind
Jhn  There was at table one of his disciples the one dear to Jesus resting his head on Jesus breast
Jhn  Making a sign to him Simon Peter said Who is it he is talking about
Jhn  He then resting his head on Jesus breast said to him Lord who is it
Jhn  This was the answer Jesus gave It is the one to whom I will give this bit of bread after I have put it in the vessel Then he took the bit of bread put it into the vessel and gave it to Judas the son of Simon Iscariot
Jhn  And when Judas took the bread Satan went into him Then Jesus said to him Do quickly what you have to do
Jhn  Now it was not clear to anyone at table why he said this to him
Jhn  Some were of the opinion that because Judas kept the moneybag Jesus said to him Get the things we have need of for the feast or that he was to give something to the poor
Jhn  So Judas having taken the bit of bread straight away went out and it was night
Jhn  Then when he had gone out Jesus said Now is glory given to the Son of man and God is given glory in him
Jhn  If God is given glory in him God will give him glory in himself and will give him glory even now
Jhn  My dear children I am only to be with you a little longer Then you will be looking for me and as I said to the Jews so now I say to you Where I am going you may not come
Jhn  I give you a new law Have love one for another even as I have had love for you so are you to have love one for another
Jhn  By this it will be clear to all men that you are my disciples if you have love one for another
Jhn  Simon Peter said to him Lord where are you going Jesus said in answer Where I am going you may not come with me now but you will come later
Jhn  Peter said to him Why may I not come with you even now I will give up my life for you
Jhn  Jesus said in answer Will you give up your life for me Truly I say to you Before the cry of the cock you will have said three times that you are not my disciple
Jhn  Let not your heart be troubled have faith in God and have faith in me
Jhn  In my Fathers house are rooms enough if it was not so would I have said that I am going to make ready a place for you
Jhn  And if I go and make ready a place for you I will come back again and will take you to be with me so that you may be where I am
Jhn  And you all have knowledge of where I am going and of the way to it
Jhn  Thomas said Lord we have no knowledge of where you are going how may we have knowledge of the way
Jhn  Jesus said to him I am the true and living way no one comes to the Father but by me
Jhn  If you had knowledge of me you would have knowledge of my Father you have knowledge of him now and have seen him
Jhn  Philip said to him Lord let us see the Father and we have need of nothing more
Jhn  Jesus said to him Philip have I been with you all this time and still you have no knowledge of me He who has seen me has seen the Father Why do you say Let us see the Father
Jhn  Have you not faith that I am in the Father and the Father is in me The words which I say to you I say not from myself but the Father who is in me all the time does his works
Jhn  Have faith that I am in the Father and that the Father is in me at least have faith in me because of what I do
Jhn  Truly I say to you He who puts his faith in me will do the very works which I do and he will do greater things than these because I am going to my Father
Jhn  And whatever request you make in my name that I will do so that the Father may have glory in the Son
Jhn  If you make any request to me in my name I will do it
Jhn  If you have love for me you will keep my laws
Jhn  And I will make prayer to the Father and he will give you another Helper to be with you for ever
Jhn  Even the Spirit of true knowledge That Spirit the world is not able to take to its heart because it sees him not and has no knowledge of him but you have knowledge of him because he is ever with you and will be in you
Jhn  I will not let you be without a friend I am coming to you
Jhn  A little time longer and the world will see me no more but you will see me and you will be living because I am living
Jhn  At that time it will be clear to you that I am in my Father and you are in me and I in you
Jhn  He who has my laws and keeps them he it is who has love for me and he who has love for me will be loved by my Father and I will have love for him and will let myself be seen clearly by him
Jhn  Judas not Iscariot said to him How is it that you will let yourself be seen clearly by us and not by the world
Jhn  Jesus said to him in answer If anyone has love for me he will keep my words and he will be dear to my Father and we will come to him and make our livingplace with him
Jhn  He who has no love for me does not keep my words and the word which you are hearing is not my word but the Fathers who sent me
Jhn  I have said all this to you while I am still with you
Jhn  But the Helper the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name will be your teacher in all things and will put you in mind of everything I have said to you
Jhn  May peace be with you my peace I give to you I give it not as the world gives Let not your heart be troubled let it be without fear
Jhn  Keep in mind how I said to you I go away and come to you again If you had love for me you would be glad because I am going to the Father for the Father is greater than I
Jhn  And now I have given you word of it before it comes so that when it comes you may have faith
Jhn  After this I will not say much to you because the ruler of this world comes and he has no power over me
Jhn  But he comes so that the world may see that I have love for the Father and that I am doing as I am ordered by the Father Get up and let us go
Jhn  I am the true vine and my Father is the gardener
Jhn  He takes away every branch in me which has no fruit and every branch which has fruit he makes clean so that it may have more fruit
Jhn  You are clean even now through the teaching which I have given you
Jhn  Be in me at all times as I am in you As the branch is not able to give fruit of itself if it is not still on the vine so you are not able to do so if you are not in me
Jhn  I am the vine you are the branches he who is in me at all times as I am in him gives much fruit because without me you are able to do nothing
Jhn  If a man does not keep himself in me he becomes dead and is cut off like a dry branch such branches are taken up and put in the fire and burned
Jhn  If you are in me at all times and my words are in you then anything for which you make a request will be done for you
Jhn  Here is my Fathers glory in that you give much fruit and so are my true disciples
Jhn  Even as the Father has given me his love so I have given my love to you be ever in my love
Jhn  If you keep my laws you will be ever in my love even as I have kept my Fathers laws and am ever in his love
Jhn  I have said these things to you so that I may have joy in you and so that your joy may be complete
Jhn  This is the law I give you Have love one for another even as I have love for you
Jhn  Greater love has no man than this that a man gives up his life for his friends
Jhn  You are my friends if you do what I give you orders to do
Jhn  No longer do I give you the name of servants because a servant is without knowledge of what his master is doing I give you the name of friends because I have given you knowledge of all the things which my Father has said to me
Jhn  You did not take me for yourselves but I took you for myself and I gave you the work of going about and producing fruit which will be for ever so that whatever request you make to the Father in my name he may give it to you
Jhn  So this is my law for you Have love one for another
Jhn  If you are hated by the world keep in mind that I was hated by the world before you
Jhn  If you were of the world you would be loved by the world but because you are not of the world but I have taken you out of the world you are hated by the world
Jhn  Keep in mind the words I said to you A servant is not greater than his lord If they were cruel to me they will be cruel to you if they kept my words they will keep yours
Jhn  They will do all this to you because of my namebecause they have no knowledge of him who sent me
Jhn  If I had not come and been their teacher they would have had no sin but now they have no reason to give for their sin
Jhn  He who has hate for me has hate for my Father
Jhn  If I had not done among them the works which no other man ever did they would have had no sin but now they have seen and they have had hate in their hearts for me and my Father
Jhn  This comes about so that the writing in their law may be made true Their hate for me was without cause
Jhn  When the Helper comes whom I will send to you from the Father even the Spirit of true knowledge who comes from the Fatherhe will give witness about me
Jhn  And you in addition will give witness because you have been with me from the first
Jhn  I have said these things to you so that you may not be in doubt
Jhn  They will put you out of the Synagogues yes the time is coming when whoever puts you to death will have the belief that he is doing Gods pleasure
Jhn  They will do these things to you because they have not had knowledge of the Father or of me
Jhn  I have said these things to you so that when the time comes what I have said may come to your mind I did not say them to you at the first because then I was still with you
Jhn  But now I am going to him who sent me and not one of you says to me Where are you going
Jhn  But your hearts are full of sorrow because I have said these things
Jhn  But what I am saying is true my going is for your good for if I do not go away the Helper will not come to you but if I go I will send him to you
Jhn  And he when he comes will make the world conscious of sin and of righteousness and of being judged
Jhn  Of sin because they have not faith in me
Jhn  Of righteousness because I go to the Father and you will see me no more
Jhn  Of being judged because the ruler of this world has been judged
Jhn  I have still much to say to you but you are not strong enough for it now
Jhn  However when he the Spirit of true knowledge has come he will be your guide into all true knowledge for his words will not come from himself but whatever has come to his hearing that he will say and he will make clear to you the things to come
Jhn  He will give me glory because he will take of what is mine and make it clear to you
Jhn  Everything which the Father has is mine that is why I say He will take of what is mine and will make it clear to you
Jhn  After a little time you will see me no longer and then again after a little time you will see me
Jhn  So some of the disciples said one to another What is this he is saying After a little time you will see me no longer and then again after a little time you will see me and I am going to the Father
Jhn  So they said again and again What is this he is saying A little time His words are not clear to us
Jhn  Jesus saw that they had a desire to put the question to him so he said to them Is this what you are questioning one with another why I said After a little time you will see me no longer and then again after a little time you will see me
Jhn  Truly I say to you You will be weeping and sorrowing but the world will be glad you will be sad but your sorrow will be turned into joy
Jhn  When a woman is about to give birth she has sorrow because her hour is come but when she has given birth to the child the pain is put out of her mind by the joy that a man has come into the world
Jhn  So you have sorrow now but I will see you again and your hearts will be glad and no one will take away your joy
Jhn  And on that day you will put no questions to me Truly I say to you Whatever request you make to the Father he will give it to you in my name
Jhn  Up to now you have made no request in my name do so and it will be answered so that your hearts may be full of joy
Jhn  All this I have said to you in veiled language but the time is coming when I will no longer say things in veiled language but will give you knowledge of the Father clearly
Jhn  In that day you will make requests in my name and I do not say that I will make prayer to the Father for you
Jhn  For the Father himself gives his love to you because you have given your love to me and have had faith that I came from God
Jhn  I came out from the Father and have come into the world again I go away from the world and go to the Father
Jhn  His disciples said Now you are talking clearly and not in veiled language
Jhn  Now we are certain that you have knowledge of all things and have no need for anyone to put questions to you through this we have faith that you came from God
Jhn  Jesus made answer Have you faith now
Jhn  See a time is coming yes it is now here when you will go away in all directions every man to his house and I will be by myself but I am not by myself because the Father is with me
Jhn  I have said all these things to you so that in me you may have peace In the world you have trouble but take heart I have overcome the world
Jhn  Jesus said these things then lifting his eyes to heaven he said Father the time has now come give glory to your Son so that the Son may give glory to you
Jhn  Even as you gave him authority over all flesh to give eternal life to all those whom you have given to him
Jhn  And this is eternal life to have knowledge of you the only true God and of him whom you have sent even Jesus Christ
Jhn  I have given you glory on the earth having done all the work which you gave me to do
Jhn  And now Father let me have glory with you even that glory which I had with you before the world was
Jhn  I have given knowledge of your name to the men whom you gave me out of the world yours they were and you gave them to me and they have kept your words
Jhn  Now it is clear to them that whatever you have given to me comes from you
Jhn  Because I have given them the words which you gave to me and they have taken them to heart and have certain knowledge that I came from you and they have faith that you sent me
Jhn  My prayer is for them my prayer is not for the world but for those whom you have given to me because they are yours
Jhn  All mine are yours and yours are mine and I have glory in them
Jhn  And now I will be no longer in the world but they are in the world and I come to you Holy Father keep them in your name which you have given to me so that they may be one even as we are one
Jhn  While I was with them I kept them safe in your name which you have given to me I took care of them and not one of them has come to destruction but only the son of destruction so that the Writings might come true
Jhn  And now I come to you and these things I say in the world so that they may have my joy complete in them
Jhn  I have given your word to them and they are hated by the world because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world
Jhn  My prayer is not that you will take them out of the world but that you will keep them from the Evil One
Jhn  They are not of the world any more than I am of the world
Jhn  Make them holy by the true word your word is the true word
Jhn  Even as you have sent me into the world so I have sent them into the world
Jhn  And for them I make myself holy so that they may be made truly holy
Jhn  My prayer is not for them only but for all who will have faith in me through their word
Jhn  May they all be one Even as you Father are in me and I am in you so let them be in us so that all men may come to have faith that you sent me
Jhn  And the glory which you have given to me I have given to them so that they may be one even as we are one
Jhn  I in them and you in me so that they may be made completely one and so that it may become clear to all men that you have sent me and that they are loved by you as I am loved by you
Jhn  Father it is my desire that these whom you have given to me may be by my side where I am so that they may see my glory which you have given to me because you had love for me before the world came into being
Jhn  Father of righteousness I have knowledge of you though the world has not and to these it is clear that you sent me
Jhn  And I have given to them knowledge of your name and will give it so that the love which you have for me may be in them and I in them
Jhn  When Jesus had said these words he went out with his disciples over the stream Kedron to a garden into which he went with his disciples
Jhn  And Judas who was false to him had knowledge of the place because Jesus went there frequently with his disciples
Jhn  So Judas getting a band of armed men and police from the chief priests and Pharisees went there with lights and with arms
Jhn  Then Jesus having knowledge of everything which was coming on him went forward and said to them Who are you looking for
Jhn  Their answer was Jesus the Nazarene Jesus said I am he And Judas who was false to him was there at their side
Jhn  And when he said to them I am he they went back falling to the earth
Jhn  So again he put the question to them Who are you looking for And they said Jesus the Nazarene
Jhn  Jesus made answer I have said that I am he if you are looking for me let these men go away
Jhn  He said this so that his words might come true I have kept safe all those whom you gave to me
Jhn  Then Simon Peter who had a sword took it out and gave the high priests servant a blow cutting off his right ear The servants name was Malchus
Jhn  Then Jesus said to Peter Put back your sword am I not to take the cup which my Father has given to me
Jhn  Then the band and the chief captain and the police took Jesus and put cords round him
Jhn  They took him first to Annas because Annas was the fatherinlaw of Caiaphas who was the high priest that year
Jhn  It was Caiaphas who had said to the Jews that it was in their interest for one man to be put to death for the people
Jhn  And Simon Peter went after Jesus with another disciple Now that disciple was a friend of the high priest and he went in with Jesus into the house of the high priest
Jhn  But Peter was kept outside at the door Then this other disciple who was a friend of the high priest came out and had a word with the girl who kept the door and took Peter in
Jhn  Then the girl who was the doorkeeper said to Peter Are you not one of this mans disciples In answer he said I am not
Jhn  Now the servants and the police had made a fire of coals because it was cold they were warming themselves in front of it and Peter was there with them warming himself
Jhn  Then the high priest put questions to Jesus about his disciples and his teaching
Jhn  Jesus made answer I said things openly to the world at all times I have given my teaching in the Synagogues and in the Temple to which all the Jews come and I have said nothing secretly
Jhn  Why are you questioning me put questions to my hearers about what I have said to them they have knowledge of what I said
Jhn  When he said this one of the police by his side gave him a blow with his open hand saying Do you give such an answer to the high priest
Jhn  Jesus said in answer If I have said anything evil give witness to the evil but if I said what is true why do you give me blows
Jhn  Then Annas sent him chained to Caiaphas the high priest
Jhn  But Simon Peter was still there warming himself by the fire They said to him Are you not one of his disciples He said No I am not
Jhn  One of the servants of the high priest a relation of him whose ear had been cut off by Peter said Did I not see you with him in the garden
Jhn  Then again Peter said No And straight away a cock gave its cry
Jhn  So they took Jesus from the house of Caiaphas to the Praetorium It was early They themselves did not go into the Praetorium so that they might not become unclean but might take the Passover
Jhn  So Pilate came out to them and put the question What have you to say against this man
Jhn  They said to him in answer If the man was not a wrongdoer we would not have given him up to you
Jhn  Then Pilate said to them Take him yourselves and let him be judged by your law But the Jews said to him We have no right to put any man to death
Jhn  That the word of Jesus might come true pointing to the sort of death he would have
Jhn  Then Pilate went back into the Praetorium and sent for Jesus and said to him Are you the King of the Jews
Jhn  Jesus made answer Do you say this of yourself or did others say it about me
Jhn  Pilate said Am I a Jew Your nation and the chief priests have given you into my hands what have you done
Jhn  Jesus said in answer My kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom was of this world my disciples would have made a good fight to keep me out of the hands of the Jews but my kingdom is not here
Jhn  Then Pilate said to him Are you then a king Jesus made answer You say that I am a king For this purpose was I given birth and for this purpose I came into the world that I might give witness to what is true Every lover of what is true gives ear to my voice
Jhn  Pilate said to him True what is true Having said this he went out again to the Jews and said to them I see no wrong in him
Jhn  But every year you make a request to me to let a prisoner go free at the Passover Is it your desire that I let the King of the Jews go free
Jhn  Then again they gave a loud cry Not this man but Barabbas Now Barabbas was an outlaw
Jhn  Then Pilate took Jesus and had him whipped with cords
Jhn  And the men of the army made a crown of thorns and put it on his head and they put a purple robe on him
Jhn  And they kept coming and saying Long life to the King of the Jews And they gave him blows with their hands
Jhn  And Pilate went out again and said to them See I let him come out to you to make it clear to you that I see no wrong in him
Jhn  Then Jesus came out with the crown of thorns and the purple robe And Pilate said to them Here is the man
Jhn  So when the chief priests and the police saw him they gave a loud cry To the cross to the cross Pilate said to them Take him yourselves and put him on the cross I see no crime in him
Jhn  And the Jews made answer We have a law and by that law it is right for him to be put to death because he said he was the Son of God
Jhn  When this saying came to Pilates ears his fear became greater
Jhn  And he went again into the Praetorium and said to Jesus Where do you come from But Jesus gave him no answer
Jhn  Then Pilate said to him You say nothing to me is it not clear to you that I have power to let you go free and power to put you to death on the cross
Jhn  Jesus gave this answer You would have no power at all over me if it was not given to you by God so that he who gave me up to you has the greater sin
Jhn  Hearing this Pilate had a desire to let him go free but the Jews said in a loud voice If you let this man go you are not Caesars friend everyone who makes himself a king goes against Caesar
Jhn  So when these words came to Pilates ear he took Jesus out seating himself in the judges seat in a place named in Hebrew Gabbatha or the Stone Floor
Jhn  It was the day when they made ready for the Passover and it was about the sixth hour And he said to the Jews There is your King
Jhn  Then they gave a loud cry Away with him away with him to the cross Pilate said to them Am I to put your King to death on the cross The chief priests said in answer We have no king but Caesar
Jhn  So then he gave him up to them to be put to death on the cross And they took Jesus away
Jhn  And he went out with his cross on him to the place which is named Dead Mans Head in Hebrew Golgotha
Jhn  Where they put him on the cross with two others one on this side and one on that and Jesus in the middle
Jhn  And Pilate put on the cross a statement in writing The writing was JESUS THE NAZARENE THE KING OF THE JEWS
Jhn  The writing was seen by a number of the Jews for the place where Jesus was put to death on the cross was near the town and the writing was in Hebrew and Latin and Greek
Jhn  Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate Do not put The King of the Jews but He said I am the King of the Jews
Jhn  But Pilate made answer What I have put in writing will not be changed
Jhn  And when Jesus was nailed to the cross the men of the army took his clothing and made a division of it into four parts to every man a part and they took his coat now the coat was without a join made out of one bit of cloth
Jhn  So they said among themselves Let this not be cut up but let us put it to the decision of chance and see who gets it They did this so that the Writings might come true which say They made a distribution of my clothing among them and my coat they put to the decision of chance This was what the men of the army did
Jhn  Now by the side of the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mothers sister Mary the wife of Cleopas and Mary Magdalene
Jhn  So when Jesus saw his mother and the disciple who was dear to him he said to his mother Mother there is your son
Jhn  Then he said to the disciple There is your mother And from that hour the disciple took her to his house
Jhn  After this being conscious that all things had now been done so that the Writings might come true Jesus said Give me water
Jhn  Now there was a vessel ready full of bitter wine and they put a sponge full of it on a stick and put it to his mouth
Jhn  So when Jesus had taken the wine he said All is done And with his head bent he gave up his spirit
Jhn  Now it was the day of getting ready for the Passover and so that the bodies might not be on the cross on the Sabbath because the day of that Sabbath was a great day the Jews made a request to Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away
Jhn  So the men of the army came and the legs of the first were broken and then of the other who was put to death on the cross with Jesus
Jhn  But when they came to Jesus they saw that he was dead by this time and so his legs were not broken
Jhn  But one of the men made a wound in his side with a spear and straight away there came out blood and water
Jhn  And he who saw it has given witness and his witness is true he is certain that what he says is true so that you may have belief
Jhn  These things came about so that the Writings might be true No bone of his body will be broken
Jhn  And again another verse says They will see him who was wounded by their spears
Jhn  After these things Joseph of Arimathaea who was a disciple of Jesus but secretly for fear of the Jews made a request to Pilate to let him take away the body of Jesus and Pilate said he might do so So he went and took away his body
Jhn  And Nicodemus came he who had first come to Jesus by night with a roll of myrrh and aloes mixed about a hundred pounds
Jhn  Then they took the body of Jesus folding linen about it with the spices as is the way of the Jews when they put the dead to rest
Jhn  Now there was a garden near the cross and in the garden a new place for the dead in which no man had ever been put
Jhn  So they put Jesus there because it was the Jews day of getting ready for the Passover and the place was near
Jhn  Now on the first day of the week very early while it was still dark Mary Magdalene came to the place and saw that the stone had been taken away from it
Jhn  Then she went running to Simon Peter and to the other disciple who was loved by Jesus and said to them They have taken away the Lord out of the place of the dead and we have no knowledge where they have put him
Jhn  So Peter and the other disciple went out to the place of the dead
Jhn  They went running together and the other disciple got in front of Peter and came first to the hole in the rock
Jhn  And looking in he saw the linen bands on the earth but he did not go in
Jhn  Then Simon Peter came after him and went into the hole in the rock and he saw the linen bands on the earth
Jhn  And the cloth which had been round his head not with the linen bands but rolled up in a place by itself
Jhn  Then the other disciple who came there first went in and he saw and belief came to him
Jhn  For at that time they had no knowledge that the Writings said that he would have to come again from the dead
Jhn  So then the disciples went away again to their houses
Jhn  But Mary was still there outside the hole in the rock weeping and while she was weeping and looking into the hole
Jhn  She saw two angels in white seated where the body of Jesus had been one at the head and the other at the feet
Jhn  They said to her Woman why are you weeping She said to them Because they have taken away my Lord and I have no knowledge where they have put him
Jhn  And then looking round she saw Jesus there but had no idea that it was Jesus
Jhn  Jesus said to her Woman why are you weeping who are you looking for She taking him for the gardener said to him Sir if you have taken him away from here say where you have put him and I will take him away
Jhn  Jesus said to her Mary Turning she said to him in Hebrew Rabboni which is to say Master
Jhn  Jesus said to her Do not put your hand on me for I have not gone up to the Father but go to my brothers and say to them I go up to my Father and your Father to my God and your God
Jhn  Mary Magdalene went with the news to the disciples and said she had seen the Lord and that he had said these things to her
Jhn  At evening on that day the first day of the week when for fear of the Jews the doors were shut where the disciples were Jesus came among them and said to them May peace be with you
Jhn  And when he had said this he let them see his hands and his side Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord
Jhn  And Jesus said to them again May peace be with you As the Father sent me even so I now send you
Jhn  And when he had said this breathing on them he said to them Let the Holy Spirit come on you
Jhn  Any to whom you give forgiveness will be made free from their sins and any from whom you keep back forgiveness will still be in their sins
Jhn  Now Thomas one of the twelve named Didymus was not with them when Jesus came
Jhn  So the other disciples said to him We have seen the Lord But he said to them If I do not see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and if I do not put my hand into his side I will never have belief
Jhn  And after eight days his disciples were again in the house and Thomas was with them Though the doors were shut Jesus came and taking his place in the middle of them he said May peace be with you
Jhn  Then he said to Thomas Put out your finger and see my hands and put your hand here into my side and be no longer in doubt but have belief
Jhn  And Thomas said in answer My Lord and my God
Jhn  Jesus said to him Because you have seen me you have belief a blessing will be on those who have belief though they have not seen me
Jhn  A number of other signs Jesus did before his disciples which are not recorded in this book
Jhn  But these are recorded so that you may have faith that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God and so that having this faith you may have life in his name
Jhn  After these things Jesus let himself be seen again by the disciples at the sea of Tiberias and it came about in this way
Jhn  Simon Peter Thomas named Didymus Nathanael of Cana in Galilee the sons of Zebedee and two others of his disciples were all together
Jhn  Simon Peter said to them I am going fishing They said to him And we will come with you They went out and got into the boat but that night they took no fish
Jhn  Now very early in the morning Jesus was there by the edge of the sea though the disciples were not conscious that it was Jesus
Jhn  So Jesus said to them Children have you taken any fish They made answer No
Jhn  And he said to them Let down the net on the right side of the boat and you will get some So they put it in the water and now they were not able to get it up again because of the great number of fish
Jhn  So the disciple who was dear to Jesus said to Peter It is the Lord Hearing that it was the Lord Peter put his coat round him because he was not clothed and went into the sea
Jhn  And the other disciples came in the little boat they were not far from land only about two hundred cubits off pulling the net full of fish
Jhn  When they got to land they saw a fire of coals there with fish cooking on it and bread
Jhn  Jesus said to them Get some of the fish which you have now taken
Jhn  So Peter went to the boat and came back pulling the net to land full of great fish a hundred and fiftythree and though there was such a number the net was not broken
Jhn  Jesus said to them Come and take some food And all the disciples were in fear of putting the question Who are you being conscious that it was the Lord
Jhn  Then Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them and the fish in the same way
Jhn  Now this was the third time that Jesus let himself be seen by the disciples after he had come back from the dead
Jhn  Then when they had taken food Jesus said to Simon Peter Simon son of John is your love for me greater than the love of these others He said to him Yes Lord you are certain of my love for you He said to him Then give my lambs food
Jhn  Again a second time he said to him Simon son of John have you any love for me Yes Lord he said you are certain of my love for you Then take care of my sheep said Jesus
Jhn  He said to him a third time Simon son of John am I dear to you Now Peter was troubled in his heart because he put the question a third time Am I dear to you And he said to him Lord you have knowledge of all things you see that you are dear to me Jesus said to him Then give my sheep food
Jhn  Truly I say to you When you were young you made yourself ready and went wherever you had a desire to go but when you are old you will put out your hands and another will make you ready and you will be taken where you have no desire to go
Jhn  Now this he said pointing out the sort of death by which he would give God glory And after saying this he said to him Come after me
Jhn  Then Peter turning round saw the disciple who was dear to Jesus coming after themthe disciple who was resting on his breast at the last meal and said Lord who is it who will be false to you
Jhn  Seeing him Peter said to Jesus What about this man
Jhn  Jesus said to him If it is my desire for him to be here till I come back what is that to you come yourself after me
Jhn  So this saying went about among the brothers that this disciple would not undergo death Jesus however did not say that he would not undergo death but If it is my desire for him to be here till I come back what is that to you
Jhn  This is the disciple who gives witness about these things and who put them in writing and we have knowledge that his witness is true
Jhn  And Jesus did such a number of other things that if every one was recorded it is my opinion that even the world itself is not great enough for the books there would be
Act  I have given an earlier account O Theophilus of all the things which Jesus did and of his teaching from the first
Act  Till the day when he was taken up to heaven after he had given his orders through the Holy Spirit to the Apostles of whom he had made selection
Act  And to whom he gave clear and certain signs that he was living after his death for he was seen by them for forty days and gave them teaching about the kingdom of God
Act  And when they were all together with him he gave them orders not to go away from Jerusalem but to keep there waiting till the word of the Father was put into effect of which he said I have given you knowledge
Act  For the baptism of John was with water but you will have baptism with the Holy Spirit after a little time
Act  So when they were together they said to him Lord will you at this time give back the kingdom to Israel
Act  And he said to them It is not for you to have knowledge of the time and the order of events which the Father has kept in his control
Act  But you will have power when the Holy Spirit has come on you and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and all Judaea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth
Act  And when he had said these things while they were looking he was taken up and went from their view into a cloud
Act  And while they were looking up to heaven with great attention two men came to them in white clothing
Act  And said O men of Galilee why are you looking up into heaven This Jesus who was taken from you into heaven will come again in the same way as you saw him go into heaven
Act  Then they went back to Jerusalem from the mountain named Olivet which is near Jerusalem a Sabbath days journey away
Act  And when they came in they went up into the room where they were living Peter and John and James and Andrew Philip and Thomas Bartholomew and Matthew James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas the son of James
Act  And they all with one mind gave themselves up to prayer with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus and his brothers
Act  And in those days Peter got up among the brothers there were about one hundred and twenty of them and said
Act  My brothers the word of God had to be put into effect which the Holy Spirit had said before by the mouth of David about Judas who was guide to those who took Jesus
Act  For he was numbered among us and had his part in our work
Act  Now this man with the reward of his evildoing got for himself a field and falling head first came to a sudden and violent end there
Act  And this came to the knowledge of all those who were living in Jerusalem so that the field was named in their language Akeldama or The field of blood
Act  For in the book of Psalms it says Let his house be waste and let no man be living in it and Let his position be taken by another
Act  For this reason of the men who have been with us all the time while the Lord Jesus went in and out among us
Act  Starting from the baptism of John till he went up from us one will have to be a witness with us of his coming back from death
Act  And they made selection of two Joseph named Barsabbas whose other name was Justus and Matthias
Act  And they made prayers and said Lord having knowledge of the hearts of all men make clear which of these two has been marked out by you
Act  To take that position as a servant and Apostle from which Judas by his sin was shut out so that he might go to his place
Act  And they put it to the decision of chance and the decision was given for Matthias and he was numbered with the eleven Apostles
Act  And when the day of Pentecost was come they were all together in one place
Act  And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like the rushing of a violent wind and all the house where they were was full of it
Act  And they saw tongues like flames of fire coming to rest on every one of them
Act  And they were all full of the Holy Spirit and were talking in different languages as the Spirit gave them power
Act  Now there were living at Jerusalem Jews Godfearing men from every nation under heaven
Act  And when this sound came to their ears they all came together and were greatly surprised because every man was hearing the words of the disciples in his special language
Act  And they were full of wonder and said Are not all these men Galilaeans
Act  And how is it that every one of us is hearing their words in the language which was ours from our birth
Act  Men of Parthia Media and Elam and those living in Mesopotamia in Judaea and Cappadocia in Pontus and Asia
Act  In Phrygia and Pamphylia in Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene and those who have come from Rome Jews by birth and others who have become Jews
Act  Men of Crete and Arabia to all of us they are talking in our different languages of the great works of God
Act  And they were all surprised and in doubt saying to one another What is the reason of this
Act  But others making sport of them said They are full of new wine
Act  But Peter getting up with the eleven said in a loud voice O men of Judaea and all you who are living in Jerusalem take note of this and give ear to my words
Act  For these men are not overcome with wine as it seems to you for it is only the third hour of the day
Act  But this is the thing which was said by the prophet Joel
Act  And it will come about in the last days says God that I will send out my Spirit on all flesh and your sons and your daughters will be prophets and your young men will see visions and your old men will have dreams
Act  And on my menservants and my womenservants I will send my Spirit and they will be prophets
Act  And wonders will be seen in heaven and signs on the earth blood and fire and smoke
Act  The sun will become dark and the moon will be turned to blood before that great day of the Lord comes in glory
Act  And whoever makes his prayer to the Lord will have salvation
Act  Men of Israel give ear to these words Jesus of Nazareth a man who had the approval of God as was made clear to you by the great works and signs and wonders which God did by him among you as you yourselves have knowledge
Act  Him when he was given up by the decision and knowledge of God you put to death on the cross by the hands of evil men
Act  But God gave him back to life having made him free from the pains of death because it was not possible for him to be overcome by it
Act  For David said of him I saw the Lord before my face at all times for he is at my right hand so that I may not be moved
Act  And for this cause my heart was glad and my tongue full of joy and my flesh will be resting in hope
Act  For you will not let my soul be in hell and you will not give up your Holy One to destruction
Act  You have made me see the ways of life I will be full of joy when I see your face
Act  My brothers I may say to you openly that David came to his death and was put in the earth and his restingplace is with us today
Act  But being a prophet and having in mind the oath which God had given to him that of the fruit of his body one would take his place as a king
Act  He having knowledge of the future was talking of the coming again of Christ from the dead that he was not kept in hell and his body did not see destruction
Act  This Jesus God has given back to life of which we all are witnesses
Act  And so being lifted up to the right hand of God and having the Fathers word that the Holy Spirit would come he has sent this thing which now you see and have knowledge of
Act  For David has not gone up into heaven but says himself The Lord said to my Lord Be seated at my right hand
Act  Till I put all those who are against you under your feet
Act  For this reason let all Israel be certain that this Jesus whom you put to death on the cross God has made Lord and Christ
Act  Now when these words came to their ears their hearts were troubled and they said to Peter and the other Apostles Brothers what are we to do
Act  And Peter said Let your hearts be changed every one of you and have baptism in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins and you will have the Holy Spirit given to you
Act  For the word of God is for you and for your children and for all those who are far off even all those who may be marked out by the Lord our God
Act  And with more such words he gave his witness offering them salvation and saying Come out from this evil generation
Act  Then those who gave hearing to his words had baptism and about three thousand souls were joined to them that day
Act  And they kept their attention fixed on the Apostles teaching and were united together in the taking of broken bread and in prayer
Act  But fear came on every soul and all sorts of wonders and signs were done by the Apostles
Act  And all those who were of the faith kept together and had all things in common
Act  And exchanging their goods and property for money they made division of it among them all as they had need
Act  And day by day going in agreement together regularly to the Temple and taking broken bread together in their houses they took their food with joy and with true hearts
Act  Giving praise to God and having the approval of all the people and every day the number of those who had salvation was increased by the Lord
Act  Now Peter and John were going up to the Temple at the ninth hour the hour of prayer
Act  And a certain man who from birth had had no power in his legs was taken there every day and put down at the door of the Temple which is named Beautiful requesting money from those who went into the Temple
Act  He then seeing Peter and John going into the Temple made a request to them
Act  And Peter looking at him with John said Keep your eyes on us
Act  And he gave attention to them hoping to get something from them
Act  But Peter said I have no silver or gold but what I have that I give to you In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth get up on your feet
Act  And he took him by his right hand lifting him up and straight away his feet and the bones of his legs became strong
Act  And jumping up he got on to his feet and went into the Temple with them walking and jumping and giving praise to God
Act  And all the people saw him walking and praising God
Act  And they saw that it was the man who made requests for money at the door of the Temple and they were full of wonder and surprise at what had taken place
Act  And while he kept his hands on Peter and John all the people came running together to the covered way which is named Solomons full of wonder
Act  And when Peter saw it he said to the people You men of Israel why are you so greatly surprised at this man or why are you looking at us as if by our power or virtue we had given him the use of his legs
Act  The God of Abraham of Isaac and of Jacob the God of our fathers has given glory to his servant Jesus whom you gave up turning your backs on him when Pilate had made the decision to let him go free
Act  But you would have nothing to do with the Holy and Upright One and made request for a man of blood to be given to you
Act  And put to death the Lord of life whom God gave back from the dead of which fact we are witnesses
Act  And his name through faith in his name has made this man strong whom you see and have knowledge of yes the faith which is through him has made him well before you all
Act  And now my brothers I am conscious that you did this as did your rulers without knowledge
Act  But the things which God had made clear before by the mouth of all the prophets that the Christ would have to undergo he has put into effect in this way
Act  So then let your hearts be changed and be turned to God so that your sins may be completely taken away and times of blessing may come from the Lord
Act  And that he may send the Christ who was marked out for you from the first even Jesus
Act  Who is to be kept in heaven till the time when all things are put right of which God has given word by the mouth of his holy prophets who have been from the earliest times
Act  For Moses said The Lord will give you a prophet from among your people like me you will give ear to everything which he will say to you
Act  And every soul who does not give attention to that prophet will be cut off from among the people
Act  And all the prophets from Samuel and those who came after every one of them gave word of these days
Act  You are the sons of the prophets and of the agreement which God made with your fathers saying to Abraham Through your seed a blessing will come on all the families of the earth
Act  To you first God sent his servant blessing you by turning every one of you from his sins
Act  And while they were talking to the people the priests and the captain of the Temple and the Sadducees came up to them
Act  Being greatly troubled because they were teaching the people and preaching Jesus as an example of the coming back from the dead
Act  And they took them and put them in prison till the morning for it was now evening
Act  But a number of those who gave hearing to the word had faith and they were now about five thousand
Act  And on the day after the rulers and those in authority and the scribes came together in Jerusalem
Act  And Annas the high priest was there and Caiaphas and John and Alexander and all the relations of the high priest
Act  Then sending for Peter and John they said By what power and in whose name have you done this
Act  Then Peter being full of the Holy Spirit said to them O you rulers of the people and men of authority
Act  If we are questioned today about a good work done to a man who was ill as to how he has been made well
Act  Take note all of you and all the people of Israel that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you put to death on the cross whom God gave back from the dead even through him is this man now before you completely well
Act  He is the stone which you builders had no use for but which has been made the chief stone of the building
Act  And in no other is there salvation for there is no other name under heaven given among men through which we may have salvation
Act  Now when they saw that Peter and John were without fear though they were men of no education or learning they were greatly surprised and they took note of them that they had been with Jesus
Act  And seeing that the man who had been made well was there with them they were not able to say anything against it
Act  But when they had given them orders to go out of the Sanhedrin they had a discussion among themselves
Act  Saying What are we to do with these men for certainly it is clear to all who are living in Jerusalem that a most important sign has been done by them and it is not possible to say that it is not so
Act  But so that it may not go farther among the people let us put them in fear of punishment if they say anything in future in this name
Act  And they sent for them and gave them orders not to make statements or give teaching in the name of Jesus
Act  But Peter and John in answer said to them It is for you to say if it is right in the eyes of God to give attention to you more than to God
Act  For it is not possible for us to keep from saying what we have seen and have knowledge of
Act  And when they had said more sharp words to them they let them go not seeing what punishment they might give them because of the people for all men were giving praise to God for what had taken place
Act  For the man on whom this act of power was done was more than forty years old
Act  And when they had been made free they came back to their friends and gave an account of all the things which the chief priests and the authorities had said to them
Act  And hearing it they all with one mind made prayer to God and said O Lord maker of heaven and earth and the sea and all things in them
Act  Who has said by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of our father David your servant Why are the nations so violently moved and why are the thoughts of the people so foolish
Act  The kings of the earth were lifted up the rulers came together against the Lord and against his Christ
Act  For truly in this town against your holy servant Jesus who was marked out by you as Christ Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the people of Israel came together
Act  To do that which had been fixed before by your hand and your purpose
Act  And now Lord take note of their cruel words and give your servants power to be preachers of your word without fear
Act  While your hand is stretched out to do works of mercy so that signs and wonders may be done through the name of your holy servant Jesus
Act  And when their prayer was ended the place where they were was violently moved and they all became full of the Holy Spirit preaching the word of God without fear
Act  And all those who were of the faith were one in heart and soul and not one of them said that any of the things which he had was his property only but they had all things in common
Act  And with great power the Apostles gave witness of the coming back of the Lord Jesus from the dead and grace was on them all
Act  And no one among them was in need for everyone who had land or houses exchanging them for money took the price of them
Act  And put it at the feet of the Apostles for distribution to everyone as he had need
Act  And Joseph who was given by the Apostles the name of Barnabas the sense of which is Son of comfort a Levite and a man of Cyprus by birth
Act  Having a field got money for it and put the money at the feet of the Apostles
Act  But a certain man named Ananias with Sapphira his wife got money for his property
Act  And kept back part of the price his wife having knowledge of it and took the rest and put it at the feet of the Apostles
Act  But Peter said Ananias why has the Evil One put it into your heart to be false to the Holy Spirit and to keep back part of the price of the land
Act  While you had it was it not your property and after you had given it in exchange was it not still in your power how has this purpose come into your mind you have been false not to men but to God
Act  And at these words Ananias went down on the earth and his life went from him and great fear came on all who were present
Act  And the young men went and made ready his body and took it out and put it in the earth
Act  And about three hours after his wife having no knowledge of what had taken place came in
Act  And Peter said to her Give me an answer was this amount of money the price of the land And she said Yes it was
Act  But Peter said to her Why have you made an agreement together to be false to the Spirit of the Lord See the feet of the young men who have put the body of your husband in the earth are at the door and they will take you out
Act  And straight away she went down at his feet and her life went from her and the young men came in and saw her dead and they took her out and put her in the earth with her husband
Act  Then great fear came on all the church and on all who had knowledge of these things
Act  Now a number of signs and wonders were done among the people by the hands of the Apostles and they were all together in Solomons covered way
Act  The others in fear kept back from joining them but the people made much of them
Act  And a great number of men and women had faith and were joined to the Lord
Act  And they even took into the streets people who were ill and put them on beds so that when Peter went by some of them might be in his shade
Act  And numbers of people came together from the towns round about Jerusalem with those who were ill and those who were troubled with unclean spirits and they were all made well
Act  But the high priest and those who were with him the Sadducees were full of envy
Act  And they took the Apostles and put them in the common prison
Act  But in the night an angel of the Lord opening the doors of the prison took them out and said
Act  Go take your place in the Temple and give the people all the teaching about this Life
Act  And hearing this they went into the Temple at dawn and were teaching But the high priest and those who were with him got together the Sanhedrin and the representatives of the children of Israel and sent to the prison to get them
Act  But the men who were sent saw that they were not in the prison and came back with the news
Act  Saying The doors of the prison were safely shut and the keepers were at the doors but when they were open there was nobody inside
Act  Now at these words the captain of the Temple and the chief priests were greatly troubled about what might be the end of this business
Act  And someone came and said to them The men whom you put in prison are in the Temple teaching the people
Act  Then the captain and some of the police went and took them but not violently for fear that they might be stoned by the people
Act  And they took them into the Sanhedrin and the high priest said to them
Act  We gave you very clear orders not to give teaching in this name and now Jerusalem is full of your teaching and you are attempting to make us responsible for this mans death
Act  But Peter and the Apostles answering said We have to do the orders of God not of man
Act  The God of our fathers gave Jesus back to life whom you had put to death hanging him on a tree
Act  Him God has put on high at his right hand as a Ruler and a Saviour to give to Israel a change of heart and forgiveness of sins
Act  And we are witnesses of these things and so is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who keep his laws
Act  But when these words came to their ears they were cut to the heart and had a mind to put them to death
Act  But one of the Sanhedrin a Pharisee named Gamaliel a man of learning in the law of whom all the people had a high opinion got up and made a suggestion for the men to be put outside for a little time
Act  And he said to them Men of Israel take care what you do about these men
Act  For before this there was Theudas who said he was someone important to whom about four hundred men gave their support he was put to death and his band was broken up and came to nothing
Act  After this man there was Judas of Galilee at the time of the numbering and some of the people went after him he was put to death and all his supporters were put to flight
Act  And now I say to you Do nothing to these men but let them be for if this teaching or this work is of men it will come to nothing
Act  But if it is of God you will not be able to overcome them and you are in danger of fighting against God
Act  And he seemed to them to be right and they sent for the Apostles and after having them whipped and giving them orders to give no teaching in the name of Jesus they let them go
Act  So they went away from the Sanhedrin happy to undergo shame for the Name
Act  And every day in the Temple and privately they went on teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ
Act  Now in those days when the number of the disciples was increasing protests were made by the Greek Jews against the Hebrews because their widows were not taken care of in the distribution of food every day
Act  And the Apostles sent for all the disciples and said It is not right for us to give up preaching the word of God in order to make distribution of food
Act  Take then from among you seven men of good name full of the Spirit and of wisdom to whom we may give control of this business
Act  Then we will give all our time to prayer and the teaching of the word
Act  And this saying was pleasing to all of them and they made selection of Stephen a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolas of Antioch who had become a Jew
Act  These they took to the Apostles who after prayer put their hands on them
Act  And the word of God was increasing in power and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem became very great and a great number of priests were in agreement with the faith
Act  And Stephen full of grace and power did great wonders and signs among the people
Act  But some of those who were of the Synagogue named that of the Libertines and some of the men of Cyrene and of Alexandria and those from Cilicia and Asia had arguments with Stephen
Act  But they were not able to get the better of him for his words were full of wisdom and of the Spirit
Act  Then they got men to say He has said evil against Moses and against God in our hearing
Act  And the people with the rulers and the scribes were moved against him and they came and took him before the Sanhedrin
Act  And they got false witnesses who said This man is for ever saying things against this holy place and against the law
Act  For he has said in our hearing that this Jesus of Nazareth will put this place to destruction and make changes in the rules which were handed down to us by Moses
Act  And all those who were in the Sanhedrin looking at him saw that his face was like the face of an angel
Act  Then the high priest said Are these things true
Act  And he said My brothers and fathers give hearing The God of glory came to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia before he was living in Haran
Act  And said to him Go out of your land and away from your family and come into the land to which I will be your guide
Act  Then he came out of the land of the Chaldaeans and went into Haran and from there when his father was dead he was guided by God into this land where you are living now
Act  And God gave him no heritage in it not even enough to put his foot on but he gave him an undertaking that he would give it to him and to his children after him though he had no child at that time
Act  And God said that his seed would be living in a strange land and that they would make them servants and be cruel to them for four hundred years
Act  And I will be the judge said God of that nation which made them servants and after that they will come out and give me worship in this place
Act  And he made with him the agreement of which circumcision was the sign And so Abraham had a son Isaac and gave him circumcision on the eighth day and Isaac had a son Jacob and Jacob was the father of the twelve heads of the families of Israel
Act  And the brothers moved with envy against Joseph gave him to the Egyptians for money but God was with him
Act  And made him free from all his troubles and gave him wisdom and the approval of Pharaoh king of Egypt who made him ruler over Egypt and all his house
Act  Now there was no food to be had in all Egypt and Canaan and there was great trouble and our fathers were not able to get food
Act  But Jacob hearing that there was grain in Egypt sent out our fathers the first time
Act  And the second time his brothers had a meeting with Joseph and Pharaoh had knowledge of Josephs family
Act  Then Joseph sent for Jacob his father and all his family seventyfive persons
Act  And Jacob went down to Egypt and came to his end there and so did our fathers
Act  And they were taken over to Shechem and put to rest in the place which Abraham got for a price in silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem
Act  But when the time was near for putting into effect the undertaking which God had given to Abraham the people were increasing in Egypt
Act  Till another king came to power who had no knowledge of Joseph
Act  He having evil designs against our nation was cruel to our fathers and they were forced to put out their young children so that they might not go on living
Act  At which time Moses came to birth and he was very beautiful and he was kept for three months in his fathers house
Act  And when he was put out Pharaohs daughter took him and kept him as her son
Act  And Moses was trained in all the wisdom of Egypt and was great in his words and works
Act  But when he was almost forty years old it came into his heart to go and see his brothers the children of Israel
Act  And seeing one of them being attacked he went to his help and gave the Egyptian a deathblow
Act  And he was hoping that his brothers would see that God had sent him to be their saviour but they did not see
Act  And the day after he came to them while they were having a fight and would have made peace between them saying Sirs you are brothers why do you do wrong to one another
Act  But the man who was doing wrong to his neighbour pushing him away said Who made you a ruler and a judge over us
Act  Will you put me to death as you did the Egyptian yesterday
Act  And at these words Moses went in flight to the land of Midian and was living there for a time and had two sons
Act  At the end of forty years an angel came to him in the waste land of Sinai in the flame of a burning thorntree
Act  And Moses seeing it was full of wonder and when he came up to have a nearer view of it the voice of the Lord came to him saying
Act  I am the God of your fathers the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob And Moses shaking with fear kept his eyes from looking at it
Act  And the Lord said Take off the shoes from your feet for the place where you are is holy
Act  Truly I have seen the sorrows of my people in Egypt and their cries have come to my ears and I have come down to make them free and now come I will send you to Egypt
Act  This Moses whom they would not have saying Who made you a ruler and a judge him God sent to be a ruler and a saviour by the hand of the angel whom he saw in the thorntree
Act  This man took them out having done wonders and signs in Egypt and in the Red Sea and in the waste land for forty years
Act  This is the same Moses who said to the children of Israel God will give you a prophet from among your brothers like me
Act  This is the man who was in the church in the waste land with the angel who was talking to him in Sinai and with our fathers and to him were given the living words of God so that he might give them to you
Act  By whom our fathers would not be controlled but they put him on one side turning back in their hearts to Egypt
Act  And saying to Aaron Make us gods to go before us as for this Moses who took us out of the land of Egypt we have no idea what has become of him
Act  And they made the image of a young ox in those days and made an offering to it and had joy in the work of their hands
Act  But God was turned from them and let them give worship to the stars of heaven as it says in the book of the prophets Did you make offerings to me of sheep and oxen for forty years in the waste land O house of Israel
Act  And you took up the tent of Moloch and the star of the god Rephan images which you made to give worship to them and I will take you away farther than Babylon
Act  Our fathers had the Tent of witness in the waste land as God gave orders to Moses to make it after the design which he had seen
Act  Which our fathers in their turn took with them when with Joshua they came into the heritage of the nations whom God was driving out before the face of our fathers till the time of David
Act  Who was pleasing to God and he had a desire to make a holy tent for the God of Jacob
Act  But Solomon was the builder of his house
Act  But still the Most High has not his restingplace in houses made with hands as the prophet says
Act  Heaven is the seat of my power and earth is a restingplace for my feet what sort of house will you make for me says the Lord or what is my place of rest
Act  Did not my hand make all these things
Act  You whose hearts are hard and whose ears are shut to me you are ever working against the Holy Spirit as your fathers did so do you
Act  Which of the prophets was not cruelly attacked by your fathers and they put to death those who gave them the news of the coming of the Upright One whom you have now given up and put to death
Act  You to whom the law was given as it was ordered by angels and who have not kept it
Act  Hearing these things they were cut to the heart and moved with wrath against him
Act  But he was full of the Holy Spirit and looking up to heaven he saw the glory of God and Jesus at the right hand of God
Act  And he said Now I see heaven open and the Son of man at the right hand of God
Act  But with loud cries and stopping their ears they made an attack on him all together
Act  Driving him out of the town and stoning him and the witnesses put their clothing at the feet of a young man named Saul
Act  And Stephen while he was being stoned made prayer to God saying Lord Jesus take my spirit
Act  And going down on his knees he said in a loud voice Lord do not make them responsible for this sin And when he had said this he went to his rest
Act  And Saul gave approval to his death Now at that time a violent attack was started against the church in Jerusalem and all but the Apostles went away into all parts of Judaea and Samaria
Act  And Godfearing men put Stephens body in its last restingplace making great weeping over him
Act  But Saul was burning with hate against the church going into every house and taking men and women and putting them in prison
Act  But those who had gone in flight went everywhere preaching the word
Act  And Philip went down to Samaria and was teaching them about Christ
Act  And all the people gave attention to the words which Philip said when they saw the signs which he did
Act  For unclean spirits came out from those who had them crying with a loud voice and a number of those who were ill and broken in body were made well
Act  And there was much joy in that town
Act  But there was a certain man named Simon who in the past had been a wonderworker and a cause of surprise to the people of Samaria saying that he himself was a great man
Act  To whom they all gave attention from the smallest to the greatest saying This man is that power of God which is named Great
Act  And they gave attention to him because for a long time his wonderworking powers had kept them under his control
Act  But when they had faith in the good news given by Philip about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ a number of men and women had baptism
Act  And Simon himself had faith and having had baptism he went with Philip and seeing the signs and the great wonders which he did he was full of surprise
Act  Now when the Apostles at Jerusalem had news that the people of Samaria had taken the word of God into their hearts they sent to them Peter and John
Act  Who when they came there made prayer for them that the Holy Spirit might be given to them
Act  For up to that time he had not come on any of them only baptism had been given to them in the name of the Lord Jesus
Act  Then they put their hands on them and the Holy Spirit came on them
Act  Now when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the touch of the Apostles hands he made them an offering of money saying
Act  Give me this power so that when I put my hands on anyone he may get the Holy Spirit
Act  But Peter said May your money come to destruction with you because you had the idea that what is freely given by God may be got for a price
Act  You have no part in this business because your heart is not right before God
Act  Let your heart be changed and make prayer to God that you may have forgiveness for your evil thoughts
Act  For I see that you are prisoned in bitter envy and the chains of sin
Act  And Simon answering said Make prayer for me to the Lord so that these things which you have said may not come on me
Act  So they having given their witness and made clear the word of the Lord went back to Jerusalem giving the good news on their way in a number of the small towns of Samaria
Act  But an angel of the Lord said to Philip Get up and go to the south to the road which goes from Jerusalem to Gaza through the waste land
Act  And he went and there was a man of Ethiopia a servant of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians and controller of all her property who had come up to Jerusalem for worship
Act  He was going back seated in his carriage and was reading the book of the prophet Isaiah
Act  And the Spirit said to Philip Go near and get on his carriage
Act  And Philip running up to him saw that he was reading Isaiah the prophet and said to him Is the sense of what you are reading clear to you
Act  And he said How is that possible when I have no guide And he made Philip get up by his side
Act  Now the place in the book where he was reading was this He was taken like a sheep to be put to death and as a lamb is quiet when its wool is being cut so he made no sound
Act  Being of low degree his cause was not given a hearing who has knowledge of his family for his life is cut off from the earth
Act  And the Ethiopian said to Philip About whom are these words said by the prophet about himself or some other
Act  So Philip starting from this writing gave him the good news about Jesus
Act  And while they were going on their way they came to some water and the Ethiopian said See here is water why may I not have baptism
Act  
Act  And he gave orders for the carriage to be stopped and the two of them went down into the water and Philip gave him baptism
Act  And when they came up out of the water the Spirit of the Lord took Philip away and the Ethiopian saw him no more for he went on his way full of joy
Act  But Philip came to Azotus and went through all the towns preaching the good news till he came to Caesarea
Act  But Saul still burning with desire to put to death the disciples of the Lord went to the high priest
Act  And made a request for letters from him to the Synagogues of Damascus so that if there were any of the Way there men or women he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem
Act  And while he was journeying he came near Damascus and suddenly he saw a light from heaven shining round him
Act  And he went down on the earth and a voice said to him Saul Saul why are you attacking me so cruelly
Act  And he said Who are you Lord And he said I am Jesus whom you are attacking
Act  But get up and go into the town and it will be made clear to you what you have to do
Act  And the men who were with him were not able to say anything hearing the voice but seeing no one
Act  And Saul got up from the earth and when his eyes were open he saw nothing and he was guided by the hand into Damascus
Act  And for three days he was not able to see and he took no food or drink
Act  Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias and the Lord said to him in a vision Ananias and he said Here I am Lord
Act  And the Lord said to him Get up and go to the street which is named Straight and make search at the house of Judas for one named Saul of Tarsus for he is at prayer
Act  And he has seen a man named Ananias coming in and putting his hands on him so that he may be able to see
Act  But Ananias said Lord I have had accounts of this man from a number of people how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem
Act  And here he has authority from the chief priests to make prisoners all who give worship to your name
Act  But the Lord said Go without fear for he is a special vessel for me to give to the Gentiles and kings and to the children of Israel the knowledge of my name
Act  For I will make clear to him what troubles he will have to undergo for me
Act  And Ananias went out and came to the house and putting his hands on him said Brother Saul the Lord Jesus whom you saw when you were on your journey has sent me so that you may be able to see and be full of the Holy Spirit
Act  And straight away it seemed as if a veil was taken from his eyes and he was able to see and he got up and had baptism
Act  And when he had taken food his strength came back And for some days he kept with the disciples who were in Damascus
Act  And straight away in the Synagogues he was preaching Jesus as the Son of God
Act  And all those hearing him were full of wonder and said Is not this the man who in Jerusalem was attacking all the worshippers of this name and he had come here so that he might take them as prisoners before the chief priests
Act  But Saul went on increasing in power and the Jews in Damascus were not able to give answers to the arguments by which he made it clear that Jesus was the Christ
Act  Then after some days the Jews made an agreement together to put him to death
Act  But Saul got knowledge of their design And they kept watch day and night on the roads out of the town so that they might put him to death
Act  But his disciples took him by night and let him down from the wall in a basket
Act  And when he came to Jerusalem he made an attempt to be joined to the disciples but they were all in fear of him not taking him for a disciple
Act  But Barnabas took him to the Apostles and gave them an account of how he had seen the Lord on the road and had given hearing to his words and how at Damascus he had been preaching in the name of Jesus without fear
Act  And he was with them going in and out at Jerusalem
Act  Preaching in the name of the Lord without fear and he had discussions with the Greek Jews but they were working for his death
Act  And when the brothers had knowledge of it they took him to Caesarea and sent him to Tarsus
Act  And so the church through all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and was made strong and living in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit was increased greatly
Act  And it came about that while Peter was going through all parts of the country he came to the saints who were living at Lydda
Act  And there was a certain man there named Aeneas who for eight years had been in bed without power of moving
Act  And Peter said to him Aeneas Jesus Christ makes you well get up and make your bed And straight away he got up
Act  And all those living in Lydda and Sharon saw him and were turned to the Lord
Act  Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha that is Dorcas this woman was given to good works and acts of mercy at all times
Act  And it came about in those days that she got ill and came to her death and when she had been washed they put her in a room which was high up
Act  And because Lydda was near Joppa the disciples having knowledge that Peter was there sent two men to him requesting him to come to them straight away
Act  And Peter went with them And when he had come they took him into the room and all the widows were there weeping and putting before him the coats and clothing which Dorcas had made while she was with them
Act  But Peter made them all go outside and went down on his knees in prayer and turning to the body he said Tabitha get up And opening her eyes she saw Peter and got up
Act  And he took her hand lifting her up and sending for the saints and widows he gave her to them living
Act  And news of it went all through Joppa and a number of people had faith in the Lord
Act  And he was living in Joppa for some time with Simon a leatherworker
Act  Now there was a certain man in Caesarea named Cornelius the captain of the Italian band of the army
Act  A seriousminded man fearing God with all his family he gave much money to the poor and made prayer to God at all times
Act  He saw in a vision clearly at about the ninth hour of the day an angel of the Lord coming to him and saying to him Cornelius
Act  And he looking on him in fear said What is it Lord And he said to him Your prayers and your offerings have come up to God and he has kept them in mind
Act  Now send men to Joppa and get one Simon named Peter
Act  Who is living with Simon a leatherworker whose house is by the sea
Act  And when the angel who said these words to him had gone away he sent for two of his houseservants and a Godfearing man of the army one of those who were waiting on him at all times
Act  And having given them an account of everything he sent them to Joppa
Act  Now the day after when they were on their journey and were near the town Peter went up to the top of the house for prayer about the sixth hour
Act  And he was in need of food but while they were getting it ready a deep sleep came on him
Act  And he saw the heavens opening and a vessel coming down like a great cloth let down on the earth
Act  In which were all sorts of beasts and birds
Act  And a voice came to him saying Come Peter take them for food
Act  But Peter said No Lord for I have never taken food which is common or unclean
Act  And the voice came to him a second time What God has made clean do not you make common
Act  And this was done three times and then the vessel was taken back into heaven
Act  Now while Peter was in doubt as to the purpose of this vision the men who were sent by Cornelius having made search for Simons house came to the door
Act  To see if Simon named Peter was living there
Act  And while Peter was turning the vision over in his mind the Spirit said to him See three men are looking for you
Act  Go down then and go with them doubting nothing for I have sent them
Act  And Peter went down to the men and said I am the man you are looking for why have you come
Act  And they said Cornelius a captain an upright and Godfearing man respected by all the nation of the Jews had word from God by an angel to send for you to his house and to give hearing to your words
Act  So he took them in for the night And the day after he went with them taking some of the brothers from Joppa with him
Act  And the day after that they came to Caesarea And Cornelius was waiting for them having got together his relations and his near friends
Act  And when Peter came in Cornelius came to him and falling down at his feet gave him worship
Act  But Peter lifting him up said Get up for I am a man as you are
Act  And saying these words he went in and saw that a great number of people had come together
Act  And he said to them You yourselves have knowledge that it is against the law for a man who is a Jew to be in the company of one who is of another nation but God has made it clear to me that no man may be named common or unclean
Act  And so I came without question when I was sent for What then is your purpose in sending for me
Act  And Cornelius said Four days from now I was in my house in prayer at the ninth hour and I saw before me a man in shining clothing
Act  Who said Cornelius your prayer has come to the ears of God and your offerings are kept in his memory
Act  Send then to Joppa and get Simon named Peter to come to you he is living in the house of Simon a leatherworker by the sea
Act  So straight away I sent for you and you have done well to come And now we are all present before God ready to give attention to all the things which the Lord has given you to say
Act  Then Peter said Truly I see clearly that God is no respecter of persons
Act  But in every nation the man who has fear of him and does righteousness is pleasing to him
Act  The word which he sent to the children of Israel giving the good news of peace through Jesus Christ who is Lord of all
Act  That word you yourselves have knowledge of which was made public through all Judaea starting from Galilee after the baptism of which John was the preacher
Act  About Jesus of Nazareth how God gave the Holy Spirit to him with power and how he went about doing good and making well all who were troubled by evil spirits for God was with him
Act  And we are witnesses of all the things which he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem whom they put to death hanging him on a tree
Act  On the third day God gave him back to life and let him be seen
Act  Not by all the people but by witnesses marked out before by God even by us who took food and drink with him after he came back from the dead
Act  And he gave us orders to give news of this to the people and to give public witness that this is he whom God has made judge of the living and the dead
Act  To him all the prophets give witness that through his name everyone who has faith in him will have forgiveness of sins
Act  While Peter was saying these words the Holy Spirit came on all those who were hearing the word
Act  And the Jews of the faith who had come with Peter were full of wonder because the Holy Spirit was given to the Gentiles
Act  And they were talking in tongues and giving glory to God Then Peter said
Act  Will any man say that these may not have baptism who have been given the Holy Spirit as we have
Act  And he gave orders for them to have baptism in the name of Jesus Christ Then they kept him with them for some days
Act  Now the Apostles and the brothers who were in Judaea had news that the word of God had been given to the Gentiles
Act  And when Peter came to Jerusalem those who kept the rule of circumcision had an argument with him
Act  Saying You went to men without circumcision and took food with them
Act  But Peter gave them an account of it all in order saying to them
Act  I was in the town of Joppa at prayer and falling into a deep sleep I saw in a vision a vessel like a great cloth let down from heaven and it came down to me
Act  And looking on it with attention I saw in it all sorts of beasts and birds
Act  And a voice came to my ears saying Come Peter take them for food
Act  But I said No Lord for nothing common or unclean has ever come into my mouth
Act  But the voice coming a second time from heaven said What God has made clean do not you make common
Act  And this was done three times and they were all taken up again into heaven
Act  And at that minute three men sent from Caesarea came to the house where we were
Act  And the Spirit gave me orders to go with them doubting nothing And these six brothers came with me and we went into that mans house
Act  And he gave us an account of how he had seen the angel in his house saying Send to Joppa and get Simon named Peter to come to you
Act  Who will say words to you through which you and all your family may get salvation
Act  And while I was talking to them the Holy Spirit came on them as on us at first
Act  And the words of the Lord came into my mind how he said The baptism of John was with water but you will have baptism with the Holy Spirit
Act  If then God gave them when they had faith in the Lord Jesus Christ the same as he gave to us who was I to go against God
Act  And hearing these things they said nothing more but gave glory to God saying Then to the Gentiles as to us has God given a change of heart so that they may have life
Act  Then those who had gone away at the time of the trouble about Stephen went as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus preaching to the Jews only
Act  But some of them men of Cyprus and Cyrene when they came to Antioch gave the good news about the Lord Jesus to the Greeks
Act  And the power of the Lord was with them and a great number had faith and were turned to the Lord
Act  And news of them came to the ears of the church at Jerusalem and they sent Barnabas as far as Antioch
Act  Who when he came and saw the grace of God was glad and he made clear to them the need of keeping near the Lord with all the strength of their hearts
Act  For he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith and a great number were joined to the Lord
Act  Then he went on to Tarsus looking for Saul
Act  And when he had come across him he took him to Antioch And they were with the church there for a year teaching the people and the disciples were first given the name of Christians in Antioch
Act  Now in those days prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch
Act  And one of them named Agabus said publicly through the Spirit that there would be serious need of food all over the earth which came about in the time of Claudius
Act  And the disciples everyone as he was able made a decision to send help to the brothers living in Judaea
Act  Which they did sending it to the rulers of the church by the hand of Barnabas and Saul
Act  Now about that time Herod the king made cruel attacks on the Christians
Act  And he put James the brother of John to death with the sword
Act  And when he saw that this was pleasing to the Jews he went on to take Peter in addition This was at the time of the feast of unleavened bread
Act  And having taken him he put him in prison with four bands of armed men to keep watch over him his purpose being to take him out to the people after the Passover
Act  So Peter was kept in prison but the church made strong prayer to God for him
Act  And when Herod was about to take him out the same night Peter was sleeping in chains between two armed men and the watchmen were keeping watch before the door of the prison
Act  And a great light was seen shining in the room and an angel of the Lord came to Peter and touching him on his side so that he came out of his sleep said Get up quickly And his chains came off his hands
Act  Then the angel said Put on your shoes and get ready to go And he did so And he said Put your coat round you and come with me
Act  And he went out after him and he was not certain if what was done by the angel was a fact for it seemed to him that he was seeing a vision
Act  And when they had gone past the first and second watchmen they came to the iron door into the town which came open by itself and they went out and down one street and then the angel went away
Act  And when Peter came to his senses he said Now truly I am certain that the Lord has sent his angel and taken me out of the hands of Herod against all the hopes of the Jews
Act  And when he became clear about this he went to the house of Mary the mother of John named Mark where a number of them had come together for prayer
Act  And he gave a blow on the door and a young girl came to it named Rhoda
Act  And hearing the voice of Peter in her joy she went running without opening the door to say that Peter was outside
Act  And they said to her You are off your head But still she said with decision that it was so And they said It is his angel
Act  But Peter went on giving blows on the door and when it was open and they saw him they were full of wonder
Act  But he made a sign to them with his hand to be quiet and gave them an account of how the Lord had taken him out of prison And he said Give the news to James and the brothers And then he went away
Act  Now when it was day the armed men were greatly troubled about what had become of Peter
Act  And Herod when he sent for him and he was not there after questioning the watchmen gave orders that they were to be put to death Then he went down from Judaea to Caesarea for a time
Act  Now he was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon and they came to him all together and having made friends with Blastus the controller of the kings house they made a request for peace because their country was dependent on the kings country for its food
Act  And on the day which had been fixed Herod dressed in his robes and seated in his place made a public statement to them
Act  And the people with loud cries said It is the voice of a god not of a man
Act  And straight away the angel of the Lord sent a disease on him because he did not give the glory to God and his flesh was wasted away by worms and so he came to his end
Act  But the word of the Lord went on increasing
Act  And Barnabas and Saul came back from Jerusalem when their work was ended taking with them John named Mark
Act  Now there were at Antioch in the church there prophets and teachers Barnabas and Symeon who was named Niger and Lucius of Cyrene and Manaen a relation of Herod the king and Saul
Act  And while they were doing the Lords work and going without food the Holy Spirit said Let Barnabas and Saul be given to me for the special work for which they have been marked out by me
Act  Then after prayer and going without food they put their hands on them and sent them away
Act  So being sent out by the Holy Spirit they went down to Seleucia and from there they went by ship to Cyprus
Act  And at Salamis they were preaching the word of God in the Synagogues of the Jews and John was with them helping them
Act  And when they had gone through all the island to Paphos they came across a certain wonderworker and false prophet a Jew whose name was BarJesus
Act  Who was with the ruler Sergius Paulus an able man This man sent for Barnabas and Saul desiring to have knowledge of the word of God
Act  But Elymas the wonderworker for that is the sense of his name put himself against them with the purpose of turning the ruler from the faith
Act  But Saul whose other name is Paul being full of the Holy Spirit looking hard at him said
Act  O you who are full of false tricks and evil ways a son of the Evil One hating all righteousness will you for ever be turning people from the right ways of the Lord
Act  And now see the hand of the Lord is on you and you will be blind and not able to see the sun for a time And straight away a dark mist came down on him and he went about looking for a guide
Act  Then the ruler when he saw what was done had faith being full of wonder at the teaching of the Lord
Act  Then Paul and those who were with him went by ship from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia and there John went away from them and came back to Jerusalem
Act  But they going through from Perga came to Antioch in Pisidia and they went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath and were seated
Act  And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the Synagogue sent to them saying Brothers if you have a word of comfort for the people say on
Act  And Paul getting up and making a sign with his hand said Men of Israel and you who have the fear of God give ear
Act  The God of this people Israel made selection of our fathers lifting the people up from their low condition when they were living in the land of Egypt and with a strong arm took them out of it
Act  And for about forty years he put up with their ways in the waste land
Act  And having put to destruction seven nations in the land of Canaan he gave them the land for their heritage for about four hundred and fifty years
Act  And after these things he gave them judges till the time of Samuel the prophet
Act  Then at their request for a king God gave them Saul the son of Kish a man of the family of Benjamin who was their king for forty years
Act  And having put him on one side he made David their king to whom he gave witness saying I have taken David the son of Jesse a man dear to my heart who will do all my pleasure
Act  From this mans seed has God given to Israel a Saviour even Jesus as he gave his word
Act  For whose coming John made ready the way by preaching to all the people of Israel the baptism which goes with a change of heart
Act  And when John was completing his work he said What do I seem to you to be I am not he but one is coming after me whose shoes I am not good enough to undo
Act  My brothers children of the family of Abraham and those among you who have the fear of God to us the word of this salvation is sent
Act  For the men of Jerusalem and their rulers having no knowledge of him or of the sayings of the prophets which come to their ears every Sabbath day gave effect to them by judging him
Act  And though no cause of death was seen in him they made a request to Pilate that he might be put to death
Act  And when they had done all the things said in the Writings about him they took him down from the tree and put him in the place of the dead
Act  But God gave him back from the dead
Act  And for a number of days he was seen by those who came with him from Galilee to Jerusalem who are now his witnesses before the people
Act  And we are giving you the good news of the undertaking made to the fathers
Act  Which God has now put into effect for our children by sending Jesus as it says in the second Psalm You are my Son this day I have given you being
Act  And about his coming back from the dead never again to go to destruction he has said these words I will give you the holy and certain mercies of David
Act  Because he says in another Psalm You will not let your Holy One see destruction
Act  Now David having done Gods work for his generation went to sleep and was put with his fathers and his body came to destruction
Act  But he who was lifted up by God did not see destruction
Act  And so let it be clear to you my brothers that through this man forgiveness of sins is offered to you
Act  And through him everyone who has faith is made free from all those things from which the law of Moses was not able to make you free
Act  So take care that these words of the prophets do not come true for you
Act  See you doubters have wonder and come to your end for I will do a thing in your days to which you will not give belief even if it is made clear to you
Act  And when they went out they made a request that these words might be said to them again on the Sabbath after
Act  Now when the meeting was ended a number of the Jews and of the Godfearing Gentiles who had become Jews went after Paul and Barnabas who put before them how important it was to keep on in the grace of God
Act  And on the Sabbath after almost all the town came together to give hearing to the word of God
Act  But when the Jews saw such a great number of people they were full of envy and said evil words against Pauls preaching
Act  Then Paul and Barnabas without fear said It was necessary for the word of God to be given to you first but because you will have nothing to do with it and have no desire for eternal life it will now be offered to the Gentiles
Act  For so the Lord has given us orders saying I have given you for a light to the Gentiles so that you may be for salvation to the ends of the earth
Act  And the Gentiles hearing this were glad and gave glory to the word of God and those marked out by God for eternal life had faith
Act  And the word of the Lord went through all the country
Act  But the Jews working up the feelings of the Godfearing women of high position and of the chief men of the town got an attack started against Paul and Barnabas driving them out of those parts
Act  But they shaking off the dust of that place from their feet came to Iconium
Act  And the disciples were full of joy and of the Holy Spirit
Act  Now in Iconium they went together to the Synagogue of the Jews and gave such teaching that a great number of Jews and Greeks had faith
Act  But those Jews who had not the faith made the minds of the Gentiles bitter against the brothers
Act  So they kept there for a long time taking heart in the Lord who gave witness to the word of his grace by causing signs and wonders to be done by their hands
Act  But there was a division among the people of the town some were on the side of the Jews and some on the side of the Apostles
Act  And when a violent attempt was made by the Gentiles and the Jews with their rulers to make an attack on them and have them stoned
Act  Having got news of it they went in flight to the towns of Lycaonia Lystra and Derbe and the country round about
Act  And went on preaching the good news there
Act  And at Lystra there was a certain man who from birth had been without the use of his feet never having had the power of walking
Act  This man was giving ear to the preaching of Paul who looking at him and seeing that he had faith to be made well
Act  Said in a loud voice Get up on your feet And jumping up he went walking about
Act  And when the people saw what Paul had done they said in a loud voice in the language of Lycaonia The gods have come down to us in the form of men
Act  And they gave the name of Jupiter to Barnabas and to Paul that of Mercury because he was the chief talker
Act  And the priest of the image of Jupiter which was before the town took oxen and flowers to the doors of the town and was about to make an offering with the people
Act  But when this came to the ears of the Apostles Paul and Barnabas they went running out among the people parting their clothing and crying out
Act  Good people why are you doing these things We are men with the same feelings as you and we give you the good news so that you may be turned away from these foolish things to the living God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all things in them
Act  Who in the past let all nations go in the ways which seemed good to them
Act  But he was not without witness because he did good and gave you rain from heaven and times of fruit making your hearts full of food and joy
Act  And even with these words it was hard for them to keep the people from making an offering to them
Act  But some Jews came to that place from Antioch and Iconium and got control over the people and after stoning Paul they had him pulled out of the town taking him for dead
Act  But when the disciples came round him he got up and went into the town and the day after he went away with Barnabas to Derbe
Act  And having made a number of disciples through the preaching of the good news in that town they went back to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch
Act  Making strong the souls of the disciples saying to them that they were to keep the faith and that we have to go through troubles of all sorts to come into the kingdom of God
Act  And when they had made selection of some to be rulers in every church and had given themselves to prayer and kept themselves from food they put them into the care of the Lord in whom they had faith
Act  And they went through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia
Act  And after preaching the word in Perga they went down to Attalia
Act  And from there they went by ship to Antioch where they had been handed over to the grace of God for the work which they had not done
Act  And when they came there and had got the church together they gave them an account of all the things which God had done through them and how he had made open a door of faith to the Gentiles
Act  And they were with the disciples there for a long time
Act  Now certain men came down from Judaea teaching the brothers and saying that without circumcision after the rule of Moses there is no salvation
Act  And after Paul and Barnabas had had no little argument and discussion with them the brothers made a decision to send Paul and Barnabas and certain others of them to the Apostles and the rulers of the church at Jerusalem about this question
Act  So they being sent on their way by the church went through Phoenicia and Samaria giving news of the salvation of the Gentiles to the great joy of all the brothers
Act  And when they came to Jerusalem they had a meeting with the church and the Apostles and the rulers and they gave an account of all the things which God had done through them
Act  But some of the Pharisees who were of the faith got up and said It is necessary for these to have circumcision and to keep the law of Moses
Act  And the Apostles and the rulers of the church came together and gave thought to the question
Act  And when there had been much discussion Peter got up and said to them My brothers you have knowledge that some time back it was Gods pleasure that by my mouth the good news might be given to the Gentiles so that they might have faith
Act  And God the searcher of hearts was a witness to them giving them the Holy Spirit even as he did to us
Act  Making no division between them and us but making clean their hearts by faith
Act  Why then are you testing God by putting on the neck of the disciples a yoke so hard that not even our fathers or we were strong enough for it
Act  But we have faith that we will get salvation through the grace of the Lord Jesus in the same way as they
Act  And all the people were quiet while Barnabas and Paul gave an account of the signs and wonders which God had done among the Gentiles by them
Act  And when they had come to an end James answering said My brothers give ear to me
Act  Symeon has given an account of how God was first pleased to take from among the Gentiles a people for himself
Act  And this is in agreement with the words of the prophets as it is said
Act  After these things I will come back and will put up the tent of David which has been broken down building up again its broken parts and making it complete
Act  So that the rest of men may make search for the Lord and all the Gentiles on whom my name is named
Act  Says the Lord who has made these things clear from the earliest times
Act  For this reason my decision is that we do not put trouble in the way of those who from among the Gentiles are turned to God
Act  But that we give them orders to keep themselves from things offered to false gods and from the evil desires of the body and from the flesh of animals put to death in ways against the law and from blood
Act  For Moses from times long past has his preachers in every town reading his law in the Synagogues every Sabbath
Act  Then it seemed good to the Apostles and the rulers and all the church to send men from among them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas Judas named Barsabbas and Silas chief men among the brothers
Act  And they sent a letter by them saying The Apostles and the older brothers to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia may joy be with you
Act  Because we have knowledge that some who went from us have been troubling you with their words putting your souls in doubt to whom we gave no such order
Act  It seemed good to us having come to an agreement together to send these men to you with our well loved Barnabas and Paul
Act  Men who have given up their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
Act  And so we have sent Judas and Silas who will say the same things to you themselves by word of mouth
Act  For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to put on you nothing more than these necessary things
Act  To keep from things offered to false gods and from blood and from things put to death in ways which are against the law and from the evil desires of the body if you keep yourselves from these you will do well May you be happy
Act  So they being sent away came down to Antioch and having got the people together they gave them the letter
Act  And after reading it they were glad of its comfort
Act  And Judas and Silas who themselves were prophets gave teaching to the brothers and made them strong in the faith
Act  And when they had been there for some time they were sent back in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them
Act  
Act  But Paul and Barnabas kept on in Antioch teaching and preaching the word of God with a number of others
Act  And after some days Paul said to Barnabas Let us go back and see the brothers in every town where we have given the word of God and see how they are
Act  And Barnabas had a desire to take with them John named Mark
Act  But Paul was of the opinion that it was not right to take with them one who had gone away from them in Pamphylia and had not gone on with the work
Act  And there was a sharp argument between them so that they were parted from one another and Barnabas took Mark with him and went by ship to Cyprus
Act  But Paul took Silas and went away with the blessing of the brothers
Act  And he went through Syria and Cilicia making the churches stronger in the faith
Act  And he came to Derbe and Lystra and there was a certain disciple there named Timothy whose mother was one of the Jews of the faith but his father was a Greek
Act  Of whom the brothers at Lystra and Iconium had a high opinion
Act  Paul had a desire for him to go with him and he gave him circumcision because of the Jews who were in those parts for they all had knowledge that his father was a Greek
Act  And on their way through the towns they gave them the rules which had been made by the Apostles and the rulers of the church at Jerusalem so that they might keep them
Act  So the churches were made strong in the faith and were increased in number every day
Act  And after they had gone through the land of Phrygia and Galatia the Holy Spirit did not let them take the word into Asia
Act  And having come to Mysia they made an attempt to go into Bithynia but the Spirit of Jesus did not let them
Act  And going past Mysia they came down to Troas
Act  And Paul had a vision in the night a man of Macedonia came requesting him and saying Come over into Macedonia and give us help
Act  And when he had seen the vision straight away we made the decision to go into Macedonia for it seemed certain to us that God had sent us to give the good news to them
Act  So from Troas we went straight by ship to Samothrace and the day after to Neapolis
Act  And from there to Philippi which is the most important town of Macedonia and a Roman colony and we were there for some days
Act  And on the Sabbath we went outside the town by the river where we had an idea that there would be a place of prayer and being seated we had talk with the women who had come together
Act  And a certain woman named Lydia a trader in purple cloth of the town of Thyatira and a Godfearing woman gave ear to us whose heart the Lord made open to give attention to the things which Paul was saying
Act  And when she and her family had had baptism she made a request to us saying If it seems to you that I am true to the Lord come into my house and be my guests And she made us come
Act  And when we were going to the place of prayer we came across a girl with a spirit which gave knowledge of the future whose masters made great profit from her power
Act  She came after Paul and us crying out and saying These men are the servants of the Most High God who are giving you news of the way of salvation
Act  And this she did on a number of days But Paul was greatly troubled and turning said to the spirit I give you orders in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her And it came out that very hour
Act  But when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone they took Paul and Silas pulling them into the marketplace before the rulers
Act  And when they had taken them before the authorities they said These men who are Jews are greatly troubling our town
Act  Teaching rules of living which it is not right for us to have or to keep being Romans
Act  And the people made an attack on them all together and the authorities took their clothing off them and gave orders for them to be whipped
Act  And when they had given them a great number of blows they put them in prison giving orders to the keeper of the prison to keep them safely
Act  And he having such orders put them into the inner prison with chains on their feet
Act  But about the middle of the night Paul and Silas were making prayers and songs to God in the hearing of the prisoners
Act  And suddenly there was an earthshock so that the base of the prison was moved and all the doors came open and everyones chains came off
Act  And the keeper coming out of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open took his sword and was about to put himself to death fearing that the prisoners had got away
Act  But Paul said in a loud voice Do yourself no damage for we are all here
Act  And he sent for lights and came rushing in and shaking with fear went down on his face before Paul and Silas
Act  And took them out and said Sirs what have I to do to get salvation
Act  And they said Have faith in the Lord Jesus and you and your family will have salvation
Act  And they gave the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house
Act  And that same hour of the night he took them and when he had given attention to their wounds he and all his family had baptism straight away
Act  And he took them into his house and gave them food and he was full of joy having faith in God with all his family
Act  But when it was day the authorities sent the police saying Let these men go
Act  And the keeper said to Paul The authorities have given orders to let you go come out now and go in peace
Act  But Paul said to them They have given us who are Romans a public whipping without judging us and have put us in prison Will they now send us out secretly no truly let them come themselves and take us out
Act  And the police gave an account of these words to the authorities and they were full of fear on hearing that they were Romans
Act  Then they came and made prayers to them requesting them when they had taken them out to go away from the town
Act  And they came out of the prison and went to the house of Lydia and when they had seen the brothers they gave them comfort and went away
Act  Now when they had gone through Amphipolis and Apollonia they came to Thessalonica where there was a Synagogue of the Jews
Act  And Paul as he generally did went in to them and on three Sabbath days had discussions with them from the holy Writings
Act  Saying to them clearly and openly that Christ had to be put to death and come back to life again and that this Jesus whom he said I am preaching to you is the Christ
Act  And some of them had faith and were joined to Paul and Silas and a number of the Godfearing Greeks and some of the chief women
Act  But the Jews being moved with envy took with them certain low persons from among the common people and getting together a great number of people made an outcry in the town attacking the house of Jason with the purpose of taking them out to the people
Act  And when they were not able to get them they took Jason and some of the brothers by force before the rulers of the town crying These men who have made trouble all over the world have now come here
Act  Whom Jason has taken into his house and they are acting against the orders of Caesar saying that there is another king Jesus
Act  And hearing these things the people and the rulers of the town were troubled
Act  And having made Jason and the others give an undertaking to keep the peace they let them go
Act  And the brothers straight away sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea and they when they came there went to the Synagogue of the Jews
Act  Now these were more noble than the Jews of Thessalonica for they gave serious attention to the word searching in the holy Writings every day to see if these things were so
Act  And a number of them had faith and no small number of the Greek women of high position and of the men
Act  But when the Jews of Thessalonica had news that Paul was preaching the word at Beroea they came there troubling the people and working them up
Act  So the brothers sent Paul straight away to the sea but Silas and Timothy kept there still
Act  But those who went with Paul took him as far as Athens and then went away with orders from him to Silas and Timothy to come to him quickly
Act  Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens his spirit was troubled for he saw all the town full of images of the gods
Act  So he had discussions in the Synagogue with the Jews and Godfearing Gentiles and every day in the marketplace with those who were there
Act  And some of those who were supporters of the theories of the Epicureans and the Stoics had a meeting with him And some said What is this talker of foolish words saying And others He seems to be a preacher of strange gods because he was preaching of Jesus and his coming back from the dead
Act  And they took him to Mars Hill saying Will you make clear to us what is this new teaching of yours
Act  For you seem to us to say strange things and we have a desire to get the sense of them
Act  Now all the Athenians and the men from other lands who come there were giving all their time to talking or hearing of anything new
Act  And Paul got to his feet on Mars Hill and said O men of Athens I see that you are overmuch given to fear of the gods
Act  For when I came by I was looking at the things to which you give worship and I saw an altar with this writing on it TO THE GOD OF WHOM THERE IS NO KNOWLEDGE Now what you without knowledge give worship to I make clear to you
Act  The God who made the earth and everything in it he being Lord of heaven and earth is not housed in buildings made with hands
Act  And he is not dependent on the work of mens hands as if he had need of anything for he himself gives to all life and breath and all things
Act  And he has made of one blood all the nations of men living on all the face of the earth ordering their times and the limits of their lands
Act  So that they might make search for God in order if possible to get knowledge of him and make discovery of him though he is not far from every one of us
Act  For in him we have life and motion and existence as certain of your verse writers have said For we are his offspring
Act  If then we are the offspring of God it is not right for us to have the idea that God is like gold or silver or stone formed by the art or design of man
Act  Those times when men had no knowledge were overlooked by God but now he gives orders to all men in every place to undergo a change of heart
Act  Because a day has been fixed in which all the world will be judged in righteousness by the man who has been marked out by him for this work of which he has given a sign to all men by giving him back from the dead
Act  Now on hearing about the coming back from death some of them made sport of it but others said Let us go more fully into this another time
Act  And so Paul went away from among them
Act  But some men gave him their support among whom was Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them
Act  After these things he went away from Athens and came to Corinth
Act  And there he came across a certain Jew named Aquila a man of Pontus by birth who not long before had come from Italy with his wife Priscilla because Claudius had given orders that all Jews were to go away from Rome and he came to them
Act  And because he was of the same trade he was living with them and they did their work together for by trade they were tentmakers
Act  And every Sabbath he had discussions in the Synagogue turning Jews and Greeks to the faith
Act  And when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia Paul was completely given up to the word preaching to the Jews that the Christ was Jesus
Act  And when they put themselves against him and said evil words he said shaking his clothing Your blood be on your heads I am clean from now I will go to the Gentiles
Act  And moving from there he went into the house of a man named Titus Justus a Godfearing man whose house was very near the Synagogue
Act  And Crispus the ruler of the Synagogue with all his family had faith in the Lord and a great number of the people of Corinth hearing the word had faith and were given baptism
Act  And the Lord said to Paul in the night in a vision Have no fear and go on preaching
Act  For I am with you and no one will make an attack on you to do you damage for I have a number of people in this town
Act  And he was there for a year and six months teaching the word of God among them
Act  But when Gallio was ruler of Achaia all the Jews together made an attack on Paul and took him to the judges seat
Act  Saying This man is teaching the people to give worship to God in a way which is against the law
Act  But when Paul was about to say something Gallio said to the Jews If this was anything to do with wrongdoing or crime there would be a reason for me to give you a hearing
Act  But if it is a question of words or names or of your law see to it yourselves I will not be a judge of such things
Act  And he sent them away from the judges seat
Act  And they all made an attack on Sosthenes the ruler of the Synagogue and gave him blows before the judges seat but Gallio gave no attention to these things
Act  And Paul after waiting some days went away from the brothers and went by ship to Syria Priscilla and Aquila being with him and he had had his hair cut off in Cenchrea for he had taken an oath
Act  And they came down to Ephesus and he left them there and he himself went into the Synagogue and had a discussion with the Jews
Act  And being requested by them to be there for a longer time he said No
Act  And went from them saying I will come back to you if God lets me and he took ship from Ephesus
Act  And when he had come to land at Caesarea he went to see the church and then went down to Antioch
Act  And having been there for some time he went through the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order making the disciples strong in the faith
Act  Now a certain Jew named Apollos an Alexandrian by birth and a man of learning came to Ephesus and he had great knowledge of the holy Writings
Act  This man had been trained in the way of the Lord and burning in spirit he gave himself up to teaching the facts about Jesus though he had knowledge only of Johns baptism
Act  And he was preaching in the Synagogue without fear But Priscilla and Aquila hearing his words took him in and gave him fuller teaching about the way of God
Act  And when he had a desire to go over into Achaia the brothers gave him help and sent letters to the disciples requesting them to take him in among them and when he had come he gave much help to those who had faith through grace
Act  For he overcame the Jews in public discussion making clear from the holy Writings that the Christ was Jesus
Act  And it came about that while Apollos was at Corinth Paul having gone through the higher country came to Ephesus where there were certain disciples
Act  And he said to them Did you get the Holy Spirit when you had faith And they said to him No we have had no knowledge of the Holy Spirit
Act  And he said What sort of baptism did you have And they said The baptism of John
Act  And Paul said John gave a baptism which goes with a change of heart saying to the people that they were to have faith in him who was coming after him that is in Jesus
Act  And hearing this they had baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
Act  And when Paul had put his hands on them the Holy Spirit came on them and they had the power of talking in tongues and acting like prophets
Act  And there were about twelve of these men
Act  And he went into the Synagogue and for three months he was preaching there without fear reasoning and teaching about the kingdom of God
Act  But because some of the people were hardhearted and would not give hearing saying evil words about the Way before the people he went away from them and kept the disciples separate reasoning every day in the school of Tyrannus
Act  And this went on for two years so that all those who were living in Asia had knowledge of the word of the Lord Greeks as well as Jews
Act  And God did special works of power by the hands of Paul
Act  So that bits of linen and clothing from his body were taken to people who were ill and their diseases went away from them and the evil spirits went out
Act  But some of the Jews who went from place to place driving out evil spirits took it on themselves to make use of the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits saying I give you orders by Jesus whom Paul is preaching
Act  And there were seven sons of a man named Sceva a Jew and a chief priest who did this
Act  And the evil spirit answering said to them I have knowledge of Jesus and of Paul but who are you
Act  And the man in whom the evil spirit was jumping on them was stronger than the two of them and overcame them so that they went running from that house wounded and without their clothing
Act  And this came to the ears of all those Jews and Greeks who were living at Ephesus and fear came on them all and the name of the Lord Jesus was made great
Act  And a number of those who had faith came and made a public statement of their sins and all their acts
Act  And a great number of those who were experts in strange arts took their books and put them on the fire in front of everyone and when the books were valued they came to fifty thousand bits of silver
Act  So the word of the Lord was increased very greatly and was full of power
Act  Now after these things were ended Paul came to a decision that when he had gone through Macedonia and Achaia he would go to Jerusalem saying After I have been there I have a desire to see Rome
Act  And having sent two of his helpers Timothy and Erastus into Macedonia he himself went on living in Asia for a time
Act  And about that time a great outcry took place about the Way
Act  For there was a certain man named Demetrius a silverworker who made silver boxes for the images of Diana and gave no small profit to the workmen
Act  Whom he got together with other workmen of the same trade and said to them Men it is clear that from this business we get our wealth
Act  And you see for it has come to your ears that not only at Ephesus but almost all through Asia this Paul has been teaching numbers of people and turning them away saying that those are not gods who are made by mens hands
Act  And there is danger not only that our trade may be damaged in the opinion of men but that the holy place of the great goddess Diana may be no longer honoured and that she to whom all Asia and the world give worship will be put down from her high position
Act  And hearing this they were very angry crying out and saying Great is Diana of Ephesus
Act  And the town was full of noise and trouble and they all came running into the theatre having taken by force Gaius and Aristarchus men of Macedonia who were journeying in company with Paul
Act  And when Paul was about to go in to the people the disciples did not let him
Act  And some of the rulers of Asia being his friends sent to him requesting him seriously not to put himself in danger by going into the theatre
Act  And some said one thing and some another for there was no order in the meeting and most of them had no idea why they had come together
Act  Then they took Alexander out from among the people the Jews putting him forward And Alexander making a sign with his hand was about to make a statement to the people in answer
Act  But when they saw that he was a Jew all of them with one voice went on crying out for about two hours Great is Diana of Ephesus
Act  And when the chief secretary had got the people quiet he said Men of Ephesus is any man without knowledge that the town of Ephesus is the keeper of the holy place of the great Diana who was sent down from Jupiter
Act  So then because these things may not be doubted it would be better for you to be quiet and do nothing unwise
Act  For you have taken these men who are not doing damage to the holy place or talking against our goddess
Act  If then Demetrius and the workmen who are with him have a protest to make against any man the law is open to them and there are judges let them put up a cause at law against one another
Act  But if any other business is in question let it be taken up in the regular meeting
Act  For truly we are in danger of being made responsible for this days trouble there being no cause for it and we are not able to give any reason for this coming together
Act  And when he had said this he sent the meeting away
Act  And after the noise had come to an end Paul having sent for the disciples and given them comfort went away from them to Macedonia
Act  And when he had gone through those parts and given them much teaching he came into Greece
Act  And when he had been there three months because the Jews had made a secret design against him when he was about to take ship for Syria he made a decision to go back through Macedonia
Act  And Sopater of Beroea the son of Pyrrhus and Aristarchus and Secundus of Thessalonica and Gaius of Derbe and Timothy and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia went with him as far as Asia
Act  But these had gone before and were waiting for us at Troas
Act  And we went away from Philippi by ship after the days of unleavened bread and came to them at Troas in five days and we were there for seven days
Act  And on the first day of the week when we had come together for the holy meal Paul gave them a talk for it was his purpose to go away on the day after and he went on talking till after the middle of the night
Act  And there were a number of lights in the room where we had come together
Act  And a certain young man named Eutychus who was seated in the window went into a deep sleep and while Paul went on talking being overcome by sleep he had a fall from the third floor and was taken up dead
Act  And Paul went down and falling on him took him in his arms and said Do not be troubled for his life is in him
Act  And when he had gone up and had taken the broken bread he went on talking to them for a long time even till dawn and then he went away
Act  And they took the boy in living and were greatly comforted
Act  But we going before him by ship went to Assos with the purpose of taking Paul in there for so he had given orders because he himself was coming by land
Act  And when he came up with us at Assos we took him in the ship and went on to Mitylene
Act  And going from there by sea we came on the day after opposite Chios and touching at Samos on the day after that we came on the third day to Miletus
Act  For Pauls purpose was to go past Ephesus so that he might not be kept in Asia for he was going quickly in order if possible to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost
Act  And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus for the rulers of the church
Act  And when they had come he said to them You yourselves have seen what my life has been like all the time from the day when I first came into Asia
Act  Doing the Lords work without pride through all the sorrow and troubles which came on me because of the evil designs of the Jews
Act  And how I kept back nothing which might be of profit to you teaching you publicly and privately
Act  Preaching to Jews and to Greeks the need for a turning of the heart to God and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ
Act  And now as you see I am going to Jerusalem a prisoner in spirit having no knowledge of what will come to me there
Act  Only that the Holy Spirit makes clear to me in every town that prison and pains are waiting for me
Act  But I put no value on my life if only at the end of it I may see the work complete which was given to me by the Lord Jesus to be a witness of the good news of the grace of God
Act  And now I am conscious that you among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom will not see my face again
Act  And so I say to you this day that I am clean from the blood of all men
Act  For I have not kept back from you anything of the purpose of God
Act  Give attention to yourselves and to all the flock which the Holy Spirit has given into your care to give food to the church of God for which he gave his blood
Act  I am conscious that after I am gone evil wolves will come in among you doing damage to the flock
Act  And from among yourselves will come men who will give wrong teaching turning away the disciples after them
Act  So keep watch having in mind that for three years without resting I was teaching every one of you day and night with weeping
Act  And now I give you into the care of God and the word of his grace which is able to make you strong and to give you your heritage among all the saints
Act  I have had no desire for any mans silver or gold or clothing
Act  You yourselves have seen that with these hands I got what was necessary for me and those who were with me
Act  In all things I was an example to you of how in your lives you are to give help to the feeble and keep in memory the words of the Lord Jesus how he himself said There is a greater blessing in giving than in getting
Act  And having said these words he went down on his knees in prayer with them all
Act  And they were all weeping falling on Pauls neck and kissing him
Act  Being sad most of all because he had said that they would not see his face again And so they went with him to the ship
Act  And after parting from them we put out to sea and came straight to Cos and the day after to Rhodes and from there to Patara
Act  And as there was a ship going to Phoenicia we went in it
Act  And when we had come in view of Cyprus going past it on our left we went on to Syria and came to land at Tyre for there the goods which were in the ship had to be taken out
Act  And meeting the disciples we were there for seven days and they gave Paul orders through the Spirit not to go up to Jerusalem
Act  And when these days came to an end we went on our journey and they all with their wives and children came with us on our way till we were out of the town and after going on our knees in prayer by the sea
Act  We said our last words to one another and got into the ship and they went back to their houses
Act  And journeying by ship from Tyre we came to Ptolemais and there we had talk with the brothers and were with them for one day
Act  And on the day after we went away and came to Caesarea where we were guests in the house of Philip the preacher who was one of the seven
Act  And he had four daughters virgins who were prophets
Act  And while we were waiting there for some days a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Judaea
Act  And he came to us and took the band of Pauls clothing and putting it round his feet and hands said The Holy Spirit says these words So will the Jews do to the man who is the owner of this band and they will give him up into the hands of the Gentiles
Act  And hearing these things we and those who were living in that place made request to him not to go to Jerusalem
Act  Then Paul said What are you doing weeping and wounding my heart for I am ready not only to be a prisoner but to be put to death at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus
Act  And as he might not be moved we did no more saying Let the purpose of God be done
Act  And after these days we got ready and went up to Jerusalem
Act  And some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us taking a certain Mnason of Cyprus one of the early disciples in whose house we were to be living
Act  And when we came to Jerusalem the brothers were pleased to see us
Act  And on the day after Paul went with us to James and all the rulers of the church were present
Act  And when he had said how glad he was to see them he gave them a detailed account of the things which God had done through his work among the Gentiles
Act  And hearing it they gave praise to God and they said to him You see brother what thousands there are among the Jews who have the faith and they all have a great respect for the law
Act  And they have had news of you how you have been teaching all the Jews among the Gentiles to give up the law of Moses and not to give circumcision to their children and not to keep the old rules
Act  What then is the position They will certainly get news that you have come
Act  Do this then which we say to you We have four men who have taken an oath
Act  Go with these and make yourself clean with them and make the necessary payments for them so that they may be free from their oath and everyone will see that the statements made about you are not true but that you put yourself under rule and keep the law
Act  But as to the Gentiles who have the faith we sent a letter giving our decision that they were to keep themselves from offerings made to false gods and from blood and from the flesh of animals put to death in ways against the law and from the evil desires of the body
Act  Then Paul took the men and on the day after making himself clean with them he went into the Temple giving out the statement that the days necessary for making them clean were complete till the offering was made for every one of them
Act  And when the seven days were almost ended the Jews from Asia seeing him in the Temple got the people together and put their hands on him
Act  Crying out Men of Israel come to our help this is the man who is teaching all men everywhere against the people and the law and this place and in addition he has taken Greeks into the Temple and made this holy place unclean
Act  For they had seen him before in the town with Trophimus of Ephesus and had the idea that Paul had taken him with him into the Temple
Act  And all the town was moved and the people came running together and put their hands on Paul pulling him out of the Temple and then the doors were shut
Act  And while they were attempting to put him to death news came to the chief captain of the band that all Jerusalem was out of control
Act  And straight away he took some armed men and went quickly down to them and the Jews seeing them gave no more blows to Paul
Act  Then the chief captain came near and took him and gave orders for him to be put in chains questioning them as to who he was and what he had done
Act  And some said one thing and some another among the people and as he was not able to get a knowledge of the facts because of the noise he gave orders for Paul to be taken into the army building
Act  And when he came on to the steps he was lifted up by the armed men because of the force of the people
Act  For a great mass of people came after them crying out Away with him
Act  And when Paul was about to be taken into the building he said to the chief captain May I say something to you And he said Have you a knowledge of Greek
Act  Are you by chance the Egyptian who before this got the people worked up against the government and took four thousand men of the Assassins out into the waste land
Act  But Paul said I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia which is not an unimportant town I make a request to you to let me say a word to the people
Act  And when he let him do so Paul from the steps made a sign with his hand to the people and when they were all quiet he said to them in the Hebrew language
Act  My brothers and fathers give ear to the story of my life which I now put before you
Act  And hearing him talking in the Hebrew language they became the more quiet and he said
Act  I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia by birth but I had my education in this town at the feet of Gamaliel being trained in the keeping of every detail of the law of our fathers given up to the cause of God with all my heart as you are today
Act  And I made attacks on this Way even to death taking men and women and putting them in prison
Act  Of which the high priest will be a witness and all the rulers from whom I had letters to the brothers and I went into Damascus to take those who were there as prisoners to Jerusalem for punishment
Act  And it came about that while I was on my journey coming near to Damascus about the middle of the day suddenly I saw a great light from heaven shining round me
Act  And when I went down on the earth a voice came to my ears saying to me Saul Saul why are you attacking me so cruelly
Act  And I answering said Who are you Lord And he said to me I am Jesus of Nazareth whom you are attacking
Act  And those who were with me saw the light but the voice of him who was talking to me came not to their ears
Act  And I said What have I to do Lord And the Lord said to me Get up and go into Damascus and it will be made clear to you what you have to do
Act  And because I was unable to see because of the glory of that light those who were with me took me by the hand and so I came to Damascus
Act  And one Ananias a Godfearing man who kept the law and of whom all the Jews in that place had a high opinion
Act  Came to my side and said Brother Saul let your eyes be open And in that very hour I was able to see him
Act  And he said You have been marked out by the God of our fathers to have knowledge of his purpose and to see the Upright One and to give ear to the words of his mouth
Act  For you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and of what has come to your ears
Act  And now why are you waiting get up and have baptism for the washing away of your sins giving worship to his name
Act  And it came about that when I had come back to Jerusalem while I was at prayer in the Temple my senses became more than naturally clear
Act  And I saw him saying to me Go out of Jerusalem straight away because they will not give hearing to your witness about me
Act  And I said Lord they themselves have knowledge that I went through the Synagogues putting in prison and whipping all those who had faith in you
Act  And when Stephen your witness was put to death I was there giving approval and looking after the clothing of those who put him to death
Act  And he said to me Go for I will send you far away to the Gentiles
Act  And they gave him a hearing as far as this word then with loud voices they said Away with this man from the earth it is not right for him to be living
Act  And while they were crying out and pulling off their clothing and sending dust into the air
Act  The chief captain gave orders for him to be taken into the army building saying that he would put him to the test by whipping so that he might have knowledge of the reason why they were crying out so violently against him
Act  And when they had put leather bands round him Paul said to the captain who was present Is it the law for you to give blows to a man who is a Roman and has not been judged
Act  And hearing this the man went to the chief captain and gave him an account of it saying What are you about to do for this man is a Roman
Act  And the chief captain came to him and said Give me an answer are you a Roman And he said Yes
Act  And the chief captain said I got Roman rights for myself at a great price And Paul said But I had them by birth
Act  Then those who were about to put him to the test went away and the chief captain was in fear seeing that he was a Roman and that he had put chains on him
Act  But on the day after desiring to have certain knowledge of what the Jews had to say against him he made him free and gave orders for the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin to come together and he took Paul and put him before them
Act  And Paul looking fixedly at the Sanhedrin said My brothers my life has been upright before God till this day
Act  And the high priest Ananias gave orders to those who were near him to give him a blow on the mouth
Act  Then Paul said to him God will give blows to you you whitewashed wall are you here to be my judge by law and by your orders am I given blows against the law
Act  And those who were near said Do you say such words against Gods high priest
Act  And Paul said Brother I had no idea that he was the high priest for it has been said You may not say evil about the ruler of your people
Act  But when Paul saw that half of them were Sadducees and the rest Pharisees he said in the Sanhedrin Brothers I am a Pharisee and the son of Pharisees I am here to be judged on the question of the hope of the coming back from the dead
Act  And when he had said this there was an argument between the Pharisees and the Sadducees and a division in the meeting
Act  For the Sadducees say that there is no coming back from the dead and no angels or spirits but the Pharisees have belief in all these
Act  And there was a great outcry and some of the scribes on the side of the Pharisees got up and took part in the discussion saying We see no evil in this man what if he has had a revelation from an angel or a spirit
Act  And when the argument became very violent the chief captain fearing that Paul would be pulled in two by them gave orders to the armed men to take him by force from among them and take him into the army building
Act  And the night after the Lord came to his side and said Be of good heart for as you have been witnessing for me in Jerusalem so will you be my witness in Rome
Act  And when it was day the Jews came together and put themselves under an oath that they would take no food or drink till they had put Paul to death
Act  And more than forty of them took this oath
Act  And they came to the chief priests and the rulers and said We have taken a great oath to take no food till we have put Paul to death
Act  So now will you and the Sanhedrin make a request to the military authorities to have him sent down to you as if you were desiring to go into the business in greater detail and we before ever he gets to you will be waiting to put him to death
Act  But Pauls sisters son had word of their design and he came into the army building and gave news of it to Paul
Act  And Paul sent for a captain and said Take this young man to your chief for he has news for him
Act  So he took him to the chief captain and said Paul the prisoner made a request to me to take this young man to you for he has something to say to you
Act  And the chief took him by the hand and going on one side said to him privately What is it you have to say to me
Act  And he said The Jews are in agreement together to make a request to you for Paul to be taken on the day after this into the Sanhedrin to be questioned in greater detail
Act  But do not give way to them for more than forty of them are waiting for him having taken an oath not to take food or drink till they have put him to death and now they are ready waiting for your order
Act  So the chief captain let the young man go saying to him Do not say to anyone that you have given me word of these things
Act  And he sent for two captains and said Make ready two hundred men with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go to Caesarea at the third hour of the night
Act  And get beasts so that they may put Paul on them and take him safely to Felix the ruler
Act  And he sent a letter in these words
Act  Claudius Lysias to the most noble ruler Felix peace be with you
Act  This man was taken by the Jews and was about to be put to death by them when I came on them with the army and took him out of danger having knowledge that he was a Roman
Act  And desiring to get at the reason for their attack on him I took him down to their Sanhedrin
Act  Then it became clear to me that it was a question of their law and that nothing was said against him which might be a reason for prison or death
Act  And when news was given to me that a secret design was being made against the man I sent him straight away to you giving orders to those who are against him to make their statements before you
Act  So the armed men as they were ordered took Paul and came by night to Antipatris
Act  But on the day after they sent the horsemen on with him and went back to their place
Act  And they when they came to Caesarea gave the letter to the ruler and took Paul before him
Act  And after reading it he said What part of the country do you come from And hearing that he was from Cilicia
Act  I will give hearing to your cause he said when those who are against you have come And he gave orders for him to be kept in Herods Praetorium
Act  And after five days the high priest Ananias came with certain of the rulers and an expert talker one Tertullus and they made a statement to Felix against Paul
Act  And when he had been sent for Tertullus starting his statement said Because by you we are living in peace and through your wisdom wrongs are put right for this nation
Act  In all things and in all places we are conscious of our great debt to you most noble Felix
Act  But so that I may not make you tired I make a request to you of your mercy to give hearing to a short statement
Act  For this man in our opinion is a cause of trouble a maker of attacks on the government among Jews through all the empire and a chief mover in the society of the Nazarenes
Act  Who in addition was attempting to make the Temple unclean whom we took
Act  
Act  And from whom you will be able by questioning him yourself to get knowledge of all the things which we say against him
Act  And the Jews were in agreement with his statement saying that these things were so
Act  Then when the ruler had given him a sign to make his answer Paul said Because I have knowledge that you have been a judge over this nation for a number of years I am glad to make my answer
Act  Seeing that you are able to make certain of the fact that it is not more than twelve days from the time when I came up to Jerusalem for worship
Act  And they have not seen me in argument with any man in the Temple or working up the feelings of the people in the Synagogues or in the town
Act  And they are not able to give facts in support of the things which they say against me now
Act  But this I will say openly to you that I do give worship to the God of our fathers after that Way which to them is not the true religion but I have belief in all the things which are in the law and in the books of the prophets
Act  Hoping in God for that which they themselves are looking for that there will be a coming back from the dead for upright men and wrongdoers
Act  And in this I do my best at all times to have no reason for shame before God or men
Act  Now after a number of years I came to give help and offerings to my nation
Act  And having been made clean I was in the Temple but not with a great number of people and not with noise but there were certain Jews from Asia
Act  And it would have been better if they had come here to make a statement if they have anything against me
Act  Or let these men here present say what wrongdoing was seen in me when I was before the Sanhedrin
Act  But only this one thing which I said among them in a loud voice I am this day being judged on the question of the coming back from the dead
Act  But Felix who had a more detailed knowledge of the Way put them off saying When Lysias the chief captain comes down I will give attention to your business
Act  And he gave orders to the captain to keep Paul under his control and to let him have everything he had need of and not to keep his friends from coming to see him
Act  But after some days Felix came with Drusilla his wife who was of the Jews by birth and sent for Paul and gave hearing to him about faith in Christ Jesus
Act  And while he was talking about righteousness and selfcontrol and the judging which was to come Felix had great fear and said Go away for the present and when the right time comes I will send for you
Act  For he was hoping that Paul would give him money so he sent for him more frequently and had talk with him
Act  But after two years Porcius Festus took the place of Felix who desiring to have the approval of the Jews kept Paul in chains
Act  So Festus having come into that part of the country which was under his rule after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea
Act  And the chief priests and the chief men of the Jews made statements against Paul
Act  Requesting Festus to give effect to their design against him and send him to Jerusalem when they would be waiting to put him to death on the way
Act  But Festus in answer said that Paul was being kept in prison at Caesarea and that in a short time he himself was going there
Act  So he said let those who have authority among you go with me and if there is any wrong in the man let them make a statement against him
Act  And when he had been with them not more than eight or ten days he went down to Caesarea and on the day after he took his place on the judges seat and sent for Paul
Act  And when he came the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem came round him and made all sorts of serious statements against him which were not supported by the facts
Act  Then Paul in his answer to them said I have done no wrong against the law of the Jews or against the Temple or against Caesar
Act  But Festus desiring to get the approval of the Jews said to Paul Will you go up to Jerusalem and be judged before me there in connection with these things
Act  And Paul said I am before the seat of Caesars authority where it is right for me to be judged I have done no wrong to the Jews as you are well able to see
Act  If then I am a wrongdoer and there is a cause of death in me I am ready for death if it is not as they say against me no man may give me up to them Let my cause come before Caesar
Act  Then Festus having had a discussion with the Jews made answer You have said Let my cause come before Caesar to Caesar you will go
Act  Now when some days had gone by King Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea and went to see Festus
Act  And as they were there for some days Festus gave them Pauls story saying There is a certain man here who was put in prison by Felix
Act  Against whom the chief priests and the rulers of the Jews made a statement when I was at Jerusalem requesting me to give a decision against him
Act  To whom I gave answer that it is not the Roman way to give a man up till he has been face to face with those who are attacking him and has had a chance to give an answer to the statements made against him
Act  So when they had come together here straight away on the day after I took my place on the judges seat and sent for the man
Act  But when they got up they said nothing about such crimes as I had in mind
Act  But had certain questions against him in connection with their religion and about one Jesus now dead who Paul said was living
Act  And as I had not enough knowledge for the discussion of these things I made the suggestion to him to go to Jerusalem and be judged there
Act  But when Paul made a request that he might be judged by Caesar I gave orders for him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar
Act  And Agrippa said to Festus I have a desire to give the man a hearing myself Tomorrow he said you may give him a hearing
Act  So on the day after when Agrippa and Bernice in great glory had come into the public place of hearing with the chief of the army and the chief men of the town at the order of Festus Paul was sent for
Act  And Festus said King Agrippa and all those who are present here with us you see this man about whom all the Jews have made protests to me at Jerusalem and in this place saying that it is not right for him to be living any longer
Act  But in my opinion there is no cause of death in him and as he himself has made a request to be judged by Caesar I have said that I would send him
Act  But I have no certain account of him to send to Caesar So I have sent for him to come before you and specially before you King Agrippa so that after the business has been gone into I may have something to put in writing
Act  For it seems to me against reason to send a prisoner without making clear what there is against him
Act  And Agrippa said to Paul You may put your cause before us Then Paul stretching out his hand made his answer saying
Act  In my opinion I am happy King Agrippa to be able to give my answer before you today to all these things which the Jews say against me
Act  The more so because you are expert in all questions to do with the Jews and their ways so I make my request to you to give me a hearing to the end
Act  All the Jews have knowledge of my way of life from my early years as it was from the start among my nation and at Jerusalem
Act  And they are able to say if they would give witness that I was living as a Pharisee in that division of our religion which is most regular in the keeping of the law
Act  And now I am here to be judged because of the hope given by Gods word to our fathers
Act  For the effecting of which our twelve tribes have been working and waiting night and day with all their hearts And in connection with this hope I am attacked by the Jews O king
Act  Why in your opinion is it outside belief for God to make the dead come to life again
Act  For I truly was of the opinion that it was right for me to do a number of things against the name of Jesus of Nazareth
Act  And this I did in Jerusalem and numbers of the saints I put in prison having had authority given to me from the chief priests and when they were put to death I gave my decision against them
Act  And I gave them punishment frequently in all the Synagogues forcing them to say things against God and burning with passion against them I went after them even into faraway towns
Act  Then when I was journeying to Damascus with the authority and orders of the chief priests
Act  In the middle of the day on the road I saw a light from heaven brighter than the sun shining round me and those who were journeying with me
Act  And when we had all gone down on the earth a voice came to me saying in the Hebrew language Saul Saul why are you attacking me so cruelly It is hard for you to go against the impulse which is driving you
Act  And I said Who are you Lord And the Lord said I am Jesus whom you are attacking
Act  But get up on your feet for I have come to you for this purpose to make you a servant and a witness of the things in which you have seen me and of those in which you will see me
Act  And I will keep you safe from the people and from the Gentiles to whom I send you
Act  To make their eyes open turning them from the dark to the light and from the power of Satan to God so that they may have forgiveness of sins and a heritage among those who are made holy by faith in me
Act  So then King Agrippa I did not go against the vision from heaven
Act  But I went about first to those in Damascus and Jerusalem and through all the country of Judaea and then to the Gentiles preaching a change of heart so that they being turned to God might give in their works the fruits of a changed heart
Act  For this reason the Jews took me in the Temple and made an attempt to put me to death
Act  And so by Gods help I am here today witnessing to small and great saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would come about
Act  That the Christ would go through pain and being the first to come back from the dead would give light to the people and to the Gentiles
Act  And when he made his answer in these words Festus said in a loud voice Paul you are off your head your great learning has made you unbalanced
Act  Then Paul said I am not off my head most noble Festus but my words are true and wise
Act  For the king has knowledge of these things to whom I am talking freely being certain that all this is common knowledge to him for it has not been done in secret
Act  King Agrippa have you faith in the prophets I am certain that you have
Act  And Agrippa said to Paul A little more and you will be making me a Christian
Act  And Paul said It is my prayer to God that in little or great measure not only you but all those hearing me today might be even as I am but for these chains
Act  And the king and the ruler and Bernice and those who were seated with them got up
Act  And when they had gone away they said to one another This man has done nothing which might give cause for death or prison
Act  And Agrippa said to Festus This man might have been made free if he had not put his cause before Caesar
Act  And when the decision had been made that we were to go by sea to Italy they gave Paul and certain other prisoners into the care of a captain named Julius of the Augustan band
Act  And we went to sea in a ship of Adramyttium which was sailing to the sea towns of Asia Aristarchus a Macedonian of Thessalonica being with us
Act  And on the day after we came to Sidon and Julius was kind to Paul and let him go to see his friends and take a rest
Act  And sailing again from there we went on under cover of Cyprus because the wind was against us
Act  And having gone across the sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia we came to Myra in Lycia
Act  And there the captain came across a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy and put us in it
Act  And when we had gone on slowly for a long time and had had hard work getting across to Cnidus for the wind was against us we went under cover of Crete in the direction of Salmone
Act  And sailing down the side of it as well as we were able we came to a certain place named Fair Havens near which was the town of Lasea
Act  And as a long time had gone by and the journey was now full of danger because it was late in the year Paul put the position before them
Act  Saying Friends I see that this journey will be one of great damage and loss not only to the goods and the ship but to ourselves
Act  But the captain gave more attention to the master and the owner of the ship than to what Paul said
Act  And as the harbour was not a good one in which to be for the winter the greater number of them were for going out to sea in order if possible to put in for the winter at Phoenix a harbour of Crete looking to the northeast and southeast
Act  And when the south wind came softly being of the opinion that their purpose might be effected they let the ship go and went sailing down the side of Crete very near to the land
Act  But after a little time a very violent wind named Euraquilo came down from it with great force
Act  And when the ship got into the grip of it and was not able to make headway into the wind we gave way and went before it
Act  And sailing near the side of a small island named Cauda we were able though it was hard work to make the ships boat safe
Act  And having got it up they put cords under and round the ship but fearing that they might be pushed on to the Syrtis they let down the sails and so went running before the wind
Act  And still fighting the storm with all our strength the day after they made a start at getting the goods out of the ship
Act  And on the third day they let all the sailing apparatus go over the side
Act  And as we had not seen the sun or stars for a long time and a great storm was on us all hope of salvation was gone
Act  And when they had been without food for a long time Paul got up among them and said Friends it would have been better if you had given attention to me and not gone sailing out from Crete to undergo this damage and loss
Act  But now I say to you be of good heart for there will be no loss of life but only of the ship
Act  For this night there came to my side an angel of the God who is my Master and whose servant I am
Act  Saying Have no fear Paul for you will come before Caesar and God has given to you all those who are sailing with you
Act  And so O men be of good heart for I have faith in God that it will be as he said to me
Act  But we will be sent on to a certain island
Act  But when the fourteenth day came while we were going here and there in the Adriatic sea about the middle of the night the sailors had an idea that they were getting near land
Act  And they let down the lead and saw that the sea was a hundred and twenty feet deep and after a little time they did it again and it was ninety feet
Act  Then fearing that by chance we might come on to the rocks they let down four hooks from the back of the ship and made prayers for the coming of day
Act  Then the sailors made attempts secretly to get away from the ship letting down a boat as if they were about to put down hooks from the front of the ship
Act  But Paul said to the captain and his men If you do not keep these men in the ship you will not be safe
Act  Then the armed men cutting the cords of the boat let her go
Act  And when dawn was near Paul gave them all orders to take food saying This is the fourteenth day you have been waiting and taking no food
Act  So I make request to you to take food for this is for your salvation not a hair from the head of any of you will come to destruction
Act  And when he had said this and had taken bread he gave praise to God before them all and took a meal of the broken bread
Act  Then they all took heart and did the same
Act  And we were in the ship two hundred and seventysix persons
Act  And when they had had enough food they made the weight of the ship less turning the grain out into the sea
Act  And when it was day they had no knowledge of the land but they saw an inlet of the sea with a floor of sand and they had the idea of driving the ship up on to it if possible
Act  So cutting away the hooks and letting them go into the sea and freeing the cords of the guidingblades and lifting up the sail to the wind they went in the direction of the inlet
Act  And coming to a point between two seas they got the ship to land and the front part was fixed in the sand and not able to be moved but the back part was broken by the force of the waves
Act  Then the armed men were for putting the prisoners to death so that no one would get away by swimming
Act  But the captain desiring to keep Paul safe kept them from their purpose and gave orders that those who had knowledge of swimming were to go off the ship and get first to land
Act  And the rest some on boards and some on things from the ship And so it came about that they all got safe to land
Act  And when we were safe we made the discovery that the island was named Melita
Act  And the simple people living there were uncommonly kind to us for they made a fire for us and took us in because it was raining and cold
Act  But when Paul had got some sticks together and put them on the fire a snake came out because of the heat and gave him a bite on the hand
Act  And when the people saw it hanging on his hand they said to one another Without doubt this man has put someone to death and though he has got safely away from the sea God will not let him go on living
Act  But shaking off the beast into the fire he got no damage
Act  But they had the idea that they would see him becoming ill or suddenly falling down dead but after waiting a long time and seeing that no damage came to him changing their opinion they said he was a god
Act  Now near that place there was some land the property of the chief man of the island who was named Publius who very kindly took us into his house as his guests for three days
Act  And the father of Publius was ill with a disease of the stomach to whom Paul went and put his hands on him with prayer and made him well
Act  And when this took place all the others in the island who had diseases came and were made well
Act  Then they gave us great honour and when we went away they put into the ship whatever things we were in need of
Act  And after three months we went to sea in a ship of Alexandria sailing under the sign of the Dioscuri which had been at the island for the winter
Act  And going into the harbour at Syracuse we were waiting there for three days
Act  And from there going about in a curve we came to Rhegium and after one day a south wind came up and on the day after we came to Puteoli
Act  Where we came across some of the brothers who kept us with them for seven days and so we came to Rome
Act  And the brothers when they had news of us came out from town as far as Appii Forum and the Three Taverns to have a meeting with us and Paul seeing them gave praise to God and took heart
Act  And when we came into Rome they let Paul have a house for himself and the armed man who kept watch over him
Act  Then after three days he sent for the chief men of the Jews and when they had come together he said to them My brothers though I had done nothing against the people or the ways of our fathers I was given a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans
Act  Who when they had put questions to me were ready to let me go free because there was no cause of death in me
Act  But when the Jews made protest against it I had to put my cause into Caesars hands not because I have anything to say against my nation
Act  But for this reason I sent for you to see and have talk with you for because of the hope of Israel I am in these chains
Act  And they said to him We have not had letters from Judaea about you and no one of the brothers has come to us here to give an account or say any evil about you
Act  But we have a desire to give hearing to your opinion for as to this form of religion we have knowledge that in all places it is attacked
Act  And when a day had been fixed they came to his house in great numbers and he gave them teaching giving witness to the kingdom of God and having discussions with them about Jesus from the law of Moses and from the prophets from morning till evening
Act  And some were in agreement with what he said but some had doubts
Act  And they went away for there was a division among them after Paul had said this one thing Well did the Holy Spirit say by the prophet Isaiah to your fathers
Act  Go to this people and say Though you give ear you will not get knowledge and seeing you will see but the sense will not be clear to you
Act  For the heart of this people has become fat and their ears are slow in hearing and their eyes are shut for fear that they might see with their eyes and give hearing with their ears and become wise in their hearts and be turned again to me so that I might make them well
Act  Be certain then that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles and they will give hearing
Act  
Act  And for the space of two years Paul was living in the house of which he had the use and had talk with all those who went in to see him
Act  Preaching the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ without fear and no orders were given that he was not to do so
Rom  Paul a servant of Jesus Christ an Apostle by the selection of God given authority as a preacher of the good news
Rom  Of which God had given word before by his prophets in the holy Writings
Rom  About his Son who in the flesh came from the family of David
Rom  But was marked out as Son of God in power by the Holy Spirit through the coming to life again of the dead Jesus Christ our Lord
Rom  Through whom grace has been given to us sending us out to make disciples to the faith among all nations for his name
Rom  Among whom you in the same way have been marked out to be disciples of Jesus Christ
Rom  To all those who are in Rome loved by God marked out as saints Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
Rom  First of all I give praise to my God through Jesus Christ for you all because news of your faith has gone into all the world
Rom  For God is my witness whose servant I am in spirit in the good news of his Son that you are at all times in my memory and in my prayers
Rom  And that I am ever making prayers that God will give me a good journey to you
Rom  For I have a strong desire to see you and to give you some grace of the spirit so that you may be made strong
Rom  That is to say that all of us may be comforted together by the faith which is in you and in me
Rom  You may be certain my brothers that it has frequently been in my mind to come to you but till now I was kept from it so that I might have some fruit from you in the same way as I have had it from the other nations
Rom  I have a debt to Greeks and to the nations outside to the wise and to those who have no learning
Rom  For which reason I have the desire as far as I am able to give the knowledge of the good news to you who are in Rome
Rom  For I have no feeling of shame about the good news because it is the power of God giving salvation to everyone who has faith to the Jew first and then to the Greek
Rom  For in it there is the revelation of the righteousness of God from faith to faith as it is said in the holy Writings The man who does righteousness will be living by his faith
Rom  For there is a revelation of the wrath of God from heaven against all the wrongdoing and evil thoughts of men who keep down what is true by wrongdoing
Rom  Because the knowledge of God may be seen in them God having made it clear to them
Rom  For from the first making of the world those things of God which the eye is unable to see that is his eternal power and existence are fully made clear he having given the knowledge of them through the things which he has made so that men have no reason for wrongdoing
Rom  Because having the knowledge of God they did not give glory to God as God and did not give praise but their minds were full of foolish things and their hearts being without sense were made dark
Rom  Seeming to be wise they were in fact foolish
Rom  And by them the glory of the eternal God was changed and made into the image of man who is not eternal and of birds and beasts and things which go on the earth
Rom  For this reason God gave them up to the evil desires of their hearts working shame in their bodies with one another
Rom  Because by them the true word of God was changed into that which is false and they gave worship and honour to the thing which is made and not to him who made it to whom be blessing for ever So be it
Rom  For this reason God gave them up to evil passions and their women were changing the natural use into one which is unnatural
Rom  And in the same way the men gave up the natural use of the woman and were burning in their desire for one another men doing shame with men and getting in their bodies the right reward of their evildoing
Rom  And because they had not the mind to keep God in their knowledge God gave them up to an evil mind to do those things which are not right
Rom  Being full of all wrongdoing evil desire for the goods of others hate envy putting to death fighting deceit cruel ways evil talk and false statements about others
Rom  Hated by God full of pride without respect full of loud talk given to evil inventions not honouring father or mother
Rom  Without knowledge not true to their undertakings unkind having no mercy
Rom  Who though they have knowledge of the law of God that the fate of those who do these things is death not only go on doing these things themselves but give approval to those who do them
Rom  So you have no reason whoever you are for judging for in judging another you are judging yourself for you do the same things
Rom  And we are conscious that God is a true judge against those who do such things
Rom  But you who are judging another for doing what you do yourself are you hoping that Gods decision will not take effect against you
Rom  Or is it nothing to you that God had pity on you waiting and putting up with you for so long not seeing that in his pity Gods desire is to give you a change of heart
Rom  But by your hard and unchanged heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of the revelation of Gods judging in righteousness
Rom  Who will give to every man his right reward
Rom  To those who go on with good works in the hope of glory and honour and salvation from death he will give eternal life
Rom  But to those who from a love of competition are not guided by what is true will come the heat of his wrath
Rom  Trouble and sorrow on all whose works are evil to the Jew first and then to the Greek
Rom  But glory and honour and peace to all whose works are good to the Jew first and then to the Greek
Rom  For one man is not different from another before God
Rom  All those who have done wrong without the law will get destruction without the law and those who have done wrong under the law will have their punishment by the law
Rom  For it is not the hearers of the law who will be judged as having righteousness before God but only the doers
Rom  For when the Gentiles without the law have a natural desire to do the things in the law they are a law to themselves
Rom  Because the work of the law is seen in their hearts their sense of right and wrong giving witness to it while their minds are at one time judging them and at another giving them approval
Rom  In the day when God will be a judge of the secrets of men as it says in the good news of which I am a preacher through Jesus Christ
Rom  But as for you who have the name of Jew and are resting on the law and take pride in God
Rom  And have knowledge of his desires and are a judge of the things which are different having the learning of the law
Rom  In the belief that you are a guide to the blind a light to those in the dark
Rom  A teacher of the foolish having in the law the form of knowledge and of what is true
Rom  You who give teaching to others do you give it to yourself you who say that a man may not take what is not his do you take what is not yours
Rom  You who say that a man may not be untrue to his wife are you true to yours you who are a hater of images do you do wrong to the house of God
Rom  You who take pride in the law are you doing wrong to the honour of God by behaviour which is against the law
Rom  For the name of God is shamed among the Gentiles because of you as it is said in the holy Writings
Rom  It is true that circumcision is of use if you keep the law but if you go against the law it is as if you had it not
Rom  If those who have not circumcision keep the rules of the law will it not be credited to them as circumcision
Rom  And they by their keeping of the law without circumcision will be judges of you by whom the law is broken though you have the letter of the law and circumcision
Rom  The true Jew is not one who is only so publicly and circumcision is not that which may be seen in the flesh
Rom  But he is a Jew who is a secret one whose circumcision is of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not from men but from God
Rom  How then is the Jew better off or what profit is there in circumcision
Rom  Much in every way first of all because the words of God were given to them
Rom  And if some have no faith will that make the faith of God without effect
Rom  In no way but let God be true though every man is seen to be untrue as it is said in the Writings That your words may be seen to be true and you may be seen to be right when you are judged
Rom  But if the righteousness of God is supported by our wrongdoing what is to be said is it wrong for God to be angry as men may say
Rom  In no way because if it is so how is God able to be the judge of all the world
Rom  But if because I am untrue God being seen to be true gets more glory why am I to be judged as a sinner
Rom  Let us not do evil so that good may come a statement which we are falsely said by some to have made because such behaviour will have its right punishment
Rom  What then are we worse off than they In no way because we have before made it clear that Jews as well as Greeks are all under the power of sin
Rom  As it is said in the holy Writings There is not one who does righteousness
Rom  Not one who has the knowledge of what is right not one who is a searcher after God
Rom  They have all gone out of the way there is no profit in any of them there is not one who does good not so much as one
Rom  Their throat is like an open place of death with their tongues they have said what is not true the poison of snakes is under their lips
Rom  Whose mouth is full of curses and bitter words
Rom  Their feet are quick in running after blood
Rom  Destruction and trouble are in their ways
Rom  And of the way of peace they have no knowledge
Rom  There is no fear of God before their eyes
Rom  Now we have knowledge that what the law says is for those who are under the law so that every mouth may be stopped and all men may be judged by God
Rom  Because by the works of the law no man is able to have righteousness in his eyes for through the law comes the knowledge of sin
Rom  But now without the law there is a revelation of the righteousness of God to which witness is given by the law and the prophets
Rom  That is the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all those who have faith and one man is not different from another
Rom  For all have done wrong and are far from the glory of God
Rom  And they may have righteousness put to their credit freely by his grace through the salvation which is in Christ Jesus
Rom  Whom God has put forward as the sign of his mercy through faith by his blood to make clear his righteousness when in his pity God let the sins of earlier times go without punishment
Rom  And to make clear his righteousness now so that he might himself be upright and give righteousness to him who has faith in Jesus
Rom  What reason then is there for pride It is shut out By what sort of law of works No but by a law of faith
Rom  For this reason then a man may get righteousness by faith without the works of the law
Rom  Or is God the God of Jews only is he not in the same way the God of Gentiles Yes of Gentiles
Rom  If God is one and he will give righteousness because of faith to those who have circumcision and through faith to those who have not circumcision
Rom  Do we then through faith make the law of no effect in no way but we make it clear that the law is important
Rom  What then may we say that Abraham our father after the flesh has got
Rom  For if Abraham got righteousness by works he has reason for pride but not before God
Rom  But what does it say in the holy Writings And Abraham had faith in God and it was put to his account as righteousness
Rom  Now the reward is credited to him who does works not as of grace but as a debt
Rom  But to him who without working has faith in him who gives righteousness to the evildoer his faith is put to his account as righteousness
Rom  As David says that there is a blessing on the man to whose account God puts righteousness without works saying
Rom  Happy are those who have forgiveness for their wrongdoing and whose sins are covered
Rom  Happy is the man against whom no sin is recorded by the Lord
Rom  Is this blessing then for the circumcision only or in the same way for those who have not circumcision for we say that the faith of Abraham was put to his account as righteousness
Rom  How then was it judged when he had circumcision or when he had it not Not when he had it but when he did not have it
Rom  And he was given the sign of circumcision as a witness of the faith which he had before he underwent circumcision so that he might be the father of all those who have faith though they have not circumcision and so that righteousness might be put to their account
Rom  And the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision but who keep to the way of that faith which our father Abraham had before he underwent circumcision
Rom  For Gods word that the earth would be his heritage was given to Abraham not through the law but through the righteousness of faith
Rom  For if they who are of the law are the people who get the heritage then faith is made of no use and the word of God has no power
Rom  For the outcome of the law is wrath but where there is no law it will not be broken
Rom  For this reason it is of faith so that it may be through grace and so that the word of God may be certain to all the seed not only to that which is of the law but to that which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all
Rom  As it is said in the holy Writings I have made you a father of a number of nations before him in whom he had faith that is God who gives life to the dead and to whom the things which are not are as if they were
Rom  Who without reason for hope in faith went on hoping so that he became the father of a number of nations as it had been said So will your seed be
Rom  And not being feeble in faith though his body seemed to him little better than dead he being about a hundred years old and Sarah was no longer able to have children
Rom  Still he did not give up faith in the undertaking of God but was made strong by faith giving glory to God
Rom  And being certain that God was able to keep his word
Rom  For which reason it was put to his account as righteousness
Rom  Now it was not because of him only that this was said
Rom  But for us in addition to whose account it will be put if we have faith in him who made Jesus our Lord come back again from the dead
Rom  Who was put to death for our evildoing and came to life again so that we might have righteousness
Rom  For which reason because we have righteousness through faith let us be at peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ
Rom  Through whom in the same way we have been able by faith to come to this grace in which we now are and let us have joy in hope of the glory of God
Rom  And not only so but let us have joy in our troubles in the knowledge that trouble gives us the power of waiting
Rom  And waiting gives experience and experience hope
Rom  And hope does not put to shame because our hearts are full of the love of God through the Holy Spirit which is given to us
Rom  For when we were still without strength at the right time Christ gave his life for evildoers
Rom  Now it is hard for anyone to give his life even for an upright man though it might be that for a good man someone would give his life
Rom  But God has made clear his love to us in that when we were still sinners Christ gave his life for us
Rom  Much more if we now have righteousness by his blood will salvation from the wrath of God come to us through him
Rom  For if when we were haters of God the death of his Son made us at peace with him much more now that we are his friends will we have salvation through his life
Rom  And not only so but we have joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ through whom we are now at peace with God
Rom  For this reason as through one man sin came into the world and death because of sin and so death came to all men because all have done evil
Rom  Because till the law came sin was in existence but sin is not put to the account of anyone when there is no law to be broken
Rom  But still death had power from Adam till Moses even over those who had not done wrong like Adam who is a picture of him who was to come
Rom  But the free giving of God is not like the wrongdoing of man For if by the wrongdoing of one man death came to numbers of men much more did the grace of God and the free giving by the grace of one man Jesus Christ come to men
Rom  And the free giving has not the same effect as the sin of one for the effect of one mans sin was punishment by the decision of God but the free giving had power to give righteousness to wrongdoers in great number
Rom  For if by the wrongdoing of one death was ruling through the one much more will those to whom has come the wealth of grace and the giving of righteousness be ruling in life through the one even Jesus Christ
Rom  So then as the effect of one act of wrongdoing was that punishment came on all men even so the effect of one act of righteousness was righteousness of life for all men
Rom  Because as numbers of men became sinners through the wrongdoing of one man even so will great numbers get righteousness through the keeping of the word of God by one man
Rom  And the law came in addition to make wrongdoing worse but where there was much sin there was much more grace
Rom  That as sin had power in death so grace might have power through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord
Rom  What may we say then are we to go on in sin so that there may be more grace
Rom  In no way How may we who are dead to sin be living in it any longer
Rom  Or are you without the knowledge that all we who had baptism into Christ Jesus had baptism into his death
Rom  We have been placed with him among the dead through baptism into death so that as Christ came again from the dead by the glory of the Father we in the same way might be living in new life
Rom  For if we have been made like him in his death we will in the same way be like him in his coming to life again
Rom  Being conscious that our old man was put to death on the cross with him so that the body of sin might be put away and we might no longer be servants to sin
Rom  Because he who is dead is free from sin
Rom  But if we are dead with Christ we have faith that we will be living with him
Rom  Having knowledge that because Christ has come back from the dead he will never again go down to the dead death has no more power over him
Rom  For his death was a death to sin but his life now is a life which he is living to God
Rom  Even so see yourselves as dead to sin but living to God in Christ Jesus
Rom  For this cause do not let sin be ruling in your body which is under the power of death so that you give way to its desires
Rom  And do not give your bodies to sin as the instruments of wrongdoing but give yourselves to God as those who are living from the dead and your bodies as instruments of righteousness to God
Rom  For sin may not have rule over you because you are not under law but under grace
Rom  What then are we to go on in sin because we are not under law but under grace Let it not be so
Rom  Are you not conscious that you are the servants of him to whom you give yourselves to do his desire if to sin the end being death or if to do the desire of God the end being righteousness
Rom  But praise be to God that though you were the servants of sin you have now given yourselves freely to that form of teaching under which you were placed
Rom  And being made free from sin you have been made the servants of righteousness
Rom  I am using words in the way of men because your flesh is feeble as you gave your bodies as servants to what is unclean and to evil to do evil so now give them as servants to righteousness to do what is holy
Rom  When you were servants of sin you were free from righteousness
Rom  What fruit had you at that time in the things which are now a shame to you for the end of such things is death
Rom  But now being free from sin and having been made servants to God you have your fruit in that which is holy and the end is eternal life
Rom  For the reward of sin is death but what God freely gives is eternal life in Jesus Christ our Lord
Rom  Is it not clear my brothers I am using an argument to those who have knowledge of the law that the law has power over a man as long as he is living
Rom  For the woman who has a husband is placed by the law under the power of her husband as long as he is living but if her husband is dead she is free from the law of the husband
Rom  So if while the husband is living she is joined to another man she will get the name of one who is untrue to her husband but if the husband is dead she is free from the law so that she is not untrue even if she takes another man
Rom  In the same way my brothers you were made dead to the law through the body of Christ so that you might be joined to another even to him who came again from the dead so that we might give fruit to God
Rom  For when we were in the flesh the evil passions which came into being through the law were working in our bodies to give the fruit of death
Rom  But now we are free from the law having been made dead to that which had power over us so that we are servants in the new way of the spirit not in the old way of the letter
Rom  What then is to be said is the law sin in no way But I would not have had knowledge of sin but for the law for I would not have been conscious of desire if the law had not said You may not have a desire for what is anothers
Rom  But sin taking its chance through that which was ordered by the law was working in me every form of desire because without the law sin is dead
Rom  And there was a time when I was living without the law but when the law gave its orders sin came to life and put me to death
Rom  And I made the discovery that the law whose purpose was to give life had become a cause of death
Rom  For I was tricked and put to death by sin which took its chance through the law
Rom  But the law is holy and its orders are holy upright and good
Rom  Was then that which is good death to me In no way But the purpose was that sin might be seen to be sin by working death to me through that which is good so that through the orders of the law sin might seem much more evil
Rom  For we are conscious that the law is of the spirit but I am of the flesh given into the power of sin
Rom  And I have no clear knowledge of what I am doing for that which I have a mind to do I do not but what I have hate for that I do
Rom  But if I do that which I have no mind to do I am in agreement with the law that the law is good
Rom  So it is no longer I who do it but the sin living in me
Rom  For I am conscious that in me that is in my flesh there is nothing good I have the mind but not the power to do what is right
Rom  For the good which I have a mind to do I do not but the evil which I have no mind to do that I do
Rom  But if I do what I have no mind to do it is no longer I who do it but the sin living in me
Rom  So I see a law that though I have a mind to do good evil is present in me
Rom  In my heart I take pleasure in the law of God
Rom  But I see another law in my body working against the law of my mind and making me the servant of the law of sin which is in my flesh
Rom  How unhappy am I who will make me free from the body of this death
Rom  I give praise to God through Jesus Christ our Lord So with my mind I am a servant to the law of God but with my flesh to the law of sin
Rom  For this cause those who are in Christ Jesus will not be judged as sinners
Rom  For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death
Rom  For what the law was not able to do because it was feeble through the flesh God sending his Son in the image of the evil flesh and as an offering for sin gave his decision against sin in the flesh
Rom  So that what was ordered by the law might be done in us who are living not in the way of the flesh but in the way of the Spirit
Rom  For those who are living in the way of the flesh give their minds to the things of the flesh but those who go in the way of the Spirit to the things of the Spirit
Rom  For the mind of the flesh is death but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace
Rom  Because the mind of the flesh is opposite to God it is not under the law of God and is not able to be
Rom  So that those who are in the flesh are not able to give pleasure to God
Rom  You are not in the flesh but in the Spirit if the Spirit of God is in you But if any man has not the Spirit of Christ he is not one of his
Rom  And if Christ is in you the body is dead because of sin but the Spirit is life because of righteousness
Rom  But if the Spirit of him who made Jesus come again from the dead is in you he who made Christ Jesus come again from the dead will in the same way through his Spirit which is in you give life to your bodies which now are under the power of death
Rom  So then my brothers we are in debt not to the flesh to be living in the way of the flesh
Rom  For if you go in the way of the flesh death will come on you but if by the Spirit you put to death the works of the body you will have life
Rom  And all those who are guided by the Spirit of God are sons of God
Rom  For you did not get the spirit of servants again to put you in fear but the spirit of sons was given to you by which we say Abba Father
Rom  The Spirit is witness with our spirit that we are children of God
Rom  And if we are children we have a right to a part in the heritage a part in the things of God together with Christ so that if we have a part in his pain we will in the same way have a part in his glory
Rom  I am of the opinion that there is no comparison between the pain of this present time and the glory which we will see in the future
Rom  For the strong desire of every living thing is waiting for the revelation of the sons of God
Rom  For every living thing was put under the power of change not by its desire but by him who made it so in hope
Rom  That all living things will be made free from the power of death and will have a part with the free children of God in glory
Rom  For we are conscious that all living things are weeping and sorrowing in pain together till now
Rom  And not only so but we who have the first fruits of the Spirit even we have sorrow in our minds waiting for the time when we will take our place as sons that is the salvation of our bodies
Rom  For our salvation is by hope but hope which is seen is not hope for who is hoping for what he sees
Rom  But if we have hope for that which we see not then we will be able to go on waiting for it
Rom  And in the same way the Spirit is a help to our feeble hearts for we are not able to make prayer to God in the right way but the Spirit puts our desires into words which are not in our power to say
Rom  And he who is the searcher of hearts has knowledge of the mind of the Spirit because he is making prayers for the saints in agreement with the mind of God
Rom  And we are conscious that all things are working together for good to those who have love for God and have been marked out by his purpose
Rom  Because those of whom he had knowledge before they came into existence were marked out by him to be made like his Son so that he might be the first among a band of brothers
Rom  And those who were marked out by him were named and those who were named were given righteousness and to those to whom he gave righteousness in the same way he gave glory
Rom  What may we say about these things If God is for us who is against us
Rom  He who did not keep back his only Son but gave him up for us all will he not with him freely give us all things
Rom  Who will say anything against the saints of God It is God who makes us clear from evil
Rom  Who will give a decision against us It is Christ Jesus who not only was put to death but came again from the dead who is now at the right hand of God taking our part
Rom  Who will come between us and the love of Christ Will trouble or pain or cruel acts or the need of food or of clothing or danger or the sword
Rom  As it is said in the holy Writings Because of you we are put to death every day we are like sheep ready for destruction
Rom  But we are able to overcome all these things and more through his love
Rom  For I am certain that not death or life or angels or rulers or things present or things to come or powers
Rom  Or things on high or things under the earth or anything which is made will be able to come between us and the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord
Rom  I say what is true in Christ and not what is false my mind giving witness with me in the Holy Spirit
Rom  That I am full of sorrow and pain without end
Rom  For I have a desire to take on myself the curse for my brothers my family in the flesh
Rom  Who are Israelites who have the place of sons and the glory and the agreements with God and the giving of the law and the worship and the hope offered by God
Rom  Whose are the fathers and of whom came Christ in the flesh who is over all God to whom be blessing for ever So be it
Rom  But it is not as if the word of God was without effect For they are not all Israel who are of Israel
Rom  And they are not all children because they are the seed of Abraham but In Isaac will your seed be named
Rom  That is it is not the children of the flesh but the children of Gods undertaking who are named as the seed
Rom  For this is the word of Gods undertaking At this time will I come and Sarah will have a son
Rom  And not only so but Rebecca being about to have a child by our father Isaac
Rom  Before the children had come into existence or had done anything good or bad in order that Gods purpose and his selection might be effected not by works but by him whose purpose it is
Rom  It was said to her The older will be the servant of the younger
Rom  Even as it is said I had love for Jacob but for Esau I had hate
Rom  What may we say then is God not upright let it not be said
Rom  For he says to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and pity on whom I will have pity
Rom  So then it is not by the desire or by the attempt of man but by the mercy of God
Rom  For the holy Writings say to Pharaoh For this same purpose did I put you on high so that I might make my power seen in you and that there might be knowledge of my name through all the earth
Rom  So then at his pleasure he has mercy on a man and at his pleasure he makes the heart hard
Rom  But you will say to me Why does he still make us responsible who is able to go against his purpose
Rom  But O man who are you to make answer against God May the thing which is made say to him who made it Why did you make me so
Rom  Or has not the potter the right to make out of one part of his earth a vessel for honour and out of another a vessel for shame
Rom  What if God desiring to let his wrath and his power be seen for a long time put up with the vessels of wrath which were ready for destruction
Rom  And to make clear the wealth of his glory to vessels of mercy which he had before made ready for glory
Rom  Even us who were marked out by him not only from the Jews but from the Gentiles
Rom  As he says in Hosea They will be named my people who were not my people and she will be loved who was not loved
Rom  And in the place where it was said to them You are not my people there they will be named the sons of the living God
Rom  And Isaiah says about Israel Even if the number of the children of Israel is as the sand of the sea only a small part will get salvation
Rom  For the Lord will give effect to his word on the earth putting an end to it and cutting it short
Rom  And as Isaiah had said before If the Lord of armies had not given us a seed we would have been like Sodom and Gomorrah
Rom  What then may we say That the nations who did not go after righteousness have got righteousness even the righteousness which is of faith
Rom  But Israel going after a law of righteousness did not get it
Rom  Why Because they were not searching for it by faith but by works They came up against the stone which was in the way
Rom  As it is said See I am putting in Zion a stone causing a fall and a rock in the way but he who has faith in him will not be put to shame
Rom  Brothers my hearts desire and my prayer to God for them is that they may get salvation
Rom  For I give witness of them that they have a strong desire for God but not with knowledge
Rom  Because not having knowledge of Gods righteousness and desiring to give effect to their righteousness they have not put themselves under the righteousness of God
Rom  For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who has faith
Rom  For Moses says that the man who does the righteousness which is of the law will get life by it
Rom  But the righteousness which is of faith says these words Say not in your heart Who will go up to heaven that is to make Christ come down
Rom  Or Who will go down into the deep that is to make Christ come again from the dead
Rom  But what does it say The word is near you in your mouth and in your heart that is the word of faith of which we are the preachers
Rom  Because if you say with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and have faith in your heart that God has made him come back from the dead you will have salvation
Rom  For with the heart man has faith to get righteousness and with the mouth he says that Jesus is Lord to get salvation
Rom  Because it is said in the holy Writings Whoever has faith in him will not be shamed
Rom  And the Jew is not different from the Greek for there is the same Lord of all who is good to all who have hope in his name
Rom  Because Whoever will give worship to the name of the Lord will get salvation
Rom  But how will they give worship to him in whom they have no faith and how will they have faith in him of whom they have not had news and how will they have news without a preacher
Rom  And how will there be preachers if they are not sent As it is said How beautiful are the feet of those who give the glad news of good things
Rom  But they have not all given ear to the good news For Isaiah says Lord who has had faith in our word
Rom  So faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of Christ
Rom  But I say Did not the word come to their ears Yes certainly Their sound has gone out into all the earth and their words to the ends of the world
Rom  But I say Had Israel no knowledge First Moses says You will be moved to envy by that which is not a nation and by a foolish people I will make you angry
Rom  And Isaiah says without fear Those who were not searching for me made discovery of me and I was seen by those whose hearts were turned away from me
Rom  But about Israel he says All the day my hands have been stretched out to a people whose hearts were turned away and who put themselves against my word
Rom  So I say Has God put his people on one side Let there be no such thought For I am of Israel of the seed of Abraham of the tribe of Benjamin
Rom  God has not put away the people of his selection Or have you no knowledge of what is said about Elijah in the holy Writings how he says words to God against Israel
Rom  Lord they have put your prophets to death and made waste your altars and now I am the last and they are searching for me to take away my life
Rom  But what answer does God make to him I have still seven thousand men whose knees have not been bent to Baal
Rom  In the same way there are at this present time some who are marked out by the selection of grace
Rom  But if it is of grace then it is no longer of works or grace would not be grace
Rom  What then That which Israel was searching for he did not get but those of the selection got it and the rest were made hard
Rom  As it was said in the holy Writings God gave them a spirit of sleep eyes which might not see and ears which have no hearing to this day
Rom  And David says Let their table be made a net for taking them and a stone in their way and a punishment
Rom  Let their eyes be made dark so that they may not see and let their back be bent down at all times
Rom  So I say Were their steps made hard in order that they might have a fall In no way but by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles so that they might be moved to envy
Rom  Now if their fall is the wealth of the world and their loss the wealth of the Gentiles how much greater will be the glory when they are made full
Rom  But I say to you Gentiles in so far as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles I make much of my position
Rom  If in any way those who are of my flesh may be moved to envy so that some of them may get salvation by me
Rom  For if by their putting away the rest of men have been made friends with God what will their coming back again be but life from the dead
Rom  And if the firstfruit is holy so is the mass and if the root is holy so are the branches
Rom  But if some of the branches were broken off and you an olivetree of the fields were put in among them and were given a part with them in the root by which the olivetree is made fertile
Rom  Do not be uplifted in pride over the branches because it is not you who are the support of the root but it is by the root that you are supported
Rom  You will say Branches were broken off so that I might be put in
Rom  Truly because they had no faith they were broken off and you have your place by reason of your faith Do not be lifted up in pride but have fear
Rom  For if God did not have mercy on the natural branches he will not have mercy on you
Rom  See then that God is good but his rules are fixed to those who were put away he was hard but to you he has been good on the condition that you keep in his mercy if not you will be cut off as they were
Rom  And they if they do not go on without faith will be united to the tree again because God is able to put them in again
Rom  For if you were cut out of a field olivetree and against the natural use were united to a good olivetree how much more will these the natural branches be united again with the olivetree which was theirs
Rom  For it is my desire brothers that this secret may be clear to you so that you may not have pride in your knowledge that Israel has been made hard in part till all the Gentiles have come in
Rom  And so all Israel will get salvation as it is said in the holy Writings There will come out of Zion the One who makes free by him wrongdoing will be taken away from Jacob
Rom  And this is my agreement with them when I will take away their sins
Rom  As far as the good news is in question they are cut off from God on account of you but as far as the selection is in question they are loved on account of the fathers
Rom  Because Gods selection and his mercies may not be changed
Rom  For as you in time past were not under the rule of God but now have got mercy through their turning away
Rom  So in the same way these have gone against the orders of God so that by the mercy given to you they may now get mercy
Rom  For God has let them all go against his orders so that he might have mercy on them all
Rom  O how deep is the wealth of the wisdom and knowledge of God no one is able to make discovery of his decisions and his ways may not be searched out
Rom  Who has knowledge of the mind of the Lord or who has taken part in his purposes
Rom  Or who has first given to him and it will be given back to him again
Rom  For of him and through him and to him are all things To him be the glory for ever So be it
Rom  For this reason I make request to you brothers by the mercies of God that you will give your bodies as a living offering holy pleasing to God which is the worship it is right for you to give him
Rom  And let not your behaviour be like that of this world but be changed and made new in mind so that by experience you may have knowledge of the good and pleasing and complete purpose of God
Rom  But I say to every one of you through the grace given to me not to have an overhigh opinion of himself but to have wise thoughts as God has given to every one a measure of faith
Rom  For as we have a number of parts in one body but all the parts have not the same use
Rom  So we though we are a number of persons are one body in Christ and are dependent on one another
Rom  And having different qualities by reason of the grace given to us such as the quality of a prophet let it be made use of in relation to the measure of our faith
Rom  Or the position of a Deacon of the church let a man give himself to it or he who has the power of teaching let him make use of it
Rom  He who has the power of comforting let him do so he who gives let him give freely he who has the power of ruling let him do it with a serious mind he who has mercy on others let it be with joy
Rom  Let love be without deceit Be haters of what is evil keep your minds fixed on what is good
Rom  Be kind to one another with a brothers love putting others before yourselves in honour
Rom  Be not slow in your work but be quick in spirit as the Lords servants
Rom  Being glad in hope quiet in trouble at all times given to prayer
Rom  Giving to the needs of the saints ready to take people into your houses
Rom  Give blessing and not curses to those who are cruel to you
Rom  Take part in the joy of those who are glad and in the grief of those who are sorrowing
Rom  Be in harmony with one another Do not have a high opinion of yourselves but be in agreement with common people Do not give yourselves an air of wisdom
Rom  Do not give evil for evil to any man Let all your business be well ordered in the eyes of all men
Rom  As far as it is possible for you be at peace with all men
Rom  Do not give punishment for wrongs done to you dear brothers but give way to the wrath of God for it is said in the holy Writings Punishment is mine I will give reward says the Lord
Rom  But if one who has hate for you is in need of food or of drink give it to him for in so doing you will put coals of fire on his head
Rom  Do not let evil overcome you but overcome evil by good
Rom  Let everyone put himself under the authority of the higher powers because there is no power which is not of God and all powers are ordered by God
Rom  For which reason everyone who puts himself against the authority puts himself against the order of God and those who are against it will get punishment for themselves
Rom  For rulers are not a cause of fear to the good work but to the evil If you would have no fear of the authority do good and you will have praise
Rom  For he is the servant of God to you for good But if you do evil have fear for the sword is not in his hand for nothing he is Gods servant making Gods punishment come on the evildoer
Rom  So put yourselves under the authority not for fear of wrath but because you have the knowledge of what is right
Rom  For the same reason make payment of taxes because the authority is Gods servant to take care of such things at all times
Rom  Give to all what is their right taxes to him whose they are payment to him whose right it is fear to whom fear honour to whom honour is to be given
Rom  Be in debt for nothing but to have love for one another for he who has love for his neighbour has kept all the law
Rom  And this Do not be untrue in married life Do not put to death Do not take what is anothers Do not have desire for what is anothers and if there is any other order it is covered by this word Have love for your neighbour as for yourself
Rom  Love does no wrong to his neighbour so love makes the law complete
Rom  See then that the time has come for you to be awake from sleep for now is your salvation nearer than when you first had faith
Rom  The night is far gone and the day is near so let us put off the works of the dark arming ourselves with light
Rom  With right behaviour as in the day not in pleasuremaking and drinking not in bad company and unclean behaviour not in fighting and envy
Rom  But put on the Lord Jesus Christ and do not give thought to the flesh to do its desires
Rom  Do not put on one side him who is feeble in faith and do not put him in doubt by your reasonings
Rom  One man has faith to take all things as food another who is feeble in faith takes only green food
Rom  Let not him who takes food have a low opinion of him who does not and let not him who does not take food be a judge of him who does for he has Gods approval
Rom  Who are you to make yourself a judge of another mans servant it is to his master that he is responsible for good or bad Yes his place will be safe because the Lord is able to keep him from falling
Rom  This man puts one day before another to that man they are the same Let every man be certain in his mind
Rom  He who keeps the day keeps it to the Lord and he who takes food takes it as to the Lord for he gives praise to God and he who does not take food to the Lord he takes it not and gives praise to God
Rom  For every mans life and every mans death has a relation to others as well as to himself
Rom  As long as we have life we are living to the Lord or if we give up our life it is to the Lord so if we are living or if our life comes to an end we are the Lords
Rom  And for this purpose Christ went into death and came back again that he might be the Lord of the dead and of the living
Rom  But you why do you make yourself your brothers judge or again why have you no respect for your brother because we will all have to take our place before God as our judge
Rom  For it is said in the holy Writings By my life says the Lord to me every knee will be bent and every tongue will give worship to God
Rom  So every one of us will have to give an account of himself to God
Rom  Then let us not be judges of one another any longer but keep this in mind that no man is to make it hard for his brother or give him cause for doubting
Rom  I am conscious of this and am certain in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself but for the man in whose opinion it is unclean for him it is unclean
Rom  And if because of food your brother is troubled then you are no longer going on in the way of love Do not let your food be destruction to him for whom Christ went into death
Rom  Let it not be possible for men to say evil about your good
Rom  For the kingdom of God is not food and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit
Rom  And he who in these things is Christs servant is pleasing to God and has the approval of men
Rom  So then let us go after the things which make peace and the things by which we may be a help to one another
Rom  Do not let the work of God come to nothing on account of food All things are certainly clean but it is evil for that man who by taking food makes it hard for another
Rom  It is better not to take meat or wine or to do anything which might be a cause of trouble to your brother
Rom  The faith which you have have it to yourself before God Happy is the man who is not judged by that to which he gives approval
Rom  But he who is in doubt is judged if he takes food because he does it not in faith and whatever is not of faith is sin
Rom  We who are strong have to be a support to the feeble and not give pleasure to ourselves
Rom  Let every one of us give pleasure to his neighbour for his good to make him strong
Rom  For Christ did not give pleasure to himself but as it is said The bitter words of those who were angry with you came on me
Rom  Now those things which were put down in writing before our time were for our learning so that through quiet waiting and through the comfort of the holy Writings we might have hope
Rom  Now may the God who gives comfort and strength in waiting make you of the same mind with one another in harmony with Christ Jesus
Rom  So that with one mouth you may give glory to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
Rom  So then take one another to your hearts as Christ took us to the glory of God
Rom  Now I say that Christ has been made a servant of the circumcision to give effect to the undertakings given by God to the fathers
Rom  And so that the Gentiles might give glory to God for his mercy as it is said For this reason I will give praise to you among the Gentiles and I will make a song to your name
Rom  And again he says Take part you Gentiles in the joy of his people
Rom  And again Give praise to the Lord all you Gentiles and let all the nations give praise to him
Rom  And again Isaiah says There will be the root of Jesse and he who comes to be the ruler over the Gentiles in him will the Gentiles put their hope
Rom  Now may the God of hope make you full of joy and peace through faith so that all hope may be yours in the power of the Holy Spirit
Rom  And I myself am certain of you brothers that you are full of what is good complete in all knowledge able to give direction to one another
Rom  But I have in some measure less fear in writing to you to put these things before you again because of the grace which was given to me by God
Rom  To be a servant of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles doing the work of a priest in the good news of God so that the offering of the Gentiles might be pleasing to God being made holy by the Holy Spirit
Rom  So I have pride in Christ Jesus in the things which are Gods
Rom  And I will keep myself from talking of anything but those things which Christ has done by me to put the Gentiles under his rule in word and in act
Rom  By signs and wonders in the power of the Holy Spirit so that from Jerusalem and round about as far as Illyricum I have given all the good news of Christ
Rom  Making it my purpose not to take the good news where Christ was named so that my work might not be resting on that of others
Rom  But as it is said in the holy Writings They will see to whom the news of him had not been given and those to whose ears it had not come will have knowledge
Rom  For which reason I was frequently kept from coming to you
Rom  But now having no longer any place in these parts and having had for a number of years a great desire to come to you
Rom  Whenever I go to Spain for it is my hope to see you on my way and to be sent on there by you if first I may in some measure have been comforted by your company
Rom  But now I go to Jerusalem taking help for the saints
Rom  For it has been the good pleasure of those of Macedonia and Achaia to send a certain amount of money for the poor among the saints at Jerusalem
Rom  Yes it has been their good pleasure and they are in their debt For if the Gentiles have had a part in the things of the Spirit which were theirs it is right for them in the same way to give them help in the things of the flesh
Rom  So when I have done this and have given them this fruit of love I will go on by you into Spain
Rom  And I am certain that when I come I will be full of the blessing of Christ
Rom  Now I make request to you brothers by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit that you will be working together with me in your prayers to God for me
Rom  So that I may be kept safe from those in Judaea who have not put themselves under the rule of God and that the help which I am taking for Jerusalem may be pleasing to the saints
Rom  So that I may come to you in joy by the good pleasure of God and have rest with you
Rom  Now may the God of peace be with you all So be it
Rom  It is my desire to say a good word for Phoebe who is a servant of the church in Cenchreae
Rom  That you will take her in kindly after the way of the saints as one who is the Lords and give her help in anything in which she may have need of you because she has been a help to a great number and to myself
Rom  Give my love to Prisca and Aquila workers with me in Christ Jesus
Rom  Who for my life put their necks in danger to whom not only I but all the churches of the Gentiles are in debt
Rom  And say a kind word to the church which is in their house Give my love to my dear Epaenetus who is the first fruit of Asia to Christ
Rom  Give my love to Mary who gave much care to you
Rom  Give my love to Andronicus and Junia my relations who were in prison with me who are noted among the Apostles and who were in Christ before me
Rom  Give my love to Ampliatus who is dear to me in the Lord
Rom  Give my love to Urbanus a worker in Christ with us and to my dear Stachys
Rom  Give my love to Apelles who has the approval of Christ Say a kind word to those who are of the house of Aristobulus
Rom  Give my love to Herodion my relation Say a kind word to those of the house of Narcissus who are in the Lord
Rom  Give my love to Tryphaena and Tryphosa workers in the Lord Give my love to my dear Persis who did much work in the Lord
Rom  Give my love to Rufus one of the Lords selection and to his mother and mine
Rom  Give my love to Asyncritus Phlegon Hermes Patrobas Hermas and the brothers who are with them
Rom  Give my love to Philologus and Julia Nereus and his sister and Olympas and all the saints who are with them
Rom  Give one another a holy kiss All the churches of Christ send their love to you
Rom  Now it is my desire brothers that you will take note of those who are causing division and trouble among you quite against the teaching which was given to you and keep away from them
Rom  For such people are not servants of the Lord Christ but of their stomachs and by their smooth and wellsaid words the hearts of those who have no knowledge of evil are tricked
Rom  For all have knowledge of how you do what you are ordered For this reason I have joy in you but it is my desire that you may be wise in what is good and without knowledge of evil
Rom  And the God of peace will be crushing Satan under your feet before long The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you
Rom  Timothy who is working with me sends his love to you so do Lucius and Jason and Sosipater my relations
Rom  I Tertius who have done the writing of this letter send love in the Lord
Rom  Gaius with whom I am living whose house is open to all the church sends his love so does Erastus the manager of the accounts of the town and Quartus the brother
Rom  
Rom  Now to him who is able to make you strong in agreement with the good news which I gave you and the preaching of Jesus Christ in the light of the revelation of that secret which has been kept through times eternal
Rom  But is now made clear and by the writings of the prophets by the order of the eternal God the knowledge of it has been given to all the nations so that they may come under the rule of the faith
Rom  To the only wise God through Jesus Christ be the glory for ever So be it
Co  Paul an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the purpose of God and Sosthenes the brother
Co  To the church of God which is in Corinth to those who have been made holy in Christ Jesus saints by the selection of God with all those who in every place give honour to the name of our Lord Jesus Christ their Lord and ours
Co  Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
Co  I give praise to my God for you at all times because of the grace of God which has been given to you in Christ Jesus
Co  So that in him you have wealth in all things in word and in knowledge of every sort
Co  Even as the witness of the Christ has been made certain among you
Co  So that having every grace you are living in the hope of the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ
Co  Who will give you strength to the end to be free from all sin in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ
Co  God is true through whom you have been given a part with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord
Co  Now I make request to you my brothers in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you will all say the same thing and that there may be no divisions among you so that you may be in complete agreement in the same mind and in the same opinion
Co  Because it has come to my knowledge through those of the house of Chloe that there are divisions among you my brothers
Co  That is that some of you say I am of Paul some say I am of Apollos some say I am of Cephas and some say I am Christs
Co  Is there a division in Christ was Paul nailed to the cross for you or were you given baptism in the name of Paul
Co  I give praise to God that not one of you had baptism from me but Crispus and Gaius
Co  So that no one may be able to say that you had baptism in my name
Co  And I gave baptism to the house of Stephanas but I am not certain that any others had baptism from me
Co  For Christ sent me not to give baptism but to be a preacher of the good news not with wise words for fear that the cross of Christ might be made of no value
Co  For the word of the cross seems foolish to those who are on the way to destruction but to us who are on the way to salvation it is the power of God
Co  As it says in the holy Writings I will put an end to the wisdom of the wise and will put on one side the designs of those who have knowledge
Co  Where is the wise where is he who has knowledge of the law where is the man of this world who has a love of discussion has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world
Co  For because by the purpose of God the world with all its wisdom had not the knowledge of God it was Gods pleasure by so foolish a thing as preaching to give salvation to those who had faith in him
Co  Seeing that the Jews make request for signs and the Greeks are looking for knowledge
Co  But we give the good news of Christ on the cross a hard thing to the Jews and a foolish thing to the Gentiles
Co  But to those of Gods selection Jews and Greeks Christ is the power and the wisdom of God
Co  Because what seems foolish in God is wiser than men and what seems feeble in God is stronger than men
Co  For you see Gods design for you my brothers that he has not taken a great number of the wise after the flesh not the strong not the noble
Co  But God made selection of the foolish things of this world so that he might put the wise to shame and the feeble things that he might put to shame the strong
Co  And the low things of the world and the things without honour did God make selection of yes even the things which are not so that he might make as nothing the things which are
Co  So that no flesh might have glory before God
Co  But God has given you a place in Christ Jesus through whom God has given us wisdom and righteousness and salvation and made us holy
Co  So that as it is said in the holy Writings Whoever has a desire for glory let his glory be in the Lord
Co  And when I came to you my brothers I did not come with wise words of knowledge putting before you the secret of God
Co  For I had made the decision to have knowledge of nothing among you but only of Jesus Christ on the cross
Co  And I was with you without strength in fear and in doubt
Co  And in my preaching there were no honeyed words of wisdom but I was dependent on the power of the Spirit to make it clear to you
Co  So that your faith might be based not on mans wisdom but on the power of God
Co  But still we have wisdom for those who are complete in knowledge though not the wisdom of this world and not of the rulers of this world who are coming to nothing
Co  But we give the news of the secret wisdom of God which he had kept in store before the world came into existence for our glory
Co  Of which not one of the rulers of this world had knowledge for if they had they would not have put the Lord of glory on the cross
Co  But as it says in the holy Writings Things which the eye saw not and which had not come to the ears or into the heart of man such things as God has made ready for those who have love for him
Co  But God has given us the revelation of these things through his Spirit for the Spirit makes search into all things even the deep things of God
Co  For who has knowledge of the things of a man but the spirit of the man which is in him in the same way no one has knowledge of the things of God but the Spirit of God
Co  But we have not the spirit of the world but the Spirit which comes from God so that we may have knowledge of the things which are freely given to us by God
Co  And these are the things which we say not in the language of mans wisdom but in words given to us by the Spirit judging the things of the spirit by the help of the Spirit
Co  For the natural man is not able to take in the things of the Spirit of God for they seem foolish to him and he is not able to have knowledge of them because such knowledge comes only through the Spirit
Co  But he who has the Spirit though judging all things is himself judged by no one
Co  For who has knowledge of the mind of the Lord so as to be his teacher But we have the mind of Christ
Co  And the teaching I gave you my brothers was such as I was able to give not to those who have the Spirit but to those who are still in the flesh even to children in Christ
Co  I gave you milk and not meat because you were then unable to take it and even now you are not able
Co  Because you are still in the flesh for when there is envy and division among you are you not still walking after the way of the flesh even as natural men
Co  For when one says I am of Paul and another says I am of Apollos are you not talking like natural men
Co  What then is Apollos and what is Paul They are but servants who gave you the good news as God gave it to them
Co  I did the planting Apollos did the watering but God gave the increase
Co  So then the planter is nothing and the waterer is nothing but God who gives the increase
Co  Now the planter and the waterer are working for the same end but they will have their separate rewards in the measure of their work
Co  For we are workers with God you are Gods planting Gods building
Co  In the measure of the grace given to me I as a wise masterbuilder have put the base in position and another goes on building on it But let every man take care what he puts on it
Co  For there is no other base for the building but that which has been put down which is Jesus Christ
Co  But on the base a man may put gold silver stones of great price wood dry grass cut stems
Co  Every mans work will be made clear in that day because it will be tested by fire and the fire itself will make clear the quality of every mans work
Co  If any mans work comes through the test he will have a reward
Co  If the fire puts an end to any mans work it will be his loss but he will get salvation himself though as by fire
Co  Do you not see that you are Gods holy house and that the Spirit of God has his place in you
Co  If anyone makes the house of God unclean God will put an end to him for the house of God is holy and you are his house
Co  Let no man have a false idea If any man seems to himself to be wise among you let him become foolish so that he may be wise
Co  For the wisdom of this world is foolish before God As it is said in the holy Writings He who takes the wise in their secret designs
Co  And again The Lord has knowledge of the reasonings of the wise that they are nothing
Co  So let no one take pride in men For all things are yours
Co  Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come all are yours
Co  And you are Christs and Christ is Gods
Co  Let us be judged as servants of Christ and as those who are responsible for the secret things of God
Co  And it is right for such servants to be safe persons
Co  But it is a small thing to me that I am judged by you or by mans judging I am not even a judge of myself
Co  For I am not conscious of any wrong in myself but this does not make me clear for it is the Lord who is my judge
Co  For this reason let there be no judging before the time till the Lord comes who will make clear the secret things of the dark and the designs of the heart and then will every man have his praise from God
Co  My brothers it is because of you that I have taken Apollos and myself as examples of these things so that in us you might see that it is not wise to go farther than what is in the holy Writings so that no one of you may be lifted up against his brother
Co  For who made you better than your brother or what have you that has not been given to you but if it has been given to you what cause have you for pride as if it had not been given to you
Co  For even now you are full even now you have wealth you have been made kings without us truly I would be glad if you were kings so that we might be kings with you
Co  For it seems to me that God has put us the Apostles last of all as men whose fate is death for we are put on view to the world and to angels and to men
Co  We are made to seem foolish for Christ but you are wise in Christ we are feeble but you are strong you have glory but we have shame
Co  Even to this hour we are without food drink and clothing we are given blows and have no certain restingplace
Co  And with our hands we do the hardest work when they give us curses we give blessings when we undergo punishment we take it quietly
Co  When evil things are said about us we give gentle answers we are made as the unclean things of the world as that for which no one has any use even till now
Co  I am not saying these things to put you to shame but so that as my dear children you may see what is right
Co  For even if you had ten thousand teachers in Christ you have not more than one father for in Christ Jesus I have given birth to you through the good news
Co  So my desire is that you take me as your example
Co  For this cause I have sent Timothy to you who is my dear and true child in the Lord he will make clear to you my ways in Christ even as I am teaching everywhere in every church
Co  Now some are full of pride as if I was not coming to you
Co  But I will come to you in a short time if it is pleasing to the Lord and I will take note not of the word of those who are full of pride but of the power
Co  For the kingdom of God is not in word but in power
Co  What is your desire is my coming to be with punishment or is it to be in love and a gentle spirit
Co  It is said in fact that there is among you a sin of the flesh such as is not seen even among the Gentiles that one of you has his fathers wife
Co  And in place of feeling sorrow you are pleased with yourselves so that he who has done this thing has not been sent away from among you
Co  For I myself being present in spirit though not in body have come to a decision about him who has done this thing
Co  In the name of our Lord Jesus when you have come together with my spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus
Co  That this man is to be handed over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh so that his spirit may have forgiveness in the day of the Lord Jesus
Co  This pride of yours is not good Do you not see that a little leaven makes a change in all the mass
Co  Take away then the old leaven so that you may be a new mass even as you are without leaven For Christ has been put to death as our Passover
Co  Let us then keep the feast not with old leaven and not with the leaven of evil thoughts and acts but with the unleavened bread of true thoughts and right feelings
Co  In my letter I said to you that you were not to keep company with those who go after the desires of the flesh
Co  But I had not in mind the sinners who are outside the church or those who have a desire for and take the property of others or those who give worship to images for it is not possible to keep away from such people without going out of the world completely
Co  But the sense of my letter was that if a brother had the name of being one who went after the desires of the flesh or had the desire for other peoples property or was in the way of using violent language or being the worse for drink or took by force what was not his you might not keep company with such a one or take food with him
Co  For it is no business of mine to be judging those who are outside but it is yours to be judging those who are among you
Co  As for those who are outside God is their judge So put away the evil man from among you
Co  How is it that if any one of you has a cause at law against another he takes it before a Gentile judge and not before the saints
Co  Is it not certain that the saints will be the judges of the world if then the world will be judged by you are you unable to give a decision about the smallest things
Co  Is it not certain that we are to be the judges of angels how much more then of the things of this life
Co  If then there are questions to be judged in connection with the things of this life why do you put them in the hands of those who have no position in the church
Co  I say this to put you to shame Is there not among you one wise man who may be able to give a decision between his brothers
Co  But a brother who has a cause at law against another takes it before Gentile judges
Co  More than this it is not to your credit to have causes at law with one another at all Why not put up with wrong why not undergo loss
Co  So far from doing this you yourselves do wrong and take your brothers property
Co  Have you not knowledge that evildoers will have no part in the kingdom of God Have no false ideas about this no one who goes after the desires of the flesh or gives worship to images or is untrue when married or is less than a man or makes a wrong use of men
Co  Or is a thief or the worse for drink or makes use of strong language or takes by force what is not his will have any part in the kingdom of God
Co  And such were some of you but you have been washed you have been made holy you have been given righteousness in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God
Co  I am free to do all things but not all things are wise I am free to do all things but I will not let myself come under the power of any
Co  Food is for the stomach and the stomach for food and God will put an end to them together But the body is not for the desires of the flesh but for the Lord and the Lord for the body
Co  And God who made the Lord Jesus come back from the dead will do the same for us by his power
Co  Do you not see that your bodies are part of the body of Christ how then may I take what is a part of the body of Christ and make it a part of the body of a loose woman such a thing may not be
Co  Or do you not see that he who is joined to a loose woman is one body with her for God has said The two of them will become one flesh
Co  But he who is united to the Lord is one spirit
Co  Keep away from the desires of the flesh Every sin which a man does is outside of the body but he who goes after the desires of the flesh does evil to his body
Co  Or are you not conscious that your body is a house for the Holy Spirit which is in you and which has been given to you by God and you are not the owners of yourselves
Co  For a payment has been made for you let God be honoured in your body
Co  Now as to the things in your letter to me It is good for a man to have nothing to do with a woman
Co  But because of the desires of the flesh let every man have his wife and every woman her husband
Co  Let the husband give to the wife what is right and let the wife do the same to the husband
Co  The wife has not power over her body but the husband and in the same way the husband has not power over his body but the wife
Co  Do not keep back from one another what is right but only for a short time and by agreement so that you may give yourselves to prayer and come together again so that Satan may not get the better of you through your loss of selfcontrol
Co  But this I say as my opinion and not as an order of the Lord
Co  It is my desire that all men might be even as I am But every man has the power of his special way of life given him by God one in this way and one in that
Co  But I say to the unmarried and to the widows It is good for them to be even as I am
Co  But if they have not selfcontrol let them get married for married life is better than the burning of desire
Co  But to the married I give orders though not I but the Lord that the wife may not go away from her husband
Co  Or if she goes away from him let her keep unmarried or be united to her husband again and that the husband may not go away from his wife
Co  But to the rest I say and not the Lord If a brother has a wife who is not a Christian and it is her desire to go on living with him let him not go away from her
Co  And if a woman has a husband who is not a Christian and it is his desire to go on living with her let her not go away from her husband
Co  For the husband who has not faith is made holy through his Christian wife and the wife who is not a Christian is made holy through the brother if not your children would be unholy but now are they holy
Co  But if the one who is not a Christian has a desire to go away let it be so the brother or the sister in such a position is not forced to do one thing or the other but it is Gods pleasure that we may be at peace with one another
Co  For how may you be certain O wife that you will not be the cause of salvation to your husband or you O husband that you may not do the same for your wife
Co  Only as the Lord has given to a man and as is the purpose of God for him so let him go on living And these are my orders for all the churches
Co  If any man who is a Christian has had circumcision let him keep so and if any man who is a Christian has not had circumcision let him make no change
Co  Circumcision is nothing and its opposite is nothing but only doing the orders of God is of value
Co  Let every man keep the position in which he has been placed by God
Co  If you were a servant when you became a Christian let it not be a grief to you but if you have a chance to become free make use of it
Co  For he who was a servant when he became a Christian is the Lords free man and he who was free when he became a Christian is the Lords servant
Co  It is the Lord who has made payment for you be not servants of men
Co  My brothers let every man keep in that condition which is the purpose of God for him
Co  Now about virgins I have no orders from the Lord but I give my opinion as one to whom the Lord has given mercy to be true to him
Co  In my opinion then because of the present trouble it is good for a man to keep as he is
Co  If you are married to a wife make no attempt to get free from her if you are free from a wife do not take a wife
Co  If you get married it is not a sin and if an unmarried woman gets married it is not a sin But those who do so will have trouble in the flesh But I will not be hard on you
Co  But I say this my brothers the time is short and from now it will be wise for those who have wives to be as if they had them not
Co  And for those who are in sorrow to give no signs of it and for those who are glad to give no signs of joy and for those who are getting property to be as if they had nothing
Co  And for those who make use of the world not to be using it fully for this worlds way of life will quickly come to an end
Co  But it is my desire for you to be free from cares The unmarried man gives his mind to the things of the Lord how he may give pleasure to the Lord
Co  But the married man gives his attention to the things of this world how he may give pleasure to his wife
Co  And the wife is not the same as the virgin The virgin gives her mind to the things of the Lord so that she may be holy in body and in spirit but the married woman takes thought for the things of the world how she may give pleasure to her husband
Co  Now I say this for your profit not to make things hard for you but because of what is right and so that you may be able to give all your attention to the things of the Lord
Co  But if in any mans opinion he is not doing what is right for his virgin if she is past her best years and there is need for it let him do what seems right to him it is no sin let them be married
Co  But the man who is strong in mind and purpose who is not forced but has control over his desires does well if he comes to the decision to keep her a virgin
Co  So then he who gets married to his virgin does well and he who keeps her unmarried does better
Co  It is right for a wife to be with her husband as long as he is living but when her husband is dead she is free to be married to another but only to a Christian
Co  But it will be better for her to keep as she is in my opinion and it seems to me that I have the Spirit of God
Co  Now about things offered to images we all seem to ourselves to have knowledge Knowledge gives pride but love gives true strength
Co  If anyone seems to himself to have knowledge so far he has not the right sort of knowledge about anything
Co  But if anyone has love for God God has knowledge of him
Co  So then as to the question of taking food offered to images we are certain that an image is nothing in the world and that there is no God but one
Co  For though there are those who have the name of gods in heaven or on earth as there are a number of gods and a number of lords
Co  There is for us only one God the Father of whom are all things and we are for him and one Lord Jesus Christ through whom are all things and we have our being through him
Co  Still all men have not that knowledge but some being used till now to the image are conscious that they are taking food which has been offered to the image and because they are not strong in the faith their minds are troubled
Co  But Gods approval of us is not based on the food we take if we do not take it we are no worse for it and if we take it we are no better
Co  But take care that this power of yours does not give cause for trouble to the feeble
Co  For if a man sees you who have knowledge taking food as a guest in the house of an image will it not give him if he is feeble the idea that he may take food offered to images
Co  And so through your knowledge you are the cause of destruction to your brother for whom Christ underwent death
Co  And in this way doing evil to the brothers and causing trouble to those whose faith is feeble you are sinning against Christ
Co  For this reason if food is a cause of trouble to my brother I will give up taking meat for ever so that I may not be a cause of trouble to my brother
Co  Am I not free am I not an Apostle have I not seen Jesus our Lord are you not my work in the Lord
Co  If to others I am not an Apostle at least I am one to you for the fact that you are Christians is the sign that I am an Apostle
Co  My answer to those who are judging me is this
Co  Have we no right to take food and drink
Co  Have we no right to take about with us a Christian wife like the rest of the Apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas
Co  Or I only and Barnabas have we no right to take a rest from work
Co  Who ever goes to war without looking to someone to be responsible for his payment who puts in vines and does not take the fruit of them or who takes care of sheep without drinking of their milk
Co  Am I talking as a man does not the law say the same
Co  For it says in the law of Moses It is not right to keep the ox from taking the grain when he is crushing it Is it for the oxen that God is giving orders
Co  Or has he us in mind Yes it was said for us because it is right for the ploughman to do his ploughing in hope and for him who is crushing the grain to do his work hoping for a part in the fruits of it
Co  If we have been planting the things of the Spirit for you does it seem a great thing for you to give us a part in your things of this world
Co  If others have a part in this right over you have we not even more But we did not make use of our right so that we might put nothing in the way of the good news of Christ
Co  Do you not see that the servants of the holy things get their living from the Temple and the servants of the altar have their part in the food which is offered on the altar
Co  Even so did the Lord give orders that the preachers of the good news might get their living from the good news
Co  But I have not made use of any of these things and I am not writing this in the hope that it may be so for me for it would be better for me to undergo death than for any man to make this pride of mine of no effect
Co  For if I am a preacher of the good news I have no cause for pride in this because I am forced to do so for a curse is on me if I do not
Co  But if I do it gladly I have a reward and if not I am under orders to do it
Co  What then is my reward This that when I am giving the good news I may give it without payment not making use of my rights as a preacher of the good news
Co  For though I was free from all men I made myself a servant to all so that more might have salvation
Co  And to the Jews I was as a Jew so that I might give the good news to them to those under the law I was the same not as being myself under the law but so that I might give the good news to those under the law
Co  To those without the law I was as one without the law not as being without law to God but as under law to Christ so that I might give the good news to those without the law
Co  To the feeble I was as one who is feeble so that they might have salvation I have been all things to all men so that some at least might have salvation
Co  And I do all things for the cause of the good news so that I may have a part in it
Co  Do you not see that in a running competition all take part but only one gets the reward So let your minds be fixed on the reward
Co  And every man who takes part in the sports has selfcontrol in all things Now they do it to get a crown which is of this world but we for an eternal crown
Co  So then I am running not uncertainly so I am fighting not as one who gives blows in the air
Co  But I give blows to my body and keep it under control for fear that after having given the good news to others I myself might not have Gods approval
Co  For it is my desire my brothers that you may keep in mind how all our fathers were under the cloud and they all went through the sea
Co  And they all had baptism from Moses in the cloud and in the sea
Co  And they all took the same holy food
Co  And the same holy drink for they all took of the water from the holy rock which came after them and the rock was Christ
Co  But with most of them God was not pleased for they came to their end in the waste land
Co  Now these things were for an example to us so that our hearts might not go after evil things as they did
Co  Then do not go after false gods as some of them did as it is said in the holy Writings After resting and feasting the people got up to take their pleasure
Co  Again let us not give way to the desires of the flesh as some of them did of whom twentythree thousand came to their end in one day
Co  And let us not put the Lord to the test as some of them did and came to their death by snakes
Co  And do not say evil things against the Lord as some of them did and destruction overtook them
Co  Now these things were done as an example and were put down in writing for our teaching on whom the last days have come
Co  So let him who seems to himself to be safe go in fear of a fall
Co  You have been put to no test but such as is common to man and God is true who will not let any test come on you which you are not able to undergo but he will make with the test a way out of it so that you may be able to go through it
Co  For this cause my dear brothers give no worship to false gods
Co  What I am saying is for wise men do you be the judges of it
Co  The cup of blessing which we take does it not give us a part in the blood of Christ and is not the broken bread a taking part in the body of Christ
Co  Because we being a number of persons are one bread we are one body for we all take part in the one bread
Co  See Israel after the flesh do not those who take as food the offerings of the altar take a part in the altar
Co  Do I say then that what is offered to images is anything or that the image is anything
Co  What I say is that the things offered by the Gentiles are offered to evil spirits and not to God and it is not my desire for you to have any part with evil spirits
Co  It is not possible for you at the same time to take the cup of the Lord and the cup of evil spirits you may not take part in the table of the Lord and the table of evil spirits
Co  Or may we be the cause of envy to the Lord are we stronger than he
Co  We are free to do all things but there are things which it is not wise to do We are free to do all things but not all things are for the common good
Co  Let a man give attention not only to what is good for himself but equally to his neighbours good
Co  Whatever meat may be had at the public market take as food without question of right or wrong
Co  For the earth is the Lords and all things in it
Co  If a Gentile makes a feast for you and you are pleased to go as a guest take whatever is put before you without question of right or wrong
Co  But if anyone says to you This food has been used as an offering do not take it on account of him who said it and on account of his sense of right and wrong
Co  Right and wrong I say not for you but for the other man for the fact that I am free is not dependent on another mans sense of right or wrong
Co  But if I give praise to God for the food which I take let no man say evil of me for that reason
Co  So then if it is a question of food or drink or any other thing whatever you do do all to the glory of God
Co  Give no cause of trouble to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God
Co  Even as I give way to all men in all things not looking for profit for myself but for the good of others that they may get salvation
Co  So take me for your example even as I take Christ for mine
Co  Now I am pleased to see that you keep me in memory in all things and that you give attention to the teaching which was handed down from me to you
Co  But it is important for you to keep this fact in mind that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God
Co  Every man who takes part in prayer or gives teaching as a prophet with his head covered puts shame on his head
Co  But every woman who does so with her head unveiled puts shame on her head for it is the same as if her hair was cut off
Co  For if a woman is not veiled let her hair be cut off but if it is a shame to a woman to have her hair cut off let her be veiled
Co  For it is not right for a man to have his head covered because he is the image and glory of God but the woman is the glory of the man
Co  For the man did not come from the woman but the woman from the man
Co  And the man was not made for the woman but the woman for the man
Co  For this reason it is right for the woman to have a sign of authority on her head because of the angels
Co  But the woman is not separate from the man and the man is not separate from the woman in the Lord
Co  For as the woman is from the man so the man is through the woman but all things are from God
Co  Be judges yourselves of the question does it seem right for a woman to take part in prayer unveiled
Co  Does it not seem natural to you that if a man has long hair it is a cause of shame to him
Co  But if a woman has long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given to her for a covering
Co  But if any man will not be ruled in this question this is not our way of doing things and it is not done in the churches of God
Co  But in giving you this order there is one thing about which I am not pleased it is that when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse
Co  For first of all it has come to my ears that when you come together in the church there are divisions among you and I take the statement to be true in part
Co  For divisions are necessary among you in order that those who have Gods approval may be clearly seen among you
Co  But now when you come together it is not possible to take the holy meal of the Lord
Co  For when you take your food everyone takes his meal before the other and one has not enough food and another is the worse for drink
Co  What have you not houses to take your meals in or have you no respect for the church of God putting the poor to shame What am I to say to you am I to give you praise certainly not
Co  For it was handed down to me from the Lord as I gave it to you that the Lord Jesus on the night when Judas was false to him took bread
Co  And when it had been broken with an act of praise he said This is my body which is for you do this in memory of me
Co  In the same way with the cup after the meal he said This cup is the new testament in my blood do this whenever you take it in memory of me
Co  For whenever you take the bread and the cup you give witness to the Lords death till he comes
Co  If then anyone takes the bread or the cup of the Lord in the wrong spirit he will be responsible for the body and blood of the Lord
Co  But let no man take of the bread and the cup without testing himself
Co  For a man puts himself in danger if he takes part in the holy meal without being conscious that it is the Lords body
Co  For this cause a number of you are feeble and ill and a number are dead
Co  But if we were true judges of ourselves punishment would not come on us
Co  But if punishment does come it is sent by the Lord so that we may be safe when the world is judged
Co  So then my brothers when you come together to the holy meal of the Lord let there be waiting for one another
Co  If any man is in need of food let him take his meal in his house so that you may not come together to your damage And the rest I will put in order when I come
Co  But about the things of the spirit my brothers it is not right for you to be without teaching
Co  You are conscious that when you were Gentiles in whatever way you were guided you went after images without voice or power
Co  So it is my desire for you to be clear about this that no one is able to say by the Spirit of God that Jesus is cursed and no one is able to say that Jesus is Lord but by the Holy Spirit
Co  Now there are different qualities given to men but the same Spirit
Co  And there are different sorts of servants but the same Lord
Co  And there are different operations but the same God who is working all things in all
Co  But to every man some form of the Spirits working is given for the common good
Co  For to one are given words of wisdom through the Spirit and to another words of knowledge through the same Spirit
Co  To another faith in the same Spirit and to another the power of taking away disease by the one Spirit
Co  And to another the power of working wonders and to another the prophets word and to another the power of testing spirits to another different sorts of tongues and to another the power of making clear the sense of the tongues
Co  But all these are the operations of the one and the same Spirit giving to every man separately as his pleasure is
Co  For as the body is one and has a number of parts and all the parts make one body so is Christ
Co  For through the baptism of the one Spirit we were all formed into one body Jews or Greeks servants or free men and were all made full of the same Spirit
Co  For the body is not one part but a number of parts
Co  If the foot says Because I am not the hand I am not a part of the body it is no less a part of the body
Co  And if the ear says Because I am not the eye I am not a part of the body it is a part of the body all the same
Co  If all the body was an eye where would be the hearing if all was hearing where would be the smelling
Co  But now God has put every one of the parts in the body as it was pleasing to him
Co  And if they were all one part where would the body be
Co  But now they are all different parts but one body
Co  And the eye may not say to the hand I have no need of you or again the head to the feet I have no need of you
Co  No those parts which seem to be feeble are the more necessary
Co  And to those parts of the body which seem to have less honour we give all the more honour and to those parts of the body which are a cause of shame to us we give the greater respect
Co  But those parts of the body which are beautiful have no need of such care and so the body has been joined together by God in such a way as to give more honour to those parts which had need of it
Co  So that there might be no division in the body but all the parts might have the same care for one another
Co  And if there is pain in one part of the body all the parts will be feeling it or if one part is honoured all the parts will be glad
Co  Now you are the body of Christ and every one of you the separate parts of it
Co  And God has put some in the church first Apostles second prophets third teachers then those with wonderworking powers then those with the power of taking away disease helpers wise guides users of strange tongues
Co  Are all Apostles are all prophets are all teachers have all the power of working wonders
Co  Are all able to take away disease have all the power of tongues are all able to give their sense
Co  But let your desires be turned to the more important things given by the Spirit And now I am pointing out to you an even better way
Co  If I make use of the tongues of men and of angels and have not love I am like sounding brass or a loudtongued bell
Co  And if I have a prophets power and have knowledge of all secret things and if I have all faith by which mountains may be moved from their place but have not love I am nothing
Co  And if I give all my goods to the poor and if I give my body to be burned but have not love it is of no profit to me
Co  Love is never tired of waiting love is kind love has no envy love has no high opinion of itself love has no pride
Co  Loves ways are ever fair it takes no thought for itself it is not quickly made angry it takes no account of evil
Co  It takes no pleasure in wrongdoing but has joy in what is true
Co  Love has the power of undergoing all things having faith in all things hoping all things
Co  Though the prophets word may come to an end tongues come to nothing and knowledge have no more value love has no end
Co  For our knowledge is only in part and the prophets word gives only a part of what is true
Co  But when that which is complete is come then that which is in part will be no longer necessary
Co  When I was a child I made use of a childs language I had a childs feelings and a childs thoughts now that I am a man I have put away the things of a child
Co  For now we see things in a glass darkly but then face to face now my knowledge is in part then it will be complete even as Gods knowledge of me
Co  But now we still have faith hope love these three and the greatest of these is love
Co  Go after love still desiring to have the things which the Spirit gives but most of all that you may have the prophets power
Co  For he who makes use of tongues is not talking to men but to God because no one has the sense of what he is saying but in the Spirit he is talking of secret things
Co  But the word of the prophet gives men knowledge and comfort and strength
Co  He who makes use of tongues may do good to himself but he who gives the prophets word does good to the church
Co  Now though it is my desire for you all to have the power of tongues it would give me more pleasure to be hearing the prophets word from you for this is a greater thing than using tongues if the sense is not given at the same time for the good of the church
Co  But now my brothers if I come to you using tongues what profit will it be to you if I do not give you a revelation or knowledge or the word of the prophet or teaching
Co  Even things without life having a voice such as a musicpipe or other instrument if they do not give out different sounds who may be certain what is being played
Co  For if the warhorn gives out an uncertain note who will get ready for the fight
Co  So if you in using a strange tongue say words which have no sense how will anyone take in what you are saying for you will be talking to the air
Co  There are it may be a number of different voices in the world and no voice is without sense
Co  But if the sense of the voice is not clear to me I am like a man from a strange country to him who is talking and he will be the same to me
Co  So if you are desiring the things which the Spirit gives let your minds be turned first to the things which are for the good of the church
Co  For this reason let the man who has the power of using tongues make request that he may at the same time be able to give the sense
Co  For if I make use of tongues in my prayers my spirit makes the prayer but not my mind
Co  What then let my prayer be from the spirit and equally from the mind let my song be from the spirit and equally from mind
Co  For if you give a blessing with the spirit how will the man who has no knowledge say So be it after your prayer seeing that he has not taken in what you are saying
Co  For your giving of the blessing is certainly well done but of no profit to the man without knowledge
Co  I give praise to God that I am able to make use of tongues more than you all
Co  But in the church it would be better for me to make use of five words of which the sense was clear so that others might have profit than ten thousand words in a strange tongue
Co  My brothers do not be children in mind in evil be as little children but in mind be of full growth
Co  In the law it is said By men of other tongues and by strange lips will my words come to this people and not even so will they give ear to me says the Lord
Co  For this reason tongues are for a sign not to those who have faith but to those who have not but the prophets word is for those who have faith and not for the rest who have not
Co  If then the church has come together and all are using tongues and there come in men without knowledge or faith will they not say that you are unbalanced
Co  But if all are teaching as prophets and a man without faith or knowledge comes in he is tested by all he is judged by all
Co  The secrets of his heart are made clear and he will go down on his face and give worship to God saying that God is truly among you
Co  What is it then my brothers when you come together everyone has a holy song or a revelation or a tongue or is giving the sense of it Let everything be done for the common good
Co  If any man makes use of a tongue let it not be more than two or at the most three and in turn and let someone give the sense
Co  But if there is no one to give the sense let him keep quiet in the church and let his words be to himself and to God
Co  And let the prophets give their words but not more than two or three and let the others be judges of what they say
Co  But if a revelation is given to another who is seated near let the first be quiet
Co  For you may all be prophets in turn so that all may get knowledge and comfort
Co  And the spirits of the prophets are controlled by the prophets
Co  For God is not a God whose ways are without order but a God of peace as in all the churches of the saints
Co  Let women keep quiet in the churches for it is not right for them to be talking but let them be under control as it says in the law
Co  And if they have a desire for knowledge about anything let them put questions to their husbands privately for talking in the church puts shame on a woman
Co  What was it from you that the word of God went out or did it only come in to you
Co  If any man seems to himself to be a prophet or to have the Spirit let him take note of the things which I am writing to you as being the word of the Lord
Co  But if any man is without knowledge let him be so
Co  So then my brothers let it be your chief desire to be prophets but let no one be stopped from using tongues
Co  Let all things be done in the right and ordered way
Co  Now I am going to make clear to you my brothers what the good news was which I gave to you and which you took and on which your faith is based
Co  By which you have salvation that is to say the form in which it was given to you if it is fixed in your minds and if your faith in it is not without effect
Co  For I gave to you first of all what was handed down to me how Christ underwent death for our sins as it says in the Writings
Co  And he was put in the place of the dead and on the third day he came back from the dead as it says in the Writings
Co  And he was seen by Cephas then by the twelve
Co  Then by more than five hundred brothers at the same time most of whom are still living but some are sleeping
Co  Then he was seen by James then by all the Apostles
Co  And last of all as by one whose birth was out of the right time he was seen by me
Co  For I am the least of the Apostles having no right to be named an Apostle because of my cruel attacks on the church of God
Co  But by the grace of God I am what I am and his grace which was given to me has not been for nothing for I did more work than all of them though not I but the grace of God which was with me
Co  If then it is I who am the preacher or they this is our word and to this you have given your faith
Co  Now if the good news says that Christ came back from the dead how do some of you say that there is no coming back from the dead
Co  But if there is no coming back from the dead then Christ has not come back from the dead
Co  And if Christ did not come again from the dead then our good news and your faith in it are of no effect
Co  Yes and we are seen to be false witnesses of God because we gave witness of God that by his power Christ came again from the dead which is not true if there is no coming back from the dead
Co  For if it is not possible for the dead to come to life again then Christ has not come to life again
Co  And if that is so your faith is of no effect you are still in your sins
Co  And in addition the dead in Christ have gone to destruction
Co  If in this life only we have hope in Christ we are of all men most unhappy
Co  But now Christ has truly come back from the dead the firstfruits of those who are sleeping
Co  For as by man came death so by man there is a coming back from the dead
Co  For as in Adam death comes to all so in Christ will all come back to life
Co  But every man in his right order Christ the firstfruits then those who are Christs at his coming
Co  Then comes the end when he will give up the kingdom to God even the Father when he will have put an end to all rule and to all authority and power
Co  For his rule will go on till he has put all those who are against him under his feet
Co  The last power to come to an end is death
Co  For as it says He has put all things under his feet But when he says All things are put under him it is clear that it is not said about him who put all things under him
Co  And when all things have been put under him then will the Son himself be under him who put all things under him so that God may be all in all
Co  Again what will they do who are given baptism for the dead if the dead do not come back at all why are people given baptism for them
Co  And why are we in danger every hour
Co  Yes truly by your pride in me my brothers in Christ Jesus our Lord my life is one long death
Co  If after the way of men I was fighting with beasts at Ephesus what profit is it to me If the dead do not come to life again let us take our pleasure in feasting for tomorrow we come to an end
Co  Do not be tricked by false words evil company does damage to good behaviour
Co  Be awake to righteousness and keep yourselves from sin for some have no knowledge of God I say this to put you to shame
Co  But someone will say How do the dead come back and with what sort of body do they come
Co  Foolish man it is necessary for the seed which you put into the earth to undergo death in order that it may come to life again
Co  And when you put it into the earth you do not put in the body which it will be but only the seed of grain or some other sort of plant
Co  But God gives it a body as it is pleasing to him and to every seed its special body
Co  All flesh is not the same flesh but there is one flesh of men another of beasts another of birds and another of fishes
Co  And there are bodies of heaven and bodies of earth but the glory of the one is different from that of the other
Co  There is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars for the glory of one star is different from that of another
Co  So is it with the coming back from the dead It is planted in death it comes again in life
Co  It is planted in shame it comes again in glory feeble when it is planted it comes again in power
Co  It is planted a natural body it comes again as a body of the spirit If there is a natural body there is equally a body of the spirit
Co  And so it is said The first man Adam was a living soul The last Adam is a lifegiving spirit
Co  But that which is natural comes before that which is of the spirit
Co  The first man is from the earth and of the earth the second man is from heaven
Co  Those who are of the earth are like the man who was from the earth and those who are of heaven are like the one from heaven
Co  And in the same way as we have taken on us the image of the man from the earth so we will take on us the image of the one from heaven
Co  Now I say this my brothers that it is not possible for flesh and blood to have a part in the kingdom of God and death may not have a part in life
Co  See I am giving you the revelation of a secret we will not all come to the sleep of death but we will all be changed
Co  In a second in the shutting of an eye at the sound of the last horn for at that sound the dead will come again free for ever from the power of death and we will be changed
Co  For this body which comes to destruction will be made free from the power of death and the man who is under the power of death will put on eternal life
Co  But when this has taken place then that which was said in the Writings will come true Death is overcome by life
Co  O death where is your power O death where are your pains
Co  The pain of death is sin and the power of sin is the law
Co  But praise be to God who gives us strength to overcome through our Lord Jesus Christ
Co  For this cause my dear brothers be strong in purpose and unmoved ever giving yourselves to the work of the Lord because you are certain that your work is not without effect in the Lord
Co  Now about the giving of money for the saints as I gave orders to the churches of Galatia so do you
Co  On the first day of the week let every one of you put by him in store in measure as he has done well in business so that it may not be necessary to get money together when I come
Co  And when I come I will send the men of your selection with letters to take the money you have got together to Jerusalem
Co  And if it is possible for me to go there they will go with me
Co  But I will come to you after I have gone through Macedonia for that is my purpose
Co  But I may be with you for a time or even for the winter so that you may see me on my way wherever I go
Co  For it is not my desire to see you now on my way because it is my hope to be with you for some time if that is the Lords pleasure
Co  But I will be at Ephesus till Pentecost
Co  For a great and important door there is open to me and there are a number of people against me
Co  Now if Timothy comes see that he is with you without fear because he is doing the Lords work even as I am
Co  See then that he has the honour which is right But send him on his way in peace so that he may come to me for I am looking for him with the brothers
Co  But as for Apollos the brother I had a great desire for him to come to you with the brothers but it was not his pleasure to come now but he will come when he has a chance
Co  Be on the watch unmoved in the faith and be strong like men
Co  Let all you do be done in love
Co  Now I make my request to you my brothers for you have knowledge that the house of Stephanas is the firstfruits of Achaia and that they have made themselves the servants of the saints
Co  That you put yourselves under such and under everyone who is helping the Lords work
Co  And I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus for they have done what was needed to make your work complete
Co  For they gave comfort to my spirit and to yours for which cause give respect to such people
Co  The churches of Asia send their love to you So do Aquila and Prisca with the church which is in their house
Co  All the brothers send their love to you Give one another a holy kiss
Co  I Paul send you these words of love in my writing
Co  If any man has not love for the Lord let him be cursed Maran atha our Lord comes
Co  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you
Co  My love be with you all in Christ Jesus So be it
Co  Paul an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the purpose of God and Timothy the brother to the church of God which is in Corinth with all the saints who are in all Achaia
Co  Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
Co  Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort
Co  Who gives us comfort in all our troubles so that we may be able to give comfort to others who are in trouble through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God
Co  For as we undergo more of the pain which Christ underwent so through Christ does our comfort become greater
Co  But if we are troubled it is for your comfort and salvation or if we are comforted it is for your comfort which takes effect through your quiet undergoing of the same troubles which we undergo
Co  And our hope for you is certain in the knowledge that as you take part in the troubles so you will take part in the comfort
Co  For it is our desire that you may not be without knowledge of our trouble which came on us in Asia that the weight of it was very great more than our power so that it seemed that we had no hope even of life
Co  Yes we ourselves have had the answer of death in ourselves so that our hope might not be in ourselves but in God who is able to give life to the dead
Co  Who gave us salvation from so great a death on whom we have put our hope that he will still go on to give us salvation
Co  You at the same time helping together by your prayer for us so that for what has been given to us through a number of persons praise may go up to God for us from all of them
Co  For our glory is in this in the knowledge which we have that our way of life in the world and most of all in relation to you has been holy and true in the eyes of God not in the wisdom of the flesh but in the grace of God
Co  For in our letters we say no other things to you but those which you are reading and to which you give agreement and it is my hope will go on doing so to the end
Co  Even as you have been ready in part to say that we are your glory in the same way that you are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus
Co  And being certain of this it was my purpose to come to you before so that you might have a second grace
Co  And by way of Corinth to go into Macedonia and from there to come back again to you so that you might send me on my way to Judaea
Co  If then I had such a purpose did I seem to be changing suddenly or am I guided in my purposes by the flesh saying Yes today and No tomorrow
Co  As God is true our word to you is not Yes and No
Co  For the Son of God Jesus Christ whom we were preaching among you even I and Silvanus and Timothy was not Yes and No but in him is Yes
Co  For he is the Yes to all the undertakings of God and by him all the words of God are made certain and put into effect to the glory of God through us
Co  Now he who makes our faith strong together with you in Christ and has given us of his grace is God
Co  And it is he who has put his stamp on us even the Spirit as the sign in our hearts of the coming glory
Co  But God is my witness that it was in pity for you that I did not come to Corinth at that time
Co  Not that we have authority over your faith but we are helpers of your joy for it is faith which is your support
Co  But it was my decision for myself not to come again to you with sorrow
Co  For if I give you sorrow who then will make me glad but he who is made sad by me
Co  And I said this very thing in my letter for fear that when I came I might have sorrow from those from whom it was right for me to have joy being certain of this that my joy is the joy of you all
Co  For out of much trouble and pain of heart and much weeping I sent my letter to you not to give you sorrow but so that you might see how great is the love which I have to you
Co  But if anyone has been a cause of sorrow he has been so not to me only but in some measure to all of you I say this that I may not be overhard on you
Co  Let it be enough for such a man to have undergone the punishment which the church put on him
Co  So that now on the other hand it is right for him to have forgiveness and comfort from you for fear that his sorrow may be overgreat
Co  For which cause my desire is that you will make your love to him clear by your acts
Co  And for the same reason I sent you a letter so that I might be certain of your desire to do my orders in all things
Co  But if you give forgiveness to anyone I do the same for if I have given forgiveness for anything I have done it because of you in the person of Christ
Co  So that Satan may not get the better of us for we are not without knowledge of his designs
Co  Now when I came to Troas for the good news of Christ and there was an open door for me in the Lord
Co  I had no rest in my spirit because Titus my brother was not there so I went away from them and came into Macedonia
Co  But praise be to God who makes us strong to overcome in Christ and makes clear through us in every place the value of the knowledge of him
Co  For we are a sweet perfume of Christ to God in those who are getting salvation and in those who are going to destruction
Co  To the one it is a perfume of death to death to the other a perfume of life to life And who is enough for such things
Co  For we are not like the great number who make use of the word of God for profit but our words are true as from God being said as before God in Christ
Co  Do we seem to be again attempting to put ourselves in the right or have we need as some have of letters of approval to you or from you
Co  You yourselves are our letter whose writing is in our heart open for every mans reading and knowledge
Co  For you are clearly a letter of Christ the fruit of our work recorded not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God not in stone but in hearts of flesh
Co  And this is the certain faith which we have in God through Christ
Co  Not as if we were able by ourselves to do anything for which we might take the credit but our power comes from God
Co  Who has made us able to be servants of a new agreement not of the letter but of the Spirit for the letter gives death but the Spirit gives life
Co  For if the operation of the law giving death recorded in letters on stone came with glory so that the eyes of the children of Israel had to be turned away from the face of Moses because of its glory a glory which was only for a time
Co  Will not the operation of the Spirit have a much greater glory
Co  For if the operation of the law producing punishment had its glory how much greater will be the operation of the Spirit causing righteousness
Co  For the glory of the first no longer seems to be glory because of the greater glory of that which comes after
Co  For if the order which was for a time had its glory much more will the eternal order have its glory
Co  Having then such a hope we keep nothing back
Co  And are not like Moses who put a veil on his face so that the children of Israel might not see clearly to the end of the present order of things
Co  But their minds were made hard for to this very day at the reading of the old agreement the same veil is still unlifted though it is taken away in Christ
Co  But to this day at the reading of the law of Moses a veil is over their heart
Co  But when it is turned to the Lord the veil will be taken away
Co  Now the Lord is the Spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is there the heart is free
Co  But we all with unveiled face giving back as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as from the Lord who is the Spirit
Co  For this reason because we have been made servants of this new order through the mercy given to us we are strong
Co  And we have given up the secret things of shame not walking in false ways and not making use of the word of God with deceit but by the revelation of what is true as before God we have the approval of every mans sense of right and wrong
Co  But if our good news is veiled it is veiled from those who are on the way to destruction
Co  Because the god of this world has made blind the minds of those who have not faith so that the light of the good news of the glory of Christ who is the image of God might not be shining on them
Co  For our preaching is not about ourselves but about Christ Jesus as Lord and ourselves as your servants through Jesus
Co  Seeing that it is God who said Let light be shining out of the dark who has put in our hearts the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ
Co  But we have this wealth in vessels of earth so that it may be seen that the power comes not from us but from God
Co  Troubles are round us on every side but we are not shut in things are hard for us but we see a way out of them
Co  We are cruelly attacked but not without hope we are made low but we are not without help
Co  In our bodies there is ever the mark of the death of Jesus so that the life of Jesus may be seen in our bodies
Co  For while living we are still being given up to death because of Jesus so that the life of Jesus may be seen in our flesh though it is under the power of death
Co  So then death is working in us but life in you
Co  But having the same spirit of faith as it is said in the Writings The words of my mouth came from the faith in my heart in the same way our words are the outcome of our faith
Co  Because we are certain that he who made the Lord Jesus come back from the dead will do the same for us and will give us a place in his glory with you
Co  For we go through all things on account of you because the greater the number to whom the grace is given the greater is the praise to the glory of God
Co  For which cause we do not give way to weariness but though our outer man is getting feebler our inner man is made new day by day
Co  For our present trouble which is only for a short time is working out for us a much greater weight of glory
Co  While our minds are not on the things which are seen but on the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are for a time but the things which are not seen are eternal
Co  For we are conscious that if this our tent of flesh is taken down we have a building from God a house not made with hands eternal in heaven
Co  For in this we are crying in weariness greatly desiring to be clothed with our house from heaven
Co  So that our spirits may not be unclothed
Co  For truly we who are in this tent do give out cries of weariness for the weight of care which is on us not because we are desiring to be free from the body but so that we may have our new body and death may be overcome by life
Co  Now he who has made us for this very thing is God who has given us the Spirit as a witness of what is to come
Co  So then we are ever without fear and though conscious that while we are in the body we are away from the Lord
Co  For we are walking by faith not by seeing
Co  We are without fear desiring to be free from the body and to be with the Lord
Co  For this reason we make it our purpose in the body or away from it to be wellpleasing to him
Co  For we all have to come before Christ to be judged so that every one of us may get his reward for the things done in the body good or bad
Co  Having in mind then the fear of the Lord we put these things before men but God sees our hearts and it is my hope that we may seem right in your eyes
Co  We are not again requesting your approval but we are giving you the chance of taking pride in us so that you may be able to give an answer to those whose glory is in seeming and not in the heart
Co  For if we are foolish it is to God or if we are serious it is for you
Co  For it is the love of Christ which is moving us because we are of the opinion that if one was put to death for all then all have undergone death
Co  And that he underwent death for all so that the living might no longer be living to themselves but to him who underwent death for them and came back from the dead
Co  For this reason from this time forward we have knowledge of no man after the flesh even if we have had knowledge of Christ after the flesh we have no longer any such knowledge
Co  So if any man is in Christ he is in a new world the old things have come to an end they have truly become new
Co  But all things are of God who has made us at peace with himself through Christ and has given to us the work of making peace
Co  That is that God was in Christ making peace between the world and himself not putting their sins to their account and having given to us the preaching of this news of peace
Co  So we are the representatives of Christ as if God was making a request to you through us we make our request to you in the name of Christ be at peace with God
Co  For him who had no knowledge of sin God made to be sin for us so that we might become the righteousness of God in him
Co  We then working together with God make our request to you not to take the grace of God to no purpose
Co  For he says I have given ear to you at a good time and I have been your helper in a day of salvation see now is the good time now is the day of salvation
Co  Giving no cause for trouble in anything so that no one may be able to say anything against our work
Co  But in everything making it clear that we are the servants of God in quiet strength in troubles in need in sorrow
Co  In blows in prisons in attacks in hard work in watchings in going without food
Co  In a clean heart in knowledge in long waiting in being kind in the Holy Spirit in true love
Co  In the true word in the power of God with the arms of righteousness on the right hand and on the left
Co  By glory and by shame by an evil name and a good name as untrue and still true
Co  Unnoted but still kept fully in mind as near to death but still living as undergoing punishment but not put to death
Co  As full of sorrow but ever glad as poor but giving wealth to others as having nothing but still having all things
Co  Our mouth is open to you O Corinthians our heart is wide
Co  It is not our feelings to you which are narrow but yours to us
Co  Now to give me back payment of the same sort I am talking as to my children let your hearts be wide open to me
Co  Do not keep company with those who have not faith for what is there in common between righteousness and evil or between light and dark
Co  And what agreement is there between Christ and the Evil One or what part has one who has faith with one who has not
Co  And what agreement has the house of God with images for we are a house of the living God even as God has said I will be living among them and walking with them and I will be their God and they will be my people
Co  For which cause Come out from among them and be separate says the Lord and let no unclean thing come near you and I will take you for myself
Co  And will be a Father to you and you will be my sons and daughters says the Lord the Ruler of all
Co  Because God then will give us such rewards dear brothers let us make ourselves clean from all evil of flesh and spirit and become completely holy in the fear of God
Co  Let your hearts be open to us we have done no man wrong no man has been damaged by us we have made no profit out of any man
Co  It is not with the purpose of judging you that I say this for I have said before that you are in our hearts for life and death together
Co  My words to you are without fear I am full of pride on account of you I have great comfort and joy in all our troubles
Co  For even when we had come into Macedonia our flesh had no rest but we were troubled on every side there were fightings outside and fears inside
Co  But God who gives comfort to the poor in spirit gave us comfort by the coming of Titus
Co  And not by his coming only but by the comfort which he had in you while he gave us word of your desire your sorrow your care for me so that I was still more glad
Co  For though my letter gave you pain I have no regret for it now though I had before for I see that the letter gave you pain but only for a time
Co  Now I am glad not that you had sorrow but that your sorrow was the cause of a change of heart for yours was a holy sorrow so that you might undergo no loss by us in anything
Co  For the sorrow which God gives is the cause of salvation through a change of heart in which there is no reason for grief but the sorrow of the world is a cause of death
Co  For you see what care was produced in you by this very sorrow of yours before God what clearing of yourselves what wrath against sin what fear what desire what serious purpose what punishment In everything you have made it clear that you are free from sin in this business
Co  So though I sent you a letter it was not only because of the man who did the wrong or because of him to whom the wrong was done but so that your true care for us might be made clear in the eyes of God
Co  So we have been comforted and we had the greater joy in our comfort because of the joy of Titus for his spirit had been made glad by you all
Co  For I was not put to shame in anything in which I may have made clear to him my pride in you but as we said nothing to you but what was true so the good things which I said to Titus about you were seen by him to be true
Co  And his love to you is the more increased by his memory of you all how you gave way to his authority and how you took him to your hearts with fear and honour
Co  It gives me great joy to see you answering to my good opinion of you in every way
Co  And now we give you news brothers about the grace of God which has been given to the churches of Macedonia
Co  How while they were undergoing every sort of trouble and were in the greatest need they took all the greater joy in being able to give freely to the needs of others
Co  For I give them witness that as they were able and even more than they were able they gave from the impulse of their hearts
Co  Seriously requesting us that they might have a part in this grace of being servants to the needs of the saints
Co  And going even farther than our hope they first gave themselves to the Lord and to us after the purpose of God
Co  So that we made a request to Titus that as he had made a start before so he might make this grace complete in you
Co  And that as you are full of every good thing of faith of the word of knowledge of a ready mind and of love to us so you may be full of this grace in the same way
Co  I am not giving you an order but using the ready mind of others as a test of the quality of your love
Co  For you see the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ how though he had wealth he became poor on your account so that through his need you might have wealth
Co  And in this I give my opinion for it is to your profit who were the first to make a start a year before not only to do this but to make clear that your minds were more than ready to do it
Co  Then make the doing of it complete so that as you had a ready mind you may give effect to it as you are able
Co  For if there is a ready mind a man will have Gods approval in the measure of what he has and not of what he has not
Co  And I am not saying this so that others may get off free while the weight comes on you
Co  But so that things may be equal that from those things of which you have more than enough at the present time their need may be helped and that if you are in any need they may be a help to you in the same way making things equal
Co  As it says in the Writings He who had taken up much had nothing over and he who had little had enough
Co  But praise be to God who puts the same care for you into the heart of Titus
Co  For while he gladly gave ear to our request he was interested enough to go to you from the impulse of his heart
Co  And with him we have sent a brother whose praise in the good news has gone through all the churches
Co  And not only so but he was marked out by the churches to go with us in the grace of this giving which we have undertaken to the glory of the Lord and to make clear that our mind was ready
Co  And so that no man might be able to say anything against us in the business of this giving which has been put into our hands
Co  For the business has been so ordered by us as to have the approval not only of the Lord but of men
Co  And we have sent with them our brother whose ready spirit has been made clear to us at times and in ways without number but it is now all the more so because of the certain faith which he has in you
Co  If any question comes up about Titus he is my brotherworker working with me for you or about the others they are the representatives of the churches to the glory of Christ
Co  Make clear then to them as representatives of the churches the quality of your love and that the things which we have said about you are true
Co  But there is no need for me to say anything in my letter about the giving to the saints
Co  For I have before made clear to those of Macedonia my pride in your ready mind saying to them that Achaia has been ready for a year back and a great number have been moved to do the same by your example
Co  But I have sent the brothers so that the good things we said about you may be seen to be true and that as I said you may be ready
Co  For fear that if any from Macedonia come with me and you are not ready we not to say you might be put to shame in this thing
Co  So it seemed to me wise for the brothers to go before and see that the amount which you had undertaken to give was ready so that it might be a cause for praise and not as if we were making profit out of you
Co  But in the Writings it says He who puts in only a small number of seeds will get in the same and he who puts them in from a full hand will have produce in full measure from them
Co  Let every man do after the purpose of his heart not giving with grief or by force for God takes pleasure in a ready giver
Co  And God is able to give you all grace in full measure so that ever having enough of all things you may be full of every good work
Co  As it is said in the Writings He has sent out far and wide he has given to the poor his righteousness is for ever
Co  And he who gives seed for putting into the field and bread for food will take care of the growth of your seed at the same time increasing the fruits of your righteousness
Co  Your wealth being increased in everything with a simple mind causing praise to God through us
Co  For this work of giving not only takes care of the needs of the saints but is the cause of much praise to God
Co  For when through this work of giving they see what you are they give glory to God for the way in which you have given yourselves to the good news of Christ and for the wealth of your giving to them and to all
Co  While their hearts go out to you in love and in prayer for you because of the great grace of God which is in you
Co  Praise be to God for what he has given which words have no power to say
Co  Now I Paul myself make request to you by the quiet and gentle behaviour of Christ I who am poor in spirit when with you but who say what is in my mind to you without fear when I am away from you
Co  Yes I make my request to you so that when I am with you I may not have to make use of the authority which may be needed against some to whom we seem to be walking after the flesh
Co  For though we may be living in the flesh we are not fighting after the way of the flesh
Co  For the arms with which we are fighting are not those of the flesh but are strong before God for the destruction of high places
Co  Putting an end to reasonings and every high thing which is lifted up against the knowledge of God and causing every thought to come under the authority of Christ
Co  Being ready to give punishment to whatever is against his authority after you have made it clear that you are completely under his control
Co  Give attention to the things which are before you If any man seems to himself to be Christs let him keep in mind that we are as much Christs as he is
Co  For though I might take pride in our authority which the Lord gave for building you up and not for your destruction it will not be a cause of shame to me
Co  That I may not seem to have the desire of causing you fear by my letters
Co  For his letters they say have weight and are strong but in body he is feeble and his way of talking has little force
Co  Let those who say this keep in mind that what we are in word by letters when we are away so will we be in act when we are present
Co  For we will not make comparison of ourselves with some of those who say good things about themselves but these measuring themselves by themselves and making comparison of themselves with themselves are not wise
Co  We will not give glory to ourselves in overgreat measure but after the measure of the rule which God has given us a measure which comes even to you
Co  For we have no need to make ourselves seem more than we are as if our authority did not come as far as to you for we came even as far as you with the good news of Christ
Co  Not taking credit to ourselves for what is not our business that is for the work of others but having hope that with the growth of your faith we may get the credit for an increase which is the effect of our work
Co  So that we may be able to go on and take the good news to countries still farther away than you are and not take credit for another mans work in making things ready to our hand
Co  But whoever has a desire for glory let his glory be in the Lord
Co  For the Lords approval of a man is not dependent on his opinion of himself but on the Lords opinion of him
Co  Put up with me if I am a little foolish but truly you do put up with me
Co  For I have a very great care for you because you have been married by me to one husband and it is my desire to give you completely holy to Christ
Co  But I have a fear that in some way as Eve was tricked by the deceit of the snake your minds may be turned away from their simple and holy love for Christ
Co  For if anyone comes preaching another Jesus from the one whose preachers we are or if you have got a different spirit or a different sort of good news from those which came to you how well you put up with these things
Co  For in my opinion I am in no way less than the most important of the Apostles
Co  But though I am rough in my way of talking I am not so in knowledge as we have made clear to all by our acts among you
Co  Or did I do wrong in making myself low so that you might be lifted up because I gave you the good news of God without reward
Co  I took money from other churches as payment for my work so that I might be your servant
Co  And when I was present with you and was in need I let no man be responsible for me for the brothers when they came from Macedonia gave me whatever was needed and in everything I kept myself from being a trouble to you and I will go on doing so
Co  As the true word of Christ is in me I will let no man take from me this my cause of pride in the country of Achaia
Co  Why because I have no love for you let God be judge
Co  But what I do that I will go on doing so that I may give no chance to those who are looking for one so that in the cause of their pride they may be seen to be the same as we are
Co  For such men are false Apostles workers of deceit making themselves seem like Apostles of Christ
Co  And it is no wonder for even Satan himself is able to take the form of an angel of light
Co  So it is no great thing if his servants make themselves seem to be servants of righteousness whose end will be the reward of their works
Co  I say again Let me not seem foolish to anyone but if I do put up with me as such so that I may take a little glory to myself
Co  What I am now saying is not by the order of the Lord but as a foolish person taking credit to myself as it seems
Co  Seeing that there are those who take credit to themselves after the flesh I will do the same
Co  For you put up with the foolish gladly being wise yourselves
Co  You put up with a man if he makes servants of you if he makes profit out of you if he makes you prisoners if he puts himself in a high place if he gives you blows on the face
Co  I say this by way of shaming ourselves as if we had been feeble But if anyone puts himself forward I am talking like a foolish person I will do the same
Co  Are they Hebrews so am I Are they of Israel so am I Are they the seed of Abraham so am I
Co  Are they servants of Christ I am talking foolishly I am more so I have had more experience of hard work of prisons of blows more than measure of death
Co  Five times the Jews gave me forty blows but one
Co  Three times I was whipped with rods once I was stoned three times the ship I was in came to destruction at sea a night and a day I have been in the water
Co  In frequent travels in dangers on rivers in dangers from outlaws in dangers from my countrymen in dangers from the Gentiles in dangers in the town in dangers in the waste land in dangers at sea in dangers among false brothers
Co  In hard work and weariness in frequent watchings going without food and drink cold and in need of clothing
Co  In addition to all the other things there is that which comes on me every day the care of all the churches
Co  Who is feeble and I am not feeble who is in danger of falling and I am not angry
Co  If I have to take credit to myself I will do so in the things in which I am feeble
Co  The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ to whom be praise for ever is witness that the things which I say are true
Co  In Damascus the ruler under Aretas the king kept watch over the town of the people of Damascus in order to take me
Co  And being let down in a basket from the wall through a window I got free from his hands
Co  As it is necessary for me to take glory to myself though it is not a good thing I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord
Co  I have knowledge of a man in Christ fourteen years back if he was in the body or out of the body I am not able to say but God only who was taken up to the third heaven
Co  And I have knowledge of such a man if he was in the body or out of the body I am not able to say but God only
Co  How he was taken up into Paradise and words came to his ears which may not be said and which man is not able to say
Co  On account of such a one I will have glory for myself I will take no glory but only in my feeble body
Co  For if I had a desire to take credit to myself it would not be foolish for I would be saying what is true but I will not for fear that I might seem to any man more than he sees me to be or has word from me that I am
Co  And because the revelations were so very great in order that I might not be overmuch lifted up there was given to me a thorn in the flesh one sent from Satan to give me pain
Co  And about this thing I made request to the Lord three times that it might be taken away from me
Co  And he said to me My grace is enough for you for my power is made complete in what is feeble Most gladly then will I take pride in my feeble body so that the power of Christ may be on me
Co  So I take pleasure in being feeble in unkind words in needs in cruel attacks in troubles on account of Christ for when I am feeble then am I strong
Co  I have been forced by you to become foolish though it was right for my praise to have come from you for in no way was I less than the chief of the Apostles though I am nothing
Co  Truly the signs of an Apostle were done among you in quiet strength with wonders and acts of power
Co  For what is there in which you were made less than the other churches but in the one thing that I was not a trouble to you Let me have forgiveness for this wrong
Co  This is now the third time that I am ready to come to you and I will not be a trouble to you my desire is for you not for your property for it is not the childrens business to make store for their fathers but the fathers for the children
Co  And I will gladly give all I have for your souls If I have the more love for you am I to be loved the less
Co  But let it be so that I was not a trouble to you myself but someone may say being false I took you with deceit
Co  Did I make a profit out of you by any of those whom I sent to you
Co  I gave orders to Titus and I sent the brother with him Did Titus make any profit out of you were we not guided by the same Spirit in the same ways
Co  It may seem to you that all this time we have been attempting to put ourselves in the right but we are saying these things before God in Christ For all things dear brothers are for your profit
Co  For I have a fear that when I come you may not be answering to my desire and that I may not be answering to yours that there may be fighting hate angry feeling divisions evil talk about others secrets thoughts of pride outbursts against authority
Co  And that when I come again my God may put me to shame among you and I may have grief for those who have done wrong before and have had no regret for their unclean ways and for the evil desires of the flesh to which they have given way
Co  This is the third time that I am coming to you From the mouth of two or three witnesses will every word be made certain
Co  I said before and still say it before I come as being present for the second time though I am still away from you to those who have done wrong before and to all the others that if I come again I will not have pity
Co  Seeing that you are looking for a sign of Christ giving out his word in me who is not feeble in relation to you but is strong in you
Co  For he was feeble in that he was put to death on the cross but he is living by the power of God And we are feeble in him but we will be living with him through the power of God in relation to you
Co  Make a test of yourselves if you are in the faith make certain of yourselves Or are you not conscious in yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you if you are truly Christs
Co  But it is my hope that you will have no doubt that we are truly Christs
Co  Now our prayer to God is that you may do no evil not in order that it may be put to our credit but so that you may do what is right whatever we may seem
Co  Because we are able to do nothing against what is true but only for it
Co  For we are glad when we are feeble and you are strong and this is our prayer even that you may be made complete
Co  For this cause I am writing these things while I am away so that there may be need for me when I am present to make use of sharp measures by the authority which the Lord has given me for building up and not for destruction
Co  Let this be my last word brothers be glad be complete be comforted be of the same mind be at peace with one another and the God of love and peace will be with you
Co  Give one another a holy kiss
Co  All the saints send their love to you
Co  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the harmony of the Holy Spirit be with you all
Gal  Paul an Apostle not from men and not through man but through Jesus Christ and God the Father who made him come back from the dead
Gal  And all the brothers who are with me to the churches of Galatia
Gal  Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ
Gal  Who gave himself for our sins so that he might make us free from this present evil world after the purpose of our God and Father
Gal  To whom be the glory for ever and ever So be it
Gal  I am surprised that you are being so quickly turned away from him whose word came to you in the grace of Christ to good news of a different sort
Gal  Which is not another sort only there are some who give you trouble desiring to make changes in the good news of Christ
Gal  But even if we or an angel from heaven were to be a preacher to you of good news other than that which we have given you let there be a curse on him
Gal  As we have said before so say I now again If any man is a preacher to you of any good news other than that which has been given to you let there be a curse on him
Gal  Am I now using arguments to men or God or is it my desire to give men pleasure if I was still pleasing men I would not be a servant of Christ
Gal  Because I say to you my brothers that the good news of which I was the preacher is not mans
Gal  For I did not get it from man and I was not given teaching in it but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ
Gal  For news has come to you of my way of life in the past in the Jews religion how I was cruel without measure to the church of God and did great damage to it
Gal  And I went farther in the Jews religion than a number of my generation among my countrymen having a more burning interest in the beliefs handed down from my fathers
Gal  But when it was the good pleasure of God by whom I was marked out even from my mothers body through his grace
Gal  To give the revelation of his Son in me so that I might give the news of him to the Gentiles then I did not take the opinion of flesh and blood
Gal  And I went not up to Jerusalem to those who were Apostles before me but I went away into Arabia and again I came back to Damascus
Gal  Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Cephas and was there with him fifteen days
Gal  But of the other Apostles I saw only James the Lords brother
Gal  Now God is witness that the things which I am writing to you are true
Gal  Then I came to the parts of Syria and Cilicia
Gal  And the churches of Judaea which were in Christ still had no knowledge of my face or person
Gal  Only it came to their ears that he who at one time was cruel to us is now preaching the faith which before had been attacked by him
Gal  And they gave glory to God in me
Gal  Then after the space of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas taking Titus with me
Gal  And I went up by revelation and I put before them the good news which I was preaching among the Gentiles but privately before those who were of good name so that the work which I was or had been doing might not be without effect
Gal  But not even Titus who was with me being a Greek was made to undergo circumcision
Gal  And that because of the false brothers let in secretly who came searching out our free condition which we have in Christ Jesus so that they might make servants of us
Gal  To whom we gave way not even for an hour so that the true words of the good news might still be with you
Gal  But from those who seemed to be important whatever they were has no weight with me God does not take mans person into account those who seemed to be important gave nothing new to me
Gal  But quite the opposite when they saw that I had been made responsible for preaching the good news to those without circumcision even as Peter had been for those of the circumcision
Gal  Because he who was working in Peter as the Apostle of the circumcision was working no less in me among the Gentiles
Gal  When they saw the grace which was given to me James and Cephas and John who had the name of being pillars gave to me and Barnabas their right hands as friends so that we might go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcision
Gal  Only it was their desire that we would give thought to the poor which very thing I had much in mind to do
Gal  But when Cephas came to Antioch I made a protest against him to his face because he was clearly in the wrong
Gal  For before certain men came from James he did take food with the Gentiles but when they came he went back and made himself separate fearing those who were of the circumcision
Gal  And the rest of the Jews went after him so that even Barnabas was overcome by their false ways
Gal  But when I saw that they were not living uprightly in agreement with the true words of the good news I said to Cephas before them all If you being a Jew are living like the Gentiles and not like the Jews how will you make the Gentiles do the same as the Jews
Gal  We being Jews by birth and not sinners of the Gentiles
Gal  Being conscious that a man does not get righteousness by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ we had faith in Christ Jesus so that we might get righteousness by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law because by the works of the law will no flesh get righteousness
Gal  But if while we were desiring to get righteousness through Christ we ourselves were seen to be sinners is Christ a servant of sin In no way
Gal  For if I put up again those things which I gave to destruction I am seen to be a wrongdoer
Gal  For I through the law have become dead to the law so that I might be living to God
Gal  I have been put to death on the cross with Christ still I am living no longer I but Christ is living in me and that life which I now am living in the flesh I am living by faith the faith of the Son of God who in love for me gave himself up for me
Gal  I do not make the grace of God of no effect because if righteousness is through the law then Christ was put to death for nothing
Gal  O foolish Galatians by what strange powers have you been tricked to whom it was made clear that Jesus Christ was put to death on the cross
Gal  Give me an answer to this one question Did the Spirit come to you through the works of the law or by the hearing of faith
Gal  Are you so foolish having made a start in the Spirit will you now be made complete in the flesh
Gal  Did you undergo such a number of things to no purpose if it is in fact to no purpose
Gal  He who gives you the Spirit and does works of power among you is it by the works of law or by the hearing of faith
Gal  Even as Abraham had faith in God and it was put to his account as righteousness
Gal  Be certain then that those who are of faith the same are sons of Abraham
Gal  And the holy Writings seeing before the event that God would give the Gentiles righteousness by faith gave the good news before to Abraham saying In you will all the nations have a blessing
Gal  So then those who are of faith have a part in the blessing of Abraham who was full of faith
Gal  For all who are of the works of the law are under a curse because it is said in the Writings A curse is on everyone who does not keep on doing all the things which are ordered in the book of the law
Gal  Now that no man gets righteousness by the law in the eyes of God is clear because The upright will be living by faith
Gal  And the law is not of faith but He who does them will have life by them
Gal  Christ has made us free from the curse of the law having become a curse for us because it is said in the Writings A curse on everyone who is put to death by hanging on a tree
Gal  So that on the Gentiles might come the blessing of Abraham in Christ Jesus in order that we through faith might have the Spirit which God had undertaken to give
Gal  Brothers as men would say even a mans agreement when it has been made certain may not be put on one side or have additions made to it
Gal  Now to Abraham were the undertakings given and to his seed He says not And to seeds as of a great number but as of one he says And to your seed which is Christ
Gal  Now this I say The law which came four hundred and thirty years after does not put an end to the agreement made before by God so as to make the undertaking without effect
Gal  Because if the heritage is by the law it is no longer dependent on the word of God but God gave it to Abraham by his word
Gal  What then is the law It was an addition made because of sin till the coming of the seed to whom the undertaking had been given and it was ordered through angels by the hand of a gobetween
Gal  Now a gobetween is not a gobetween of one but God is one
Gal  Is the law then against the words of God in no way because if there had been a law which was able to give life truly righteousness would have been by the law
Gal  However the holy Writings have put all things under sin so that that for which God gave the undertaking based on faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who have such faith
Gal  But before faith came we were kept in prison under the law waiting for the revelation of the faith which was to come
Gal  So the law has been a servant to take us to Christ so that we might have righteousness by faith
Gal  But now that faith is come we are no longer under a servant
Gal  Because you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus
Gal  For all those of you who were given baptism into Christ did put on Christ
Gal  There is no Jew or Greek servant or free male or female because you are all one in Jesus Christ
Gal  And if you are Christs then you are Abrahams seed and yours is the heritage by the right of Gods undertaking given to Abraham
Gal  But I say that as long as the son is a child he is in no way different from a servant though he is lord of all
Gal  But is under keepers and managers till the time fixed by the father
Gal  So we when we were young were kept under the first rules of the world
Gal  But when the time had come God sent out his Son made of a woman made under the law
Gal  That he might make them free who were under the law and that we might be given the place of sons
Gal  And because you are sons God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts saying Abba Father
Gal  So that you are no longer a servant but a son and if a son then the heritage of God is yours
Gal  But at that time having no knowledge of God you were servants to those who by right are no gods
Gal  But now that you have come to have knowledge of God or more truly God has knowledge of you how is it that you go back again to the poor and feeble first things desiring to be servants to them again
Gal  You keep days and months and fixed times and years
Gal  I am in fear of you that I may have been working for you to no purpose
Gal  My desire for you brothers is that you may be as I am because I am as you are You have done me no wrong
Gal  But you have knowledge that with a feeble body I was preaching the good news to you the first time
Gal  And you did not have a poor opinion of me because of the trouble in my flesh or put shame on it but you took me to your hearts as an angel of God even as Christ Jesus
Gal  Where then is that happy condition of yours because I give you witness that if possible you would have taken out your eyes and given them to me
Gal  So then am I no longer your friend because I give you true words
Gal  Their interest in you is not good but their desire is that you may be shut out so that you may go after them
Gal  But it is good to have an interest in a good cause at all times and not only when I am present with you
Gal  My children of whom I am again in birthpains till Christ is formed in you
Gal  Truly my desire is to be present with you now using a changed voice for I am troubled about you
Gal  Say you whose desire it is to be under the law do you not give ear to the law
Gal  Because it is in the Writings that Abraham had two sons one by the servantwoman and one by the free woman
Gal  Now the son by the servantwoman has his birth after the flesh but the son by the free woman has his birth through the undertaking of God
Gal  Which things have a secret sense because these women are the two agreements one from the mountain of Sinai giving birth to servants which is Hagar
Gal  Now this Hagar is the mountain Sinai in Arabia and is the image of the Jerusalem which now is which is a servant with her children
Gal  But the Jerusalem on high is free which is our mother
Gal  For it is in the Writings You who have never given birth be glad give cries of joy you who have had no birthpains for the children of her who has been given up by her husband are more than those of the woman who has a husband
Gal  Now we brothers as Isaac was are the children of the undertaking of God
Gal  But as in those days he who had birth after the flesh was cruel to him who had birth after the Spirit even so it is now
Gal  What then do the Writings say Send away the servantwoman and her son for the son of the servantwoman will not have a part in the heritage with the son of the free woman
Gal  So brothers we are not children of the servantwoman but of the free woman
Gal  Christ has truly made us free then keep your free condition and let no man put a yoke on you again
Gal  See I Paul say to you that if you undergo circumcision Christ will be of no use to you
Gal  Yes I give witness again to every man who undergoes circumcision that he will have to keep all the law
Gal  You are cut off from Christ you who would have righteousness by the law you are turned away from grace
Gal  For we through the Spirit by faith are waiting for the hope of righteousness
Gal  Because in Christ Jesus having circumcision or not having circumcision are equally of no profit but only faith working through love
Gal  You were going on well who was the cause of your not giving ear to what is true
Gal  This ready belief did not come from him who had made you his
Gal  A little leaven makes a change in all the mass
Gal  I am certain about you in the Lord that you will be of no other mind but he who is troubling you will have his punishment whoever he is
Gal  But I brothers if I am still preaching circumcision why am I still attacked then has the shame of the cross been taken away
Gal  My desire is that they who give you trouble might even be cut off themselves
Gal  Because you brothers were marked out to be free only do not make use of your free condition to give the flesh its chance but through love be servants one to another
Gal  For all the law is made complete in one word even in this Have love for your neighbour as for yourself
Gal  But if you are given to fighting with one another take care that you are not the cause of destruction one to another
Gal  But I say Go on in the Spirit and you will not come under the rule of the evil desires of the flesh
Gal  For the flesh has desires against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh because these are opposite the one to the other so that you may not do the things which you have a mind to do
Gal  But if you are guided by the Spirit you are not under the law
Gal  Now the works of the flesh are clear which are these evil desire unclean things wrong use of the senses
Gal  Worship of images use of strange powers hates fighting desire for what another has angry feelings attempts to get the better of others divisions false teachings
Gal  Envy uncontrolled drinking and feasting and such things of which I give you word clearly even as I did in the past that they who do such things will have no part in the kingdom of God
Gal  But the fruit of the Spirit is love joy peace a quiet mind kind acts welldoing faith
Gal  Gentle behaviour control over desires against such there is no law
Gal  And those who are Christs have put to death on the cross the flesh with its passions and its evil desires
Gal  If we are living by the Spirit by the Spirit let us be guided
Gal  Let us not be full of selfglory making one another angry having envy of one another
Gal  Brothers if a man is taken in any wrongdoing you who are of the Spirit will put such a one right in a spirit of love keeping watch on yourself for fear that you yourself may be tested
Gal  Take on yourselves one anothers troubles and so keep the law of Christ
Gal  For if a man has an idea that he is something when he is nothing he is tricked by himself
Gal  But let every man make test of his work and then will his cause for glory be in himself only and not in his neighbour
Gal  Because every man is responsible for his part of the work
Gal  But let him who gets teaching in the word give a part in all good things to his teacher
Gal  Be not tricked God is not made sport of for whatever seed a man puts in that will he get back as grain
Gal  Because he who puts in the seed of the flesh will of the flesh get the reward of death but he who puts in the seed of the Spirit will of the Spirit get the reward of eternal life
Gal  And let us not get tired of welldoing for at the right time we will get in the grain if we do not give way to weariness
Gal  So then as we have the chance let us do good to all men and specially to those who are of the family of the faith
Gal  See the size of the handwriting which I myself have made use of in writing to you
Gal  Those who have the desire to seem important in the flesh put force on you to undergo circumcision only that they may not be attacked because of the cross of Christ
Gal  Because even those who undergo circumcision do not themselves keep the law but they would have you undergo circumcision so that they may have glory in your flesh
Gal  But far be it from me to have glory in anything but only in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ through which this world has come to an end on the cross for me and I for it
Gal  For having circumcision is nothing and not having circumcision is nothing but only a new order of existence
Gal  And on all who are guided by this rule be peace and mercy and on the Israel of God
Gal  From this time on let no man be a trouble to me because my body is marked with the marks of Jesus
Gal  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit brothers So be it
Eph  Paul an Apostle of Christ Jesus by the purpose of God to the saints who are at Ephesus and those who have faith in Christ Jesus
Eph  Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
Eph  Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has given us every blessing of the Spirit in the heavens in Christ
Eph  Even as he made selection of us in him from the first so that we might be holy and free from all evil before him in love
Eph  As we were designed before by him for the position of sons to himself through Jesus Christ in the good pleasure of his purpose
Eph  To the praise of the glory of his grace which he freely gave to us in the Loved One
Eph  In whom we have salvation through his blood the forgiveness of our sins through the wealth of his grace
Eph  Which he gave us in full measure in all wisdom and care
Eph  Having made clear to us the secret of his purpose in agreement with the design which he had in mind to put into his hands
Eph  The ordering of the times when they are complete so that all things might come to a head in Christ the things in heaven and the things on the earth in him I say
Eph  In whom we have a heritage being marked out from the first in his purpose who does all things in agreement with his designs
Eph  So that his glory might have praise through us who first had hope in Christ
Eph  In whom you having been given the true word the good news of your salvation and through your faith in him were given the sign of the Holy Spirit of hope
Eph  Which is the firstfruit of our heritage till God gets back that which is his to the praise of his glory
Eph  For this cause I having had news of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you and which you make clear to all the saints
Eph  Give praise without end for you keeping you in mind in my prayers
Eph  That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ the Father of glory may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him
Eph  And that having the eyes of your heart full of light you may have knowledge of what is the hope of his purpose what is the wealth of the glory of his heritage in the saints
Eph  And how unlimited is his power to us who have faith as is seen in the working of the strength of his power
Eph  By which he made Christ come back from the dead and gave him a place at his right hand in heaven
Eph  Far over all rule and authority and power and every name which is named not only in the present order but in that which is to come
Eph  And he has put all things under his feet and has made him to be head over all things to the church
Eph  Which is his body the full measure of him in whom all things are made complete
Eph  And to you did he give life when you were dead through your wrongdoing and sins
Eph  In which you were living in the past after the ways of this present world doing the pleasure of the lord of the power of the air the spirit who is now working in those who go against the purpose of God
Eph  Among whom we all at one time were living in the pleasures of our flesh giving way to the desires of the flesh and of the mind and the punishment of God was waiting for us even as for the rest
Eph  But God being full of mercy through the great love which he had for us
Eph  Even when we were dead through our sins gave us life together with Christ by grace you have salvation
Eph  So that we came back from death with him and are seated with him in the heavens in Christ Jesus
Eph  That in the time to come he might make clear the full wealth of his grace in his mercy to us in Christ Jesus
Eph  Because by grace you have salvation through faith and that not of yourselves it is given by God
Eph  Not by works so that no man may take glory to himself
Eph  For by his act we were given existence in Christ Jesus to do those good works which God before made ready for us so that we might do them
Eph  For this reason keep it in mind that in the past you the Gentiles in the flesh who are looked on as being outside the circumcision by those who have circumcision in the flesh made by hands
Eph  That you were at that time without Christ being cut off from any part in Israels rights as a nation having no part in Gods agreement having no hope and without God in the world
Eph  But now in Christ Jesus you who at one time were far off are made near in the blood of Christ
Eph  For he is our peace who has made the two into one and by whom the middle wall of division has been broken down
Eph  Having in his flesh put an end to that which made the division between us even the law with its rules and orders so that he might make in himself of the two one new man so making peace
Eph  And that the two might come into agreement with God in one body through the cross so putting an end to that division
Eph  And he came preaching peace to you who were far off and to those who were near
Eph  Because through him the two of us are able to come near in one Spirit to the Father
Eph  So then you are no longer as those who have no part or place in the kingdom of God but you are numbered among the saints and of the family of God
Eph  Resting on the base of the Apostles and prophets Christ Jesus himself being the chief keystone
Eph  In whom all the building rightly joined together comes to be a holy house of God in the Lord
Eph  In whom you with the rest are united together as a livingplace of God in the Spirit
Eph  For this cause I Paul the prisoner of Christ Jesus for you Gentiles
Eph  If that ordering of the grace of God has come to your knowledge which was given to me for you
Eph  How by revelation the secret was made clear to me as I said before in a short letter
Eph  By the reading of which you will be clear about my knowledge of the secret of Christ
Eph  Which in other generations was not given to the sons of men but the revelation of it has now been made to his holy Apostles and prophets in the Spirit
Eph  Which is that the Gentiles have a part in the heritage and in the same body and in the same hope in Christ through the good news
Eph  Of which I was made a preacher through that grace of God which was given to me in the measure of the working of his power
Eph  To me who am less than the least of all the saints was this grace given so that I might make clear to the Gentiles the good news of the unending wealth of Christ
Eph  And make all men see what is the ordering of the secret which from the first has been kept in God who made all things
Eph  So that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavens might be made clear through the church the wideshining wisdom of God
Eph  Which is seen in his eternal purpose in Christ Jesus our Lord
Eph  By whom we come near to God without fear through faith in him
Eph  For this reason it is my prayer that you may not become feeble because of my troubles for you which are your glory
Eph  For this cause I go down on my knees before the Father
Eph  From whom every family in heaven and on earth is named
Eph  That in the wealth of his glory he would make you strong with power through his Spirit in your hearts
Eph  So that Christ may have his place in your hearts through faith and that you being rooted and based in love
Eph  May have strength to see with all the saints how wide and long and high and deep it is
Eph  And to have knowledge of the love of Christ which is outside all knowledge so that you may be made complete as God himself is complete
Eph  Now to him who is able to do in full measure more than all our desires or thoughts through the power which is working in us
Eph  To him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations for ever and ever So be it
Eph  I then the prisoner in the Lord make this request from my heart that you will see that your behaviour is a credit to the position which Gods purpose has given you
Eph  With all gentle and quiet behaviour taking whatever comes putting up with one another in love
Eph  Taking care to keep the harmony of the Spirit in the yoke of peace
Eph  There is one body and one Spirit even as you have been marked out by God in the one hope of his purpose for you
Eph  One Lord one faith one baptism
Eph  One God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all
Eph  But to every one of us has grace been given in the measure of the giving of Christ
Eph  For this reason he says He went up on high taking his prisoners with him and gave freely to men
Eph  Now this He went up what is it but that he first went down into the lower parts of the earth
Eph  He who went down is the same who went up far over all the heavens so that he might make all things complete
Eph  And he gave some as Apostles and some prophets and some preachers of the good news and some to give care and teaching
Eph  For the training of the saints as servants in the church for the building up of the body of Christ
Eph  Till we all come to the harmony of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God to full growth to the full measure of Christ
Eph  So that we may be no longer children sent this way and that turned about by every wind of teaching by the twisting and tricks of men by the deceits of error
Eph  But saying true words in love may come to full growth in him who is the head even Christ
Eph  Through whom all the body being rightly formed and united together by the full working of every part is increased to the building up of itself in love
Eph  This I say then and give witness in the Lord that you are to go no longer in the way of the Gentiles whose minds are turned to that which has no profit
Eph  Whose thoughts are dark to whom the life of God is strange because they are without knowledge and their hearts have been made hard
Eph  Who having no more power of feeling have given themselves up to evil passions to do all unclean things with overmuch desire
Eph  For this was not the teaching of Christ which was given to you
Eph  If in fact you gave ear to him and were given teaching in him even as what is true is made clear in Jesus
Eph  That you are to put away in relation to your earlier way of life the old man which has become evil by love of deceit
Eph  And be made new in the spirit of your mind
Eph  And put on the new man to which God has given life in righteousness and a true and holy way of living
Eph  And so putting away false words let everyone say what is true to his neighbour for we are parts one of another
Eph  Be angry without doing wrong let not the sun go down on your wrath
Eph  And do not give way to the Evil One
Eph  Let him who was a thief be so no longer but let him do good work with his hands so that he may have something to give to him who is in need
Eph  Let no evil talk come out of your mouth but only what is good for giving necessary teaching and for grace to those who give ear
Eph  And do not give grief to the Holy Spirit of God by whom you were marked for the day of salvation
Eph  Let all bitter sharp and angry feeling and noise and evil words be put away from you with all unkind acts
Eph  And be kind to one another full of pity having forgiveness for one another even as God in Christ had forgiveness for you
Eph  Let it then be your desire to be like God as wellloved children
Eph  And be living in love even as Christ had love for you and gave himself up for us an offering to God for a perfume of a sweet smell
Eph  But evil acts of the flesh and all unclean things or desire for others property let it not even be named among you as is right for saints
Eph  And let there be no low behaviour or foolish talk or words said in sport which are not right but in place of them the giving of praise
Eph  Being certain of this that no man who gives way to the passions of the flesh no unclean person or one who has desire for the property of others or who gives worship to images has any heritage in the kingdom of Christ and God
Eph  Do not be turned from the right way by foolish words for because of these things the punishment of God comes on those who do not put themselves under him
Eph  Have no part with such men
Eph  For you at one time were dark but now are light in the Lord let your behaviour be that of children of light
Eph  Because the fruit of the light is in all righteousness and in everything which is good and true
Eph  Testing by experience what is wellpleasing to the Lord
Eph  And have no company with the works of the dark which give no fruit but make their true quality clear
Eph  For the things which are done by them in secret it is shame even to put into words
Eph  But all things when their true quality is seen are made clear by the light because everything which is made clear is light
Eph  For this reason he says Be awake you who are sleeping and come up from among the dead and Christ will be your light
Eph  Take care then how you are living not as unwise but as wise
Eph  Making good use of the time because the days are evil
Eph  For this reason then do not be foolish but be conscious of the Lords pleasure
Eph  And do not take overmuch wine by which one may be overcome but be full of the Spirit
Eph  Joining with one another in holy songs of praise and of the Spirit using your voice in songs and making melody in your heart to the Lord
Eph  Giving praise at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God even the Father
Eph  Letting yourselves be ruled by one another in the fear of Christ
Eph  Wives be under the authority of your husbands as of the Lord
Eph  For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church being himself the saviour of the body
Eph  And as the church is under Christs authority so let wives be under the rule of their husbands in all things
Eph  Husbands have love for your wives even as Christ had love for the church and gave himself for it
Eph  So that he might make it holy having made it clean with the washing of water by the word
Eph  And might take it for himself a church full of glory not having one mark or fold or any such thing but that it might be holy and complete
Eph  Even so it is right for husbands to have love for their wives as for their bodies He who has love for his wife has love for himself
Eph  For no man ever had hate for his flesh but he gives it food and takes care of it even as Christ does for the church
Eph  Because we are parts of his body
Eph  For this cause will a man go away from his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two will become one flesh
Eph  This is a great secret but my words are about Christ and the church
Eph  But do you everyone have love for his wife even as for himself and let the wife see that she has respect for her husband
Eph  Children do what is ordered by your fathers and mothers in the Lord for this is right
Eph  Give honour to your father and mother which is the first rule having a reward
Eph  So that all may be well for you and your life may be long on the earth
Eph  And you fathers do not make your children angry but give them training in the teaching and fear of the Lord
Eph  Servants do what is ordered by those who are your natural masters having respect and fear for them with all your heart as to Christ
Eph  Not only under your masters eye as pleasers of men but as servants of Christ doing the pleasure of God from the heart
Eph  Doing your work readily as to the Lord and not to men
Eph  In the knowledge that for every good thing anyone does he will have his reward from the Lord If he is a servant or if he is free
Eph  And you masters do the same things to them not making use of violent words in the knowledge that their Master and yours is in heaven and he has no respect for a mans position
Eph  Lastly be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his power
Eph  Take up Gods instruments of war so that you may be able to keep your position against all the deceits of the Evil One
Eph  For our fight is not against flesh and blood but against authorities and powers against the worldrulers of this dark night against the spirits of evil in the heavens
Eph  For this reason take up all the arms of God so that you may be able to be strong in the evil day and having done all to keep your place
Eph  Take your place then having your body clothed with the true word and having put on the breastplate of righteousness
Eph  Be ready with the good news of peace as shoes on your feet
Eph  And most of all using faith as a cover to keep off all the flaming arrows of the Evil One
Eph  And take salvation for your headdress and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God
Eph  With prayers and deep desires making requests at all times in the Spirit and keeping watch with strong purpose in prayer for all the saints
Eph  And for me that words may be given to me in the opening of my mouth to make clear without fear the secret of the good news
Eph  For which I am a representative in chains and that I may say without fear the things which it is right for me to say
Eph  But so that you may have knowledge of my business and how I am Tychicus the wellloved brother and tested servant in the Lord will give you news of all things
Eph  Whom I have sent to you for this very purpose so that you may have knowledge of our position and that he may give comfort to your hearts
Eph  Peace be to the brothers and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
Eph  Grace be with all those who have true love for our Lord Jesus Christ
Phl  Paul and Timothy servants of Jesus Christ to all the saints in Christ Jesus at Philippi with the Bishops and Deacons of the church
Phl  Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
Phl  I give praise to my God at every memory of you
Phl  And in all my prayers for you all making my request with joy
Phl  Because of your help in giving the good news from the first day till now
Phl  For I am certain of this very thing that he by whom the good work was started in you will make it complete till the day of Jesus Christ
Phl  So it is right for me to take thought for you all in this way because I have you in my heart for in my chains and in my arguments before the judges in support of the good news making clear that it is true you all have your part with me in grace
Phl  For God is my witness how my love goes out to you all in the loving mercies of Christ Jesus
Phl  And my prayer is that you may be increased more and more in knowledge and experience
Phl  So that you may give your approval to the best things that you may be true and without wrongdoing till the day of Christ
Phl  Being full of the fruits of righteousness which are through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God
Phl  Now it is my purpose to make clear to you brothers that the cause of the good news has been helped by my experiences
Phl  So that it became clear through all the Praetorium and to all the rest that I was a prisoner on account of Christ
Phl  And most of the brothers in the Lord taking heart because of my chains are all the stronger to give the word of God without fear
Phl  Though some are preaching Christ out of envy and competition others do it out of a good heart
Phl  These do it from love conscious that I am responsible for the cause of the good news
Phl  But those are preaching Christ in a spirit of competition not from their hearts but with the purpose of giving me pain in my prison
Phl  What then only that in every way falsely or truly the preaching of Christ goes on and in this I am glad and will be glad
Phl  For I am conscious that this will be for my salvation through your prayer and the giving out of the stored wealth of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
Phl  In the measure of my strong hope and belief that in nothing will I be put to shame but that without fear as at all times so now will Christ have glory in my body by life or by death
Phl  For to me life is Christ and death is profit
Phl  But if I go on living in the fleshif this is the fruit of my workthen I do not see what decision to make
Phl  I am in a hard position between the two having a desire to go away and be with Christ which is very much better
Phl  Still to go on in the flesh is more necessary because of you
Phl  And being certain of this I am conscious that I will go on yes and go on with you all for your growth and joy in the faith
Phl  So that your pride in me may be increased in Christ Jesus through my being present with you again
Phl  Only let your behaviour do credit to the good news of Christ so that if I come and see you or if I am away from you I may have news of you that you are strong in one spirit working together with one soul for the faith of the good news
Phl  Having no fear of those who are against you which is a clear sign of their destruction but of your salvation and that from God
Phl  Because to you it has been given in the cause of Christ not only to have faith in him but to undergo pain on his account
Phl  Fighting the same fight which you saw in me and now have word of in me
Phl  If then there is any comfort in Christ any help given by love any uniting of hearts in the Spirit any loving mercies and pity
Phl  Make my joy complete by being of the same mind having the same love being in harmony and of one mind
Phl  Doing nothing through envy or through pride but with low thoughts of self let everyone take others to be better than himself
Phl  Not looking everyone to his private good but keeping in mind the things of others
Phl  Let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus
Phl  To whom though himself in the form of God it did not seem that to take for oneself was to be like God
Phl  But he made himself as nothing taking the form of a servant being made like men
Phl  And being seen in form as a man he took the lowest place and let himself be put to death even the death of the cross
Phl  For this reason God has put him in the highest place and has given to him the name which is greater than every name
Phl  So that at the name of Jesus every knee may be bent of those in heaven and those on earth and those in the underworld
Phl  And that every tongue may give witness that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father
Phl  So then my loved ones as you have at all times done what I say not only when I am present but now much more when I am not with you give yourselves to working out your salvation with fear in your hearts
Phl  For it is God who is the cause of your desires and of your acts for his good pleasure
Phl  Do all things without protests and arguments
Phl  So that you may be holy and gentle children of God without sin in a twisted and foolish generation among whom you are seen as lights in the world
Phl  Offering the word of life so that I may have glory in you in the day of Christ because my running was not for nothing and my work was not without effect
Phl  And even if I am offered like a drink offering giving myself for the cause and work of your faith I am glad and have joy with you all
Phl  And in the same way do you be glad and have a part in my joy
Phl  But I am hoping in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you before long so that I may be comforted when I have news of you
Phl  For I have no man of like mind who will truly have care for you
Phl  For they all go after what is theirs not after the things of Christ
Phl  But his quality is clear to you how as a child is to its father so he was a help to me in the work of the good news
Phl  Him then I am hoping to send as quickly as possible when I am able to see how things will go for me
Phl  But I have faith in the Lord that I myself will come before long
Phl  But it seemed to me necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my brother who has taken part with me in the work and in the fight and your servant sent by you for help in my need
Phl  Because his heart was with you all and he was greatly troubled because you had news that he was ill
Phl  For in fact he was ill almost to death but God had mercy on him and not only on him but on me so that I might not have grief on grief
Phl  I have sent him then the more gladly so that when you see him again you may be happy and I may have the less sorrow
Phl  So take him to your hearts in the Lord with all joy and give honour to such as he is
Phl  Because for the work of Christ he was near to death putting his life in danger to make your care for me complete
Phl  For the rest my brothers be glad in the Lord Writing the same things to you is no trouble to me and for you it is safe
Phl  Be on the watch against dogs against the workers of evil against those of the circumcision
Phl  For we are the circumcision who give worship to God and have glory in Jesus Christ and have no faith in the flesh
Phl  Even though I myself might have faith in the flesh if any other man has reason to have faith in the flesh I have more
Phl  Being given circumcision on the eighth day of the nation of Israel of the tribe of Benjamin a Hebrew of Hebrews in relation to the law a Pharisee
Phl  In bitter hate I was cruel to the church I kept all the righteousness of the law to the last detail
Phl  But those things which were profit to me I gave up for Christ
Phl  Yes truly and I am ready to give up all things for the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord which is more than all for whom I have undergone the loss of all things and to me they are less than nothing so that I may have Christ as my reward
Phl  And be seen in him not having my righteousness which is of the law but that which is through faith in Christ the righteousness which is of God by faith
Phl  That I may have knowledge of him and of the power of his coming back from the dead and a part with him in his pains becoming like him in his death
Phl  If in any way I may have the reward of life from the dead
Phl  Not as if I had even now got the reward or been made complete but I go on in the hope that I may come to the knowledge of that for which I was made the servant of Christ Jesus
Phl  Brothers it is clear to me that I have not come to that knowledge but one thing I do letting go those things which are past and stretching out to the things which are before
Phl  I go forward to the mark even the reward of the high purpose of God in Christ Jesus
Phl  Then let us all who have come to full growth be of this mind and if in anything you are of a different mind even this will God make clear to you
Phl  Only as far as we have got let us be guided by the same rule
Phl  Brothers take me as your example and take note of those who are walking after the example we have given
Phl  For there are those of whom I have given you word before and do so now with sorrow who are haters of the cross of Christ
Phl  Whose end is destruction whose god is the stomach and whose glory is in their shame whose minds are fixed on the things of the earth
Phl  For our country is in heaven from where the Saviour for whom we are waiting will come even the Lord Jesus Christ
Phl  By whom this poor body of ours will be changed into the image of the body of his glory in the measure of the working by which he is able to put all things under himself
Phl  So my brothers well loved and very dear to me my joy and crown be strong in the Lord my loved ones
Phl  I make request to Euodias and Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord
Phl  And I make request to you true helper in my work to see to the needs of those women who took part with me in the good news with Clement and the rest of my brotherworkers whose names are in the book of life
Phl  Be glad in the Lord at all times again I say Be glad
Phl  Let your gentle behaviour be clear to all men The Lord is near
Phl  Have no cares but in everything with prayer and praise put your requests before God
Phl  And the peace of God which is deeper than all knowledge will keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus
Phl  For the rest my brothers whatever things are true whatever things have honour whatever things are upright whatever things are holy whatever things are beautiful whatever things are of value if there is any virtue and if there is any praise give thought to these things
Phl  The things which came to you by my teaching and preaching and which you saw in me these things do and the God of peace will be with you
Phl  But I am very glad in the Lord that your care for me has come to life again though you did in fact take thought for me but you were not able to give effect to it
Phl  But I will not say anything about my needs for I am able wherever I am to be dependent on myself
Phl  It is the same to me if I am looked down on or honoured everywhere and in all things I have the secret of how to be full and how to go without food how to have wealth and how to be in need
Phl  I am able to do all things through him who gives me strength
Phl  But you did well to have care for me in my need
Phl  And you have knowledge Philippians that when the good news first came to you when I went away from Macedonia no church took part with me in the business of giving to the saints but you only
Phl  Because even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to me in my need
Phl  Not that I am looking for an offering but for fruit which may be put to your credit
Phl  I have all things and more than enough I am made full having had from Epaphroditus the things which came from you a perfume of a sweet smell an offering well pleasing to God
Phl  And my God will give you all you have need of from the wealth of his glory in Christ Jesus
Phl  Now to God our Father be glory for ever and ever So be it
Phl  Give words of love to every saint in Christ Jesus The brothers who are with me send you their love
Phl  All the saints send their love to you specially those who are of Caesars house
Phl  The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit
Col  Paul an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the purpose of God and Timothy our brother
Col  To the saints and true brothers in Christ at Colossae Grace to you and peace from God our Father
Col  We give praise to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ making prayer for you at all times
Col  After hearing of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love which you have for all the saints
Col  Through the hope which is in store for you in heaven knowledge of which was given to you before in the true word of the good news
Col  Which has come to you and which in all the world is giving fruit and increase as it has done in you from the day when it came to your ears and you had true knowledge of the grace of God
Col  As it was given to you by Epaphras our wellloved helper who is a true servant of Christ for us
Col  And who himself made clear to us your love in the Spirit
Col  For this reason we from the day when we had word of it keep on in prayer for you that you may be full of the knowledge of his purpose with all wisdom and experience of the Spirit
Col  Living uprightly in the approval of the Lord giving fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God
Col  Full of strength in the measure of the great power of his glory so that you may undergo all troubles with joy
Col  Giving praise to the Father who has given us a part in the heritage of the saints in light
Col  Who has made us free from the power of evil and given us a place in the kingdom of the Son of his love
Col  In whom we have our salvation the forgiveness of sins
Col  Who is the image of the unseen God coming into existence before all living things
Col  For by him all things were made in heaven and on earth things seen and things unseen authorities lords rulers and powers all things were made by him and for him
Col  He is before all things and in him all things have being
Col  And he is the head of the body the church the starting point of all things the first to come again from the dead so that in all things he might have the chief place
Col  For God in full measure was pleased to be in him
Col  Through him uniting all things with himself having made peace through the blood of his cross through him I say uniting all things which are on earth or in heaven
Col  And you who in the past were cut off and at war with God in your minds through evil works he has now made one
Col  In the body of his flesh through death so that you might be holy and without sin and free from all evil before him
Col  If you keep yourselves safely based in the faith not moved from the hope of the good news which came to you and which was given to every living being under heaven of which I Paul was made a servant
Col  Now I have joy in my pain because of you and in my flesh I undergo whatever is still needed to make the sorrows of Christ complete for the salvation of his body the church
Col  Of which I became a servant by the purpose of God which was given to me for you to give effect to the word of God
Col  The secret which has been kept from all times and generations but has now been made clear to his saints
Col  To whom God was pleased to give knowledge of the wealth of the glory of this secret among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory
Col  Whom we are preaching guiding and teaching every man in all wisdom so that every man may be complete in Christ
Col  And for this purpose I am working using all my strength by the help of his power which is working in me strongly
Col  For it is my desire to give you news of the great fight I am making for you and for those at Laodicea and for all who have not seen my face in the flesh
Col  So that their hearts may be comforted and that being joined together in love they may come to the full wealth of the certain knowledge of the secret of God even Christ
Col  In whom are all the secret stores of wisdom and knowledge
Col  I say this so that you may not be turned away by any deceit of words
Col  For though I am not present in the flesh still I am with you in the spirit seeing with joy your order and your unchanging faith in Christ
Col  As then you took Christ Jesus the Lord so go on in him
Col  Rooted and based together in him strong in the faith which the teaching gave you giving praise to God at all times
Col  Take care that no one takes you away by force through mans wisdom and deceit going after the beliefs of men and the theories of the world and not after Christ
Col  For in him all the wealth of Gods being has a living form
Col  And you are complete in him who is the head of all rule and authority
Col  In whom you had a circumcision not made with hands in the putting off of the body of the flesh in the circumcision of Christ
Col  Having been put to death with him in baptism by which you came to life again with him through faith in the working of God who made him come back from the dead
Col  And you being dead through your sins and the evil condition of your flesh to you I say he gave life together with him and forgiveness of all our sins
Col  Having put an end to the handwriting of the law which was against us taking it out of the way by nailing it to his cross
Col  Having made himself free from the rule of authorities and powers he put them openly to shame glorying over them in it
Col  For this reason let no man be your judge in any question of food or drink or feast days or new moons or Sabbaths
Col  For these are an image of the things which are to come but the body is Christs
Col  Let no man take your reward from you by consciously making little of himself and giving worship to angels having his thoughts fixed on the things which he has seen being foolishly lifted up in his natural mind
Col  And not joined to the Head from whom all the body being given strength and kept together through its joins and bands has its growth with the increase of God
Col  If you were made free by your death with Christ from the rules of the world why do you put yourselves under the authority of orders
Col  Which say there may be no touching tasting or taking in your hands
Col  Rules which are all to come to an end with their use after the orders and teaching of men
Col  These things seem to have a sort of wisdom in selfordered worship and making little of oneself and being cruel to the body not honouring it by giving it its natural use
Col  If then you have a new life with Christ give your attention to the things of heaven where Christ is seated at the right hand of God
Col  Keep your mind on the higher things not on the things of earth
Col  For your life on earth is done and you have a secret life with Christ in God
Col  At the coming of Christ who is our life you will be seen with him in glory
Col  Then put to death your bodies which are of the earth wrong use of the flesh unclean things passion evil desires and envy which is the worship of strange gods
Col  Because of which the wrath of God comes on those who go against his orders
Col  Among whom you were living in the past when you did such things
Col  But now it is right for you to put away all these things wrath passion bad feeling curses unclean talk
Col  Do not make false statements to one another because you have put away the old man with all his doings
Col  And have put on the new man which has become new in knowledge after the image of his maker
Col  Where there is no Greek or Jew no one with circumcision or without circumcision no division between nations no servant or free man but Christ is all and in all
Col  As saints of God then holy and dearly loved let your behaviour be marked by pity and mercy kind feeling a low opinion of yourselves gentle ways and a power of undergoing all things
Col  Being gentle to one another and having forgiveness for one another if anyone has done wrong to his brother even as the Lord had forgiveness for you
Col  And more than all have love the only way in which you may be completely joined together
Col  And let the peace of Christ be ruling in your hearts as it was the purpose of God for you to be one body and give praise to God at all times
Col  Let the word of Christ be in you in all wealth of wisdom teaching and helping one another with songs of praise and holy words making melody to God with grace in your hearts
Col  And whatever you do in word or in act do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving praise to God the Father through him
Col  Wives be under the authority of your husbands as is right in the Lord
Col  Husbands have love for your wives and be not bitter against them
Col  Children do the orders of your fathers and mothers in all things for this is pleasing to the Lord
Col  Fathers do not be hard on your children so that their spirit may not be broken
Col  Servants in all things do the orders of your natural masters not only when their eyes are on you as pleasers of men but with all your heart fearing the Lord
Col  Whatever you do do it readily as to the Lord and not to men
Col  Being certain that the Lord will give you the reward of the heritage for you are the servants of the Lord Christ
Col  For the wrongdoer will have punishment for the wrong he has done without respect for any mans position
Col  Masters give your servants what is right and equal conscious that you have a Master in heaven
Col  Give yourselves to prayer at all times keeping watch with praise
Col  And making prayer for us that God may give us an open door for the preaching of the word the secret of Christ for which I am now in chains
Col  So that I may make it clear as it is right for me to do
Col  Be wise in your behaviour to those who are outside making good use of the time
Col  Let your talk be with grace mixed with salt so that you may be able to give an answer to everyone
Col  Tychicus will give you news of all my business he is a dear brother and true servant and helper in the word
Col  And I have sent him to you for this very purpose so that you may have news of how we are and so that he may give your hearts comfort
Col  And with him I have sent Onesimus the true and wellloved brother who is one of you They will give you word of everything which is taking place here
Col  Aristarchus my brotherprisoner sends his love to you and Mark a relation of Barnabas about whom you have been given orders if he comes to you be kind to him
Col  And Jesus whose other name is Justus these are of the circumcision they are my only brotherworkers for the kingdom of God who have been a comfort to me
Col  Epaphras who is one of you a servant of Christ Jesus sends you his love ever taking thought for you in his prayers that you may be complete and fully certain of all the purpose of God
Col  For I give witness of him that he has undergone much trouble for you and for those in Laodicea and in Hierapolis
Col  Luke our wellloved medical friend and Demas send you their love
Col  Give my love to the brothers in Laodicea and to Nymphas and the church in their house
Col  And when this letter has been made public among you let the same be done in the church of Laodicea and see that you have the letter from Laodicea
Col  Say to Archippus See that you do the work which the Lord has given you to do
Col  I Paul give you this word of love in my handwriting Keep in memory that I am a prisoner Grace be with you
Ts  Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ Grace to you and peace
Ts  We give praise to God at all times for you keeping you in memory in our prayers
Ts  Having ever in mind your work of faith and acts of love and the strength of your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ before our God and Father
Ts  Being conscious my brothers dear to God that you have been marked out by Gods purpose
Ts  Because our good news came to you not in word only but in power and in the Holy Spirit so that you were completely certain of it even as you saw what our behaviour to you was like from our love to you
Ts  And you took us and the Lord as your example after the word had come to you in much trouble with joy in the Holy Spirit
Ts  So that you became an example to all those who have faith in Christ in Macedonia and Achaia
Ts  For not only was the word of the Lord sounding out from you in Macedonia and Achaia but in every place your faith in God is made clear so that we have no need to say anything
Ts  For they themselves give the news of how we came among you and how you were turned from images to God to the worship of a true and living God
Ts  Waiting for his Son from heaven who came back from the dead even Jesus our Saviour from the wrath to come
Ts  For you yourselves brothers are conscious that our coming among you was not without effect
Ts  But after we had first undergone much pain and been cruelly attacked as you saw at Philippi by the help of God we gave you the good news without fear though everything was against us
Ts  For our witness does not come from error or from an unclean heart or from deceit
Ts  But even as the good news was given to us by the approval of God so we give it out not as pleasing men but God by whom our hearts are tested
Ts  For it is common knowledge among you that we never made use of smoothsounding false words and God is witness that at no time were we secretly desiring profit for ourselves
Ts  Or looking for glory from men from you or from others when we might have made ourselves a care to you as Apostles of Christ
Ts  But we were gentle among you like a woman caring for her little ones
Ts  Even so being full of loving desire for you we took delight in giving you not only Gods good news but even our lives because you were dear to us
Ts  For you have the memory my brothers of our trouble and care how working night and day so that we might not be a trouble to any of you we gave you the good news of God
Ts  You are witnesses with God how holy and upright and free from all evil was our way of life among you who have faith
Ts  Even as you saw how like a father with his children we were teaching and comforting you all and giving witness
Ts  So that your lives might be pleasing to God who has given you a part in his kingdom and his glory
Ts  And for this cause we still give praise to God that when the word came to your ears through us you took it not as the word of man but as it truly is the word of God which has living power in you who have faith
Ts  For you my brothers took as your examples the churches of God which are in Judaea in Christ Jesus because you underwent the same things from your countrymen as they did from the Jews
Ts  Who put to death the Lord Jesus and the prophets violently driving us out who are unpleasing to God and against all men
Ts  Who to make the measure of their sins complete kept us from giving the word of salvation to the Gentiles but the wrath of God is about to come on them in the fullest degree
Ts  But we my brothers being away from you for a short time in body but not in heart had all the more desire to see your face
Ts  For which reason we made attempts to come to you even I Paul once and again but Satan kept us from coming
Ts  For what is our hope or joy or crown of glory Are not even you before our Lord Jesus at his coming
Ts  For you are our glory and our joy
Ts  At last our desire to have news of you was so strong that while we ourselves were waiting at Athens
Ts  We sent Timothy our brother and Gods servant in the good news of Christ to give you strength and comfort in your faith
Ts  So that no man might be moved by these troubles because you see that these things are part of Gods purpose for us
Ts  And when we were with you we said to you that trouble was before us and so it came about as you see
Ts  For this reason when I was no longer able to keep quiet I sent to get news of your faith fearing that you might be tested by the Evil One and that our work might come to nothing
Ts  But now that Timothy has come to us from you and has given us good news of your faith and love and that you have happy memories of us desiring greatly to see us even as we do to see you
Ts  For this cause brothers in all our trouble and grief we were comforted about you because of your faith
Ts  For it is life to us if you keep your faith in the Lord unchanged
Ts  For how great is the praise which we give to God for you and how great the joy with which we are glad because of you before our God
Ts  Night and day requesting God again and again that we may see your face and make your faith complete
Ts  Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus make a way for us to come to you
Ts  And the Lord give you increase of love in fullest measure to one another and to all men even as our love to you
Ts  So that your hearts may be strong and free from all sin before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints
Ts  And last of all the prayer which we make to you from our heart and in the name of the Lord Jesus is this that as we made clear to you what sort of behaviour is pleasing to God as in fact you are doing now so you will go on in these ways but more and more
Ts  Because you have in mind the orders we gave you through the Lord Jesus
Ts  For the purpose of God for you is this that you may be holy and may keep yourselves from the desires of the flesh
Ts  So that every one of you may keep his body holy and in honour
Ts  Not in the passion of evil desires like the Gentiles who have no knowledge of God
Ts  And that no man may make attempts to get the better of his brother in business for the Lord is the judge in all these things as we said to you before and gave witness
Ts  Because it is Gods purpose that our way of life may be not unclean but holy
Ts  Whoever then goes against this word goes against not man but God who gives his Holy Spirit to you
Ts  But about loving the brothers there is no need for me to say anything to you in this letter for you have the teaching of God that love for one another is right and necessary
Ts  And truly you are lovers of all the brothers in Macedonia but it is our desire that your love may be increased still more
Ts  And that you may take pride in being quiet and doing your business working with your hands as we gave you orders
Ts  That you may be respected by those who are outside and may have need of nothing
Ts  But it is our desire brothers that you may be certain about those who are sleeping so that you may have no need for sorrow as others have who are without hope
Ts  For if we have faith that Jesus underwent death and came back again even so those who are sleeping will come again with him by Gods power
Ts  For this we say to you by the word of the Lord that we who are still living at the coming of the Lord will not go before those who are sleeping
Ts  Because the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a word of authority with the voice of the chief angel with the sound of a horn and the dead in Christ will come to life first
Ts  Then we who are still living will be taken up together with them into the clouds to see the Lord in the air and so will we be for ever with the Lord
Ts  So then give comfort to one another with these words
Ts  But about the times and their order my brothers there is no need for me to say anything to you
Ts  For you yourselves have the knowledge that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night
Ts  When they say There is peace and no danger then sudden destruction will come on them as birthpains on a woman with child and they will not be able to get away from it
Ts  But you my brothers are not in the dark for that day to overtake you like a thief
Ts  For you are all sons of light and of the day we are not of the night or of the dark
Ts  So then let us not take our rest as the others do but let us be selfcontrolled and awake
Ts  For those who are sleeping do so in the night and those who are the worse for drink are so in the night
Ts  But let us who are of the day be serious putting on the breastplate of faith and love and on our heads the hope of salvation
Ts  For Gods purpose for us is not wrath but salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ
Ts  Who was put to death for us so that awake or sleeping we may have a part in his life
Ts  So then go on comforting and building up one another as you have been doing
Ts  But we make this request to you my brothers give attention to those who are working among you who are over you in the Lord to keep order among you
Ts  And have a high opinion of them in love because of their work Be at peace among yourselves
Ts  And our desire is that you will keep control over those whose lives are not well ordered giving comfort to the feeblehearted supporting those with little strength and putting up with much from all
Ts  Let no one give evil for evil but ever go after what is good for one another and for all
Ts  Have joy at all times
Ts  Keep on with your prayers
Ts  In everything give praise for this is the purpose of God in Christ Jesus for you
Ts  Do not put out the light of the Spirit
Ts  Do not make little of the words of the prophets
Ts  Let all things be tested keep to what is good
Ts  Keep from every form of evil
Ts  And may the God of peace himself make you holy in every way and may your spirit and soul and body be free from all sin at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
Ts  God by whom you have been marked out in his purpose is unchanging and will make it complete
Ts  Brothers keep us in mind in your prayers
Ts  Give all the brothers a holy kiss
Ts  I give orders in the name of the Lord that all the brothers are to be present at the reading of this letter
Ts  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you
Ts  Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
Ts  Grace to you and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
Ts  It is right for us to give praise to God at all times for you brothers because of the great increase of your faith and the wealth of your love for one another
Ts  So that we ourselves take pride in you in the churches of God for your untroubled mind and your faith in all the troubles and sorrows which you are going through
Ts  Which is a clear sign of the decision which God in his righteousness has made to give you a part in his kingdom for which you have undergone this pain
Ts  For it is an act of righteousness on Gods part to give trouble as their reward to those who are troubling you
Ts  And to you who are troubled rest with us when the Lord Jesus comes from heaven with the angels of his power in flames of fire
Ts  To give punishment to those who have no knowledge of God and to those who do not give ear to the good news of our Lord Jesus
Ts  Whose reward will be eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his strength
Ts  At his coming when he will have glory in his saints and will be a cause of wonder in all those who had faith because our witness among you had effect in that day
Ts  For this reason you are ever in our prayers that you may seem to our God such as may have a part in his purpose and that by his power he will make all his good purpose and the work of faith complete
Ts  So that glory may be given to the name of our Lord Jesus through you and you may have glory in him by the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ
Ts  Now as to the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and our meeting with him it is our desire my brothers
Ts  That you may not be moved in mind or troubled by a spirit or by a word or by a letter as from us with the suggestion that the day of the Lord is even now come
Ts  Give no belief to false words because there will first be a falling away from the faith and the revelation of the man of sin the son of destruction
Ts  Who puts himself against all authority lifting himself up over all which is named God or is given worship so that he takes his seat in the Temple of God putting himself forward as God
Ts  Have you no memory of what I said when I was with you giving you word of these things
Ts  And now it is clear to you what is keeping back his revelation till the time comes for him to be seen
Ts  For the secret of evil is even now at work but there is one who is keeping back the evil till he is taken out of the way
Ts  And then will come the revelation of that evil one whom the Lord Jesus will put to death with the breath of his mouth and give to destruction by the revelation of his coming
Ts  Even the one whose coming is marked by the working of Satan with all power and signs and false wonders
Ts  And with every deceit of wrongdoing among those whose fate is destruction because they were quite without that love of the true faith by which they might have salvation
Ts  And for this cause God will give them up to the power of deceit and they will put their faith in what is false
Ts  So that they all may be judged who had no faith in what is true but took pleasure in evil
Ts  But it is right for us to give praise to God at all times for you brothers loved by the Lord because it was the purpose of God from the first that you might have salvation being made holy by the Spirit and by faith in what is true
Ts  And in this purpose he gave you a part through the good news of which we were the preachers even that you might have part in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ
Ts  So then brothers be strong in purpose and keep the teaching which has been given to you by word or by letter from us
Ts  Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father who had love for us and has given us eternal comfort and good hope through grace
Ts  Give you comfort and strength in every good work and word
Ts  For the rest my brothers let there be prayer for us that the word of the Lord may go forward with increasing glory even as it does with you
Ts  And that we may be made free from foolish and evil men for not all have faith
Ts  But the Lord is true who will give you strength and keep you safe from evil
Ts  And we have faith in the Lord about you that you are doing and will do the things about which we give you orders
Ts  And may your hearts be guided by the Lord into the love of God and quiet waiting for Christ
Ts  Now we give you orders brothers in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to keep away from all those whose behaviour is not well ordered and in harmony with the teaching which they had from us
Ts  For you yourselves are used to taking us as your example because our life among you was ruled by order
Ts  And we did not take food from any man for nothing but were working hard night and day not to be a trouble to any of you
Ts  Not because we have not the right but to make ourselves an example to you so that you might do the same
Ts  For even when we were with you we gave you orders saying If any man does no work let him not have food
Ts  For it has come to our ears that there are some among you whose behaviour is uncontrolled who do no work at all but are overinterested in the business of others
Ts  Now to such we give orders and make request in the Lord Jesus that working quietly they get their living
Ts  And you my brothers do not get tired of welldoing
Ts  And if any man does not give attention to what we have said in this letter take note of that man and keep away from him so that he may be shamed
Ts  Have no feeling of hate for him but take him in hand seriously as a brother
Ts  Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way May the Lord be with you all
Ts  These words of love to you at the end are in my writing Pauls writing and this is the mark of every letter from me
Ts  May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all
Ti  Paul an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the order of God our Saviour and Christ Jesus our hope
Ti  To Timothy my true child in the faith Grace mercy peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord
Ti  It was my desire when I went on into Macedonia that you might make a stop at Ephesus to give orders to certain men not to put forward a different teaching
Ti  Or to give attention to stories and long lists of generations from which come questionings and doubts in place of Gods ordered way of life which is in faith
Ti  But the effect of the order is love coming from a clean heart and a knowledge of what is right and true faith
Ti  From which some have been turned away giving themselves to foolish talking
Ti  Desiring to be teachers of the law though they have no knowledge of what they say or of the statements which they make so certainly
Ti  We are conscious that the law is good if a man makes a right use of it
Ti  With the knowledge that the law is made not for the upright man but for those who have no respect for law and order for evil men and sinners for the unholy and those who have no religion for those who put their fathers or mothers to death for takers of life
Ti  For those who go after loose women for those with unnatural desires for those who take men prisoners who make false statements and false oaths and those who do any other things against the right teaching
Ti  Which may be seen in the good news of the glory of the great God which was given into my care
Ti  I give praise to him who gave me power Christ Jesus our Lord because he took me to be true making me his servant
Ti  Though I had said violent words against God and done cruel acts causing great trouble but I was given mercy because I did it without knowledge not having faith
Ti  And the grace of our Lord was very great with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus
Ti  It is a true saying in which all may put their faith that Christ Jesus came into the world to give salvation to sinners of whom I am the chief
Ti  But for this reason I was given mercy so that in me the chief of sinners Jesus Christ might make clear all his mercy as an example to those who in the future would have faith in him to eternal life
Ti  Now to the King eternal everliving unseen the only God be honour and glory for ever and ever So be it
Ti  This order I give to you Timothy my son in harmony with the words of the prophets about you so that by them you may be strong fighting the good fight
Ti  Keeping faith and being conscious of welldoing for some by not doing these things have gone wrong in relation to the faith
Ti  Such are Hymenaeus and Alexander whom I have given up to Satan so that they may say no more evil words against God
Ti  My desire is first of all that you will make requests and prayers and give praise for all men
Ti  For kings and all those in authority so that we may have a calm and quiet life in all fear of God and serious behaviour
Ti  This is good and pleasing in the eyes of God our Saviour
Ti  Whose desire is that all men may have salvation and come to the knowledge of what is true
Ti  For there is one God and one peacemaker between God and men the man Christ Jesus
Ti  Who gave himself as an offering for all witness of which was to be given at the right time
Ti  And of this I became a preacher and an Apostle what I say is true not false and a teacher of the Gentiles in the true faith
Ti  It is my desire then that in every place men may give themselves to prayer lifting up holy hands without wrath or argument
Ti  And that women may be dressed in simple clothing with a quiet and serious air not with twisted hair and gold or jewels or robes of great price
Ti  But clothed with good works as is right for women who are living in the fear of God
Ti  Let a woman quietly take the place of a learner and be under authority
Ti  In my opinion it is right for a woman not to be a teacher or to have rule over a man but to be quiet
Ti  For Adam was first formed then Eve
Ti  And Adam was not taken by deceit but the woman being tricked became a wrongdoer
Ti  But if they go on in faith and love and holy selfcontrol she will be kept safe at the time of childbirth
Ti  This is a true saying A man desiring the position of a Bishop has a desire for a good work
Ti  The Bishop then is to be a man of good name the husband of one wife selfcontrolled seriousminded having respect for order opening his house freely to guests a ready teacher
Ti  Not quickly moved to wrath or blows but gentle no fighter no lover of money
Ti  Ruling his house well having his children under control with all serious behaviour
Ti  For if a man has not the art of ruling his house how will he take care of the church of God
Ti  Not one newly taken into the church for fear that through his high opinion of himself he may come into the same sin as the Evil One
Ti  And he is to have a good name among those outside the church so that nothing may be said against him and he may not be taken by the designs of the Evil One
Ti  Deacons in the same way are to be serious in their behaviour not false in word not given to taking much wine or greatly desiring the wealth of this world
Ti  Keeping the secret of the faith in a heart free from sin
Ti  And let these first be put to the test then let them become Deacons if there is nothing against them
Ti  Women are to be serious in behaviour saying no evil of others controlling themselves true in all things
Ti  Let Deacons be husbands of one wife ruling their children and their houses well
Ti  For those who have done good work as Deacons get for themselves a good position and become free from fear in the faith which is in Christ Jesus
Ti  I am writing these things to you though I am hoping to come to you before long
Ti  But if I am long in coming this will make clear to you what behaviour is right for men in the house of God which is the church of the living God the pillar and base of what is true
Ti  And without argument great is the secret of religion He who was seen in the flesh who was given Gods approval in the spirit was seen by the angels of whom the good news was given among the nations in whom the world had faith who was taken up in glory
Ti  But the Spirit says clearly that in later times some will be turned away from the faith giving their minds to spirits of deceit and the teachings of evil spirits
Ti  Through the false ways of men whose words are untrue whose hearts are burned as with a heated iron
Ti  Who keep men from being married and from taking food which God made to be taken with praise by those who have faith and true knowledge
Ti  Because everything which God has made is good and nothing is evil if it is taken with praise
Ti  For it is made holy by the word of God and by prayer
Ti  If you keep these things before the minds of the brothers you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus trained in the words of the faith and of the right teaching which has been your guide
Ti  But have nothing to do with unclean and foolish stories Give yourself training in religion
Ti  For the training of the body is of profit for a little but religion is of profit in every way giving hope for the life which now is and for that which is to come
Ti  This is a true saying in which all may put their faith
Ti  And this is the purpose of all our work and our fighting because our hope is in the living God who is the Saviour of all men and specially of those who have faith
Ti  Let these be your orders and your teaching
Ti  Let no one make little of you because you are young but be an example to the church in word in behaviour in love in faith in holy living
Ti  Till I come give attention to the reading of the holy Writings to comforting the saints and to teaching
Ti  Make use of that grace in you which was given to you by the word of the prophets when the rulers of the church put their hands on you
Ti  Have a care for these things give yourself to them with all your heart so that all may see how you go forward
Ti  Give attention to yourself and your teaching Go on in these things for in doing so you will get salvation for yourself and for those who give hearing to you
Ti  Do not say sharp words to one who has authority in the church but let your talk be as to a father and to the younger men as to brothers
Ti  To the older women as to mothers to the younger as to sisters with a clean heart
Ti  Give honour to widows who are truly widows
Ti  But if any widow has children or childrens children let these see that it is right to take care of their family and their fathers and mothers for this is pleasing in the eyes of God
Ti  Now she who is truly a widow and without family puts her hope in God giving herself to prayer day and night
Ti  But she who gives herself to pleasure is dead while she is living
Ti  Give orders to this effect so that no evil may be said of anyone
Ti  If anyone has no care for his family and those in his house he is false to the faith and is worse than one who has no faith
Ti  Let no woman be numbered among the widows who is under sixty years old and only if she has been the wife of one man
Ti  And if witness is given of her good works if she has had the care of children if she has been kind to travellers washing the feet of the saints helping those who are in trouble giving herself to good works
Ti  But to the younger widows say No for when their love is turned away from Christ they have a desire to be married
Ti  And they are judged because they have been false to their first faith
Ti  And they get into the way of doing no work going about from house to house and not only doing no work but talking foolishly being overinterested in the business of others saying things which they have no right to say
Ti  So it is my desire that the younger widows may be married and have children controlling their families and giving the Evil One no chance to say anything against them
Ti  For even now some are turned away to Satan
Ti  If any woman of the faith has relations who are widows let her give them help so that the care of them does not come on the church and so it may give help to those who are truly widowed
Ti  Let rulers whose rule is good be honoured twice over specially those whose work is preaching and teaching
Ti  For the Writings say It is not right to keep the ox from taking the grain when he is crushing it And The worker has a right to his reward
Ti  Do not take as true any statement made against one in authority but only if two or three give witness to it
Ti  Say sharp words to sinners when all are present so that the rest may be in fear
Ti  I give you orders before God and Christ Jesus and the angels of Gods selection to keep these orders without giving thought to one side more than another
Ti  Do not put hands on any man without thought and have no part in other mens sins keep yourself clean
Ti  Do not take only water as your drink but take a little wine for the good of your stomach and because you are frequently ill
Ti  The sins of some men are clearly seen going before them to be judged but with others their sins go after them
Ti  In the same way there are good works which are clearly seen and those which are not so may not be kept secret
Ti  Let all who are servants under the yoke give all honour to their masters so that no evil may be said against the name of God and his teaching
Ti  And let those whose masters are of the faith have respect for them because they are brothers working for them the more readily because those who take part in the good work are of the faith and are dear Give orders and teaching about these things
Ti  If any man gives different teaching not in agreement with the true words of our Lord Jesus Christ and with the teaching which is in agreement with true religion
Ti  He has an overhigh opinion of himself being without knowledge having only an unhealthy love of questionings and wars of words from which come envy fighting cruel words evil thoughts
Ti  Bitter talk of men who being evil in mind and dead to what is true take the faith to be a way of making profit
Ti  But true faith with peace of mind is of great profit
Ti  For we came into the world with nothing and we are not able to take anything out
Ti  But if we have food and a roof over us let that be enough
Ti  But those who have a desire for wealth are falling into danger and are taken as in a net by a number of foolish and damaging desires through which men are overtaken by death and destruction
Ti  For the love of money is a root of all evil and some whose hearts were fixed on it have been turned away from the faith and been wounded with unnumbered sorrows
Ti  But you O man of God keep yourself from these things and go after righteousness religion faith love a quiet mind gentle behaviour
Ti  Be fighting the good fight of the faith take for yourself the life eternal for which you were marked out and of which you gave witness in the eyes of all
Ti  I give you orders before God the giver of life and Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate gave witness to the faith
Ti  To keep the word untouched by evil clear from all shame till the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ
Ti  Which at the right time he will make clear who is the eternal and only Ruler King of kings and Lord of lords
Ti  Who only has life for ever living in light to which no man may come near whom no man has seen or is able to see to whom be honour and power for ever So be it
Ti  Give orders to those who have money and goods in this life not to be lifted up in their minds or to put their hope in the uncertain chances of wealth but in God who gives us in full measure all things for our use
Ti  And to do good having wealth in good works being quick to give taking part with one another
Ti  Making ready for themselves a safe place for the time to come so that the true life may be theirs
Ti  O Timothy take good care of that which is given to you turning away from the wrong and foolish talk and arguments of that knowledge which is falsely so named
Ti  Through which some who gave their minds to it have been turned away from the faith Grace be with you
Ti  Paul an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the purpose of God in the hope of the life which is in Christ Jesus
Ti  To Timothy my wellloved child Grace mercy peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord
Ti  I give praise to God whose servant I have been with a heart free from sin from the time of my fathers because in my prayers at all times the thought of you is with me night and day
Ti  Desiring to see you keeping in my memory your weeping so that I may be full of joy
Ti  Having in mind your true faith which first was in your mothers mother Lois and in your mother Eunice and I am certain is now in you
Ti  For this reason I say to you Let that grace of God which is in you given to you by my hands have living power
Ti  For God did not give us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of selfcontrol
Ti  Have no feeling of shame then for the witness of our Lord or for me his prisoner but undergo all things for the good news in the measure of the power of God
Ti  Who gave us salvation marking us out for his purpose not on account of our works but in the measure of his purpose and his grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal
Ti  But has now been made clear by the revelation of our Saviour Christ Jesus who put an end to death and made life unending come to light through the good news
Ti  Of which I was made a preacher and an Apostle and a teacher
Ti  And for which I undergo these things but I have no feeling of shame For I have knowledge of him in whom I have faith and I am certain that he is able to keep that which I have given into his care till that day
Ti  Keep the form of those true words which you had from me in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus
Ti  That good thing which was given to you keep safe through the Holy Spirit which is in us
Ti  You have had news that all those in Asia went away from me among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes
Ti  May the Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus because he frequently gave me help and had no feeling of shame because I was in chains
Ti  But when he was in Rome he went in search of me everywhere and came to me
Ti  May he have the Lords mercy in that day and of all he did for me at Ephesus you have full knowledge
Ti  So then my child be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus
Ti  And the things which I have said to you before a number of witnesses give to those of the faith so that they may be teachers of others
Ti  Be ready to do without the comforts of life as one of the army of Christ Jesus
Ti  A fighting man when he is with the army keeps himself free from the business of this life so that he may be pleasing to him who has taken him into his army
Ti  And if a man takes part in a competition he does not get the crown if he has not kept the rules
Ti  It is right for the worker in the fields to be the first to take of the fruit
Ti  Give thought to what I say for the Lord will give you wisdom in all things
Ti  Keep in mind Jesus Christ of the seed of David who came back from the dead as my good news gives witness
Ti  In which I put up with the hardest conditions even prison chains like one who has done a crime but the word of God is not in chains
Ti  But I undergo all things for the saints so that they may have salvation in Christ Jesus with eternal glory
Ti  This is a true saying If we undergo death with him then will we be living with him
Ti  If we go on to the end then we will be ruling with him if we say we have no knowledge of him then he will say he has no knowledge of us
Ti  If we are without faith still he keeps faith for he will never be untrue to himself
Ti  Put these things before them giving them orders in the name of the Lord to keep themselves from fighting about words which is of no profit only causing error in their hearers
Ti  Let it be your care to get the approval of God as a workman who has no cause for shame giving the true word in the right way
Ti  But take no part in wrong and foolish talk for those who do so will go farther into evil
Ti  And their words will be like poisoned wounds in the flesh such are Hymenaeus and Philetus
Ti  Men whose ideas are all false who say that the coming back from the dead has even now taken place overturning the faith of some
Ti  But Gods strong base is unchanging having this sign The Lord has knowledge of those who are his and Let everyone by whom the name of the Lord is named be turned away from evil
Ti  Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but others of wood and earth and some which are honoured and some without honour
Ti  If a man makes himself clean from these he will be a vessel for honour made holy ready for the masters use ready for every good work
Ti  But keep yourself from those desires of the flesh which are strong when the body is young and go after righteousness faith love peace with those whose prayers go up to the Lord from a clean heart
Ti  And put away foolish and uncontrolled questionings seeing that they are a cause of trouble
Ti  For it is not right for the Lords servant to make trouble but he is to be gentle to all ready in teaching putting up with wrong
Ti  Gently guiding those who go against the teaching if by chance God may give them a change of heart and true knowledge
Ti  And so they may get themselves free from the net of the Evil One being made the prisoners of the Lords servant for the purpose of God
Ti  But be certain of this that in the last days times of trouble will come
Ti  For men will be lovers of self lovers of money uplifted in pride given to bitter words going against the authority of their fathers never giving praise having no religion
Ti  Without natural love bitter haters saying evil of others violent and uncontrolled hating all good
Ti  False to their friends acting without thought lifted up in mind loving pleasure more than God
Ti  Having a form of religion but turning their backs on the power of it go not with these
Ti  For these are they who go secretly into houses making prisoners of foolish women weighted down with sin turned from the way by their evil desires
Ti  Ever learning and never coming to the knowledge of what is true
Ti  And as James and Jambres went against Moses so do these go against what is true men of evil minds who tested by faith are seen to be false
Ti  But they will go no farther for their foolish behaviour will be clear to all men as theirs was in the end
Ti  But you took as your example my teaching behaviour purpose and faith my long waiting my love my quiet undergoing of trouble
Ti  My punishments and pain the things which came to me at Antioch at Iconium at Lystra the cruel attacks made on me and the Lord made me free from them all
Ti  Yes and all whose purpose is to be living in the knowledge of God in Christ Jesus will be cruelly attacked
Ti  Evil and false men will become worse and worse using deceit and themselves overcome by deceit
Ti  But see that you keep to the teaching you have been given and the things of which you are certain conscious of who has been your teacher
Ti  And that from the time when you were a child you have had knowledge of the holy Writings which are able to make you wise to salvation through faith in Christ Jesus
Ti  Every holy Writing which comes from God is of profit for teaching for training for guiding for education in righteousness
Ti  So that the man of God may be complete trained and made ready for every good work
Ti  I give you orders before God and Christ Jesus who will be the judge of the living and the dead and by his revelation and his kingdom
Ti  Be preaching the word at all times in every place make protests say sharp words give comfort with long waiting and teaching
Ti  For the time will come when they will not take the true teaching but moved by their desires they will get for themselves a great number of teachers for the pleasure of hearing them
Ti  And shutting their ears to what is true will be turned away to belief in foolish stories
Ti  But be selfcontrolled in all things do without comfort go on preaching the good news completing the work which has been given you to do
Ti  For I am even now being offered and my end is near
Ti  I have made a good fight I have come to the end of my journey I have kept the faith
Ti  From now on the crown of righteousness is made ready for me which the Lord the upright judge Will give to me at that day and not only to me but to all those who have had love for his revelation
Ti  Do your best to come to me before long
Ti  For Demas has gone away from me for love of this present life and has gone to Thessalonica Crescens has gone to Galatia Titus to Dalmatia
Ti  Only Luke is with me Get Mark and take him with you for he is of use to me in the work
Ti  Tychicus I sent to Ephesus
Ti  The coat which I did not take from Troas and which is with Carpus get when you come and the books specially the papers
Ti  Alexander the copperworker did me much wrong the Lord will give him the reward of his works
Ti  But be on the watch for him for he was violent in his attacks on our teaching
Ti  At my first meeting with my judges no one took my part but all went away from me May it not be put to their account
Ti  But the Lord was by my side and gave me strength so that through me the news might be given out in full measure and all the Gentiles might give ear and I was taken out of the mouth of the lion
Ti  The Lord will keep me safe from every evil work and will give me salvation in his kingdom in heaven to whom be glory for ever and ever So be it
Ti  Give my love to Prisca and Aquila and those of the house of Onesiphorus
Ti  Erastus was stopping at Corinth but Trophimus when I last saw him was at Miletus ill
Ti  Do your best to come before the winter Eubulus sends you his love and Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brothers
Ti  The Lord be with your spirit Grace be with you
Tit  Paul a servant of God and an Apostle of Jesus Christ in agreement with the faith of the saints of God and the full knowledge of what is true in harmony with religion
Tit  In the hope of eternal life which was made certain before eternal time by the word of God who is ever true
Tit  Who in his time made clear his word in the good news of which by the order of God our Saviour I became a preacher
Tit  To Titus my true child in our common faith Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour
Tit  I did not take you with me when I went away from Crete so that you might do what was necessary to put things in order there placing men in authority over the churches in every town as I said to you
Tit  Men having a good record husbands of one wife whose children are of the faith children of whom it may not be said that they are given to loose living or are uncontrolled
Tit  For it is necessary for a Bishop to be a man of virtue as Gods servant not pushing himself forward not quickly moved to wrath or blows not desiring profit for himself
Tit  But opening his house freely to guests a lover of what is good seriousminded upright holy selfcontrolled
Tit  Keeping to the true word of the teaching so that he may be able to give comfort by right teaching and overcome the arguments of the doubters
Tit  For there are men who are not ruled by law foolish talkers false teachers specially those of the circumcision
Tit  By whom some families have been completely overturned who take money for teaching things which are not right these will have to be stopped
Tit  One of their prophets has said The men of Crete are ever false evil beasts lovers of food hating work
Tit  This witness is true So say sharp words to them so that they may come to the right faith
Tit  Giving no attention to the fictions of the Jews and the rules of men who have no true knowledge
Tit  To the clean in heart all things are clean but to those who are unclean and without faith nothing is clean they become unclean in mind and in thought
Tit  They say that they have knowledge of God while by their acts they are turning their backs on him they are hated by all hardhearted and judged to be without value for any good work
Tit  But let your words be in agreement with true and right teaching
Tit  That old men are to be simple in their tastes serious wise true in faith in love and of a quiet mind
Tit  That old women are to be selfrespecting in behaviour not saying evil of others not given to taking much wine teachers of that which is good
Tit  Training the younger women to have love for their husbands and children
Tit  To be wise in mind clean in heart kind working in their houses living under the authority of their husbands so that no evil may be said of the word of God
Tit  To the young men give orders to be wise and seriousminded
Tit  In all things see that you are an example of good works holy in your teaching serious in behaviour
Tit  Saying true and right words against which no protest may be made so that he who is not on our side may be put to shame unable to say any evil of us
Tit  Servants are to be under the authority of their masters pleasing them in all things without argument
Tit  Not taking what is not theirs but giving clear signs of their good faith in all things doing credit to the teaching of God our Saviour
Tit  For the grace of God has come giving salvation to all men
Tit  Training us so that turning away from evil and the desires of this world we may be living wisely and uprightly in the knowledge of God in this present life
Tit  Looking for the glad hope the revelation of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ
Tit  Who gave himself for us so that he might make us free from all wrongdoing and make for himself a people clean in heart and on fire with good works
Tit  On all these points give teaching and help and make clear what is right with all authority Let all men give you honour
Tit  Make clear to them that they are to put themselves under rulers and authorities to do what they are ordered to be ready for every good work
Tit  To say no evil of any man not to be fighters to give way to others to be gentle in behaviour to all men
Tit  For in the past we were foolish hard in heart turned from the true way servants of evil desires and pleasures living in bad feeling and envy hated and hating one another
Tit  But when the mercy of God our Saviour and his love to man was seen
Tit  Not by works of righteousness which we did ourselves but in the measure of his mercy he gave us salvation through the washing of the new birth and the giving of new life in the Holy Spirit
Tit  Which he gave us freely through Jesus Christ our Saviour
Tit  So that having been given righteousness through grace we might have a part in the heritage the hope of eternal life
Tit  This is a true saying and it is my desire that you may give certain witness about these things so that those who have had faith in God may give attention to good works These things are good and of profit to men
Tit  But have nothing to do with foolish questionings and lists of generations and fights and arguments about the law for they are of no profit and foolish
Tit  A man whose opinions are not those of the church after a first and second protest is to be kept out of your society
Tit  Clearly he is in error and a sinner being selfjudged
Tit  When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you do your best to come to me at Nicopolis for it is my purpose to be there for the winter
Tit  Send Zenas the man of law and Apollos on their journey with all care so that they may be in need of nothing
Tit  And let our people go on with good works for necessary purposes so that they may not be without fruit
Tit  All who are with me send you their love Give our love to our friends in the faith Grace be with you all
Phm  Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ and Timothy our brother to Philemon our dear helper in the faith
Phm  And to Apphia our sister and to Archippus our brother in Gods army and to the church in your house
Phm  Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
Phm  I give praise to God at all times and make prayer for you
Phm  Hearing of the love and the faith which you have to the Lord Jesus and to all the saints
Phm  That the faith which you have in common with them may be working with power in the knowledge of every good thing in you for Christ
Phm  For I had great joy and comfort in your love because the hearts of the saints have been made strong again through you brother
Phm  And so though I might in the name of Christ give you orders to do what is right
Phm  Still because of love in place of an order I make a request to you I Paul an old man and now a prisoner of Christ Jesus
Phm  My request is for my child Onesimus the child of my chains
Phm  Who in the past was of no profit to you but now is of profit to you and to me
Phm  Whom I have sent back to you him who is my very heart
Phm  Though my desire was to keep him with me to be my servant in the chains of the good news in your place
Phm  But without your approval I would do nothing so that your good works might not be forced but done freely from your heart
Phm  For it is possible that for this reason he was parted from you for a time so that you might have him for ever
Phm  No longer as a servant but more than a servant a brother very dear to me specially but much more to you in the flesh as well as in the Lord
Phm  If then you take me to be your friend and brother take him in as myself
Phm  If he has done you any wrong or is in debt to you for anything put it to my account
Phm  I Paul writing this myself say I will make payment to you and I do not say to you that you are in debt to me even for your life
Phm  So brother let me have joy of you in the Lord give new life to my heart in Christ
Phm  Being certain that you will do my desire I am writing to you in the knowledge that you will do even more than I say
Phm  And make a room ready for me for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be given to you
Phm  Epaphras my brotherprisoner in Christ Jesus sends you his love
Phm  And so do Mark Aristarchus Demas and Luke my brotherworkers
Phm  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit So be it
Heb  In times past the word of God came to our fathers through the prophets in different parts and in different ways
Heb  But now at the end of these days it has come to us through his Son to whom he has given all things for a heritage and through whom he made the order of the generations
Heb  Who being the outshining of his glory the true image of his substance supporting all things by the word of his power having given himself as an offering making clean from sins took his seat at the right hand of God in heaven
Heb  Having become by so much better than the angels as the name which is his heritage is more noble than theirs
Heb  To which of the angels did God say at any time You are my Son this day I have given you being or I will be his Father and he will be my Son
Heb  And again when he is sending his only Son into the world he says Let all the angels of God give him worship
Heb  And of the angels he says Who makes his angels winds and his servants flames of fire
Heb  But of the Son he says Your seat of power O God is for ever and ever and the rod of your kingdom is a rod of righteousness
Heb  You have been a lover of righteousness and a hater of evil and so God your God has put the oil of joy on your head more than on the heads of those who are with you
Heb  You Lord at the first did put the earth on its base and the heavens are the works of your hands
Heb  They will come to their end but you are for ever they will become old as a robe
Heb  They will be rolled up like a cloth even like a robe and they will be changed but you are the same and your years will have no end
Heb  But of which of the angels has he said at any time Take your seat at my right hand till I put all those who are against you under your feet
Heb  Are they not all helping spirits who are sent out as servants to those whose heritage will be salvation
Heb  For this reason there is the more need for us to give attention to the things which have come to our ears for fear that by chance we might be slipping away
Heb  Because if the word which came through the angels was fixed and in the past every evil act against Gods orders was given its full punishment
Heb  What will come on us if we do not give our minds to such a great salvation a salvation of which our fathers first had knowledge through the words of the Lord and which was made certain to us by those to whom his words came
Heb  And God was a witness with them by signs and wonders and by more than natural powers and by his distribution of the Holy Spirit at his pleasure
Heb  For he did not make the angels rulers over the world to come of which I am writing
Heb  But a certain writer has given his witness saying What is man that you keep him in mind what is the son of man that you take him into account
Heb  You made him a little lower than the angels you gave him a crown of glory and honour and made him ruler over all the works of your hands
Heb  You put all things under his feet For in making man the ruler over all things God did not put anything outside his authority though we do not see everything under him now
Heb  But we see him who was made a little lower than the angels even Jesus crowned with glory and honour because he let himself be put to death so that by the grace of God he might undergo death for all men
Heb  Because it was right for him for whom and through whom all things have being in guiding his sons to glory to make the captain of their salvation complete through pain
Heb  For he who makes holy and those who are made holy are all of one family and for this reason it is no shame for him to give them the name of brothers
Heb  Saying I will give the knowledge of your name to my brothers I will make a song of praise to you before the church
Heb  And again he says I will put my faith in him And again See I am here and the children which God has given to me
Heb  And because the children are flesh and blood he took a body himself and became like them so that by his death he might put an end to him who had the power of death that is to say the Evil One
Heb  And let those who all their lives were in chains because of their fear of death go free
Heb  For truly he does not take on the life of angels but that of the seed of Abraham
Heb  Because of this it was necessary for him to be made like his brothers in every way so that he might be a high priest full of mercy and keeping faith in everything to do with God making offerings for the sins of the people
Heb  For having been put to the test himself he is able to give help to others when they are tested
Heb  For this reason holy brothers marked out to have a part in heaven give thought to Jesus the representative and high priest of our faith
Heb  Who kept faith with God who gave him his place even as Moses did in all his house
Heb  And it was right for this man to have more honour than Moses even as the builder of a house has more honour than the house
Heb  For every house has a builder but the builder of all things is God
Heb  And Moses certainly kept faith as a servant in all his house and as a witness of those things which were to be said later
Heb  But Christ as a son over his house whose house are we if we keep our hearts fixed in the glad and certain hope till the end
Heb  And so as the Holy Spirit says Today if you let his voice come to your ears
Heb  Be not hard of heart as when you made me angry on the day of testing in the waste land
Heb  When your fathers put me to the test and saw my works for forty years
Heb  So that I was angry with this generation and I said Their hearts are in error at all times and they have no knowledge of my ways
Heb  And being angry I made an oath saying They may not come into my rest
Heb  My brothers take care that there is not by chance in any one of you an evil heart without belief turning away from the living God
Heb  But give comfort to one another every day as long as it is still Today so that no one among you may be made hard by the deceit of sin
Heb  For if we keep the substance of the faith which we had at the start even till the end we have a part with Christ
Heb  As it is said Today if you will let his voice come to your ears be not hard of heart as when you made him angry
Heb  Who made him angry when his voice came to them was it not all those who came out of Egypt with Moses
Heb  And with whom was he angry for forty years was it not with those who did evil who came to their deaths in the waste land
Heb  And to whom did he make an oath that they might not come into his rest was it not to those who went against his orders
Heb  So we see that they were not able to go in because they had no belief
Heb  Let us then though we still have Gods word that we may come into his rest go in fear that some of you may be unable to do so
Heb  And truly the good news came to us even as it did to them but the hearing of the word did them no good because they were not united in faith with the true hearers
Heb  For those of us who have belief come into his rest even as he has said As I said in my oath when I was angry They may not come into my rest though the works were done from the time of the making of the world
Heb  For in one place he has said of the seventh day And God had rest from all his works on the seventh day
Heb  And in the same place he says again They will not come into my rest
Heb  So that as it is clear that some have to go in and that the first hearers of the good news were not able to go in because they went against Gods orders
Heb  After a long time again naming a certain day he says in David Today as he had said before Today if you will let his voice come to your ears be not hard of heart
Heb  For if Joshua had given them rest he would not have said anything about another day
Heb  So that there is still a Sabbathkeeping for the people of God
Heb  For the man who comes into his rest has had rest from his works as God did from his
Heb  Because of this let us have a strong desire to come into that rest and let no one go after the example of those who went against Gods orders
Heb  For the word of God is living and full of power and is sharper than any twoedged sword cutting through and making a division even of the soul and the spirit the bones and the muscles and quick to see the thoughts and purposes of the heart
Heb  And there is nothing made which is not completely clear to him there is nothing covered but all things are open to the eyes of him with whom we have to do
Heb  Having then a great high priest who has made his way through the heavens even Jesus the Son of God let us be strong in our faith
Heb  For we have not a high priest who is not able to be touched by the feelings of our feeble flesh but we have one who has been tested in all points as we ourselves are tested but without sin
Heb  Then let us come near to the seat of grace without fear so that mercy may be given to us and we may get grace for our help in time of need
Heb  Every high priest who is taken from among men is given his position to take care of the interests of men in those things which have to do with God so that he may make offerings for sins
Heb  He is able to have feeling for those who have no knowledge and for those who are wandering from the true way because he himself is feeble
Heb  And being feeble he has to make sinofferings for himself as well as for the people
Heb  And no man who is not given authority by God as Aaron was takes this honour for himself
Heb  In the same way Christ did not take for himself the glory of being made a high priest but was given it by him who said You are my Son this day I have given you being
Heb  As he says in another place You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek
Heb  Who in the days of his flesh having sent up prayers and requests with strong crying and weeping to him who was able to give him salvation from death had his prayer answered because of his fear of God
Heb  And though he was a Son through the pain which he underwent the knowledge came to him of what it was to be under Gods orders
Heb  And when he had been made complete he became the giver of eternal salvation to all those who are under his orders
Heb  Being named by God a high priest of the order of Melchizedek
Heb  Of whom we have much to say which it is hard to make clear because you are slow of hearing
Heb  And though by this time it would be right for you to be teachers you still have need of someone to give you teaching about the first simple rules of Gods revelation you have become like babies who have need of milk and not of solid food
Heb  For everyone who takes milk is without experience of the word of righteousness he is a child
Heb  But solid food is for men of full growth even for those whose senses are trained by use to see what is good and what is evil
Heb  For this reason let us go on from the first things about Christ to full growth not building again that on which it is based that is the turning of the heart from dead works and faith in God
Heb  The teaching of baptisms and of the putting on of hands and of the future life of the dead and of the judging on the last day
Heb  Now we will do this if God lets us
Heb  As for those who at one time saw the light tasting the good things from heaven and having their part in the Holy Spirit
Heb  With knowledge of the good word of God and of the powers of the coming time
Heb  And then let themselves be turned away it is not possible for their hearts to be made new a second time because they themselves put the Son of God on the cross again openly shaming him
Heb  For a land drinking in the frequent rain and producing good plants for those for whom it is worked has a blessing from God
Heb  But if it sends up thorns and evil plants it is of no use and is ready to be cursed its only end is to be burned
Heb  But my loved ones though we say this we are certain that you have better things in you things which go with salvation
Heb  For God is true and will not put away from him the memory of your work and of your love for his name in the help which you gave and still give to the saints
Heb  And it is our desire that you may all keep the same high purpose in certain hope to the end
Heb  So that you may not be slow in heart but may take as your example those to whom God has given their heritage because of their faith and their long waiting
Heb  For when God made his oath to Abraham because there was no greater oath he made it by himself
Heb  Saying Be certain that I will give you my blessing and make your numbers very great
Heb  And so when he had been waiting calmly for a long time Gods word to him was put into effect
Heb  For men at all times make their oaths by what is greater and any argument is ended by the decision of the oath
Heb  So that when it was Gods desire to make it specially clear to those who by his word were to have the heritage that his purpose was fixed he made it more certain with an oath
Heb  So that we who have gone in flight from danger to the hope which has been put before us may have a strong comfort in two unchanging things in which it is not possible for God to be false
Heb  And this hope is like a strong band for our souls fixed and certain and going in to that which is inside the veil
Heb  Where Jesus has gone before us as a high priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek
Heb  For this Melchizedek the king of Salem a priest of the Most High God who gave Abraham his blessing meeting him when he came back after putting the kings to death
Heb  And to whom Abraham gave a tenth part of everything which he had being first named King of righteousness and then in addition King of Salem that is to say King of peace
Heb  Being without father or mother or family having no birth or end to his life being made like the Son of God is a priest for ever
Heb  Now see how great this man was to whom our father Abraham gave a tenth part of what he had got in the fight
Heb  And it is true that by the law those of the sons of Levi who have the position of priests may take a tenth part of the peoples goods that is to say they take it from their brothers though these are the sons of Abraham
Heb  But this man who was not of their family took the tenth from Abraham and gave a blessing to him to whom God had given his undertaking
Heb  But there is no doubt that the less gets his blessing from the greater
Heb  Now at the present time men over whom death has power take the tenth but then it was taken by one of whom it is witnessed that he is living
Heb  And we may say that in Abraham even Levi who has a right to take the tenth part gave it
Heb  Because he was still in his fathers body when Melchizedek came to him
Heb  Now if it was possible for things to be made complete through the priests of the house of Levi for the law was given to the people in connection with them what need was there for another priest who was of the order of Melchizedek and not of the order of Aaron
Heb  Because if the priests are changed it is necessary to make a change in the law
Heb  For he of whom these things are said comes of another tribe of which no man has ever made offerings at the altar
Heb  Because it is clear that our Lord comes out of Judah and Moses said nothing about priests from that tribe
Heb  And this is even more clear if a second priest has come up who is like Melchizedek
Heb  That is to say not made by a law based on the flesh but by the power of a life without end
Heb  For it has been witnessed of him You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek
Heb  So the law which went before is put on one side because it was feeble and without profit
Heb  Because the law made nothing complete and in its place there is a better hope through which we come near to God
Heb  And as this is not without the taking of an oath
Heb  For those were made priests without an oath but this one was made a priest with an oath by him who says of him The Lord gave his oath which he will not take back that you are a priest for ever
Heb  By so much is it a better agreement which we have through Jesus
Heb  And it is true that there have been a great number of those priests because death does not let them go on for ever
Heb  But this priest because his life goes on for ever is unchanging
Heb  So that he is fully able to be the saviour of all who come to God through him because he is ever living to make prayer to God for them
Heb  It was right for us to have such a high priest one who is holy and without evil doing no wrong having no part with sinners and made higher than the heavens
Heb  Who has no need to make offerings for sins every day like those high priests first for himself and then for the people because he did this once and for ever when he made an offering of himself
Heb  The law makes high priests of men who are feeble but the word of the oath which was made after the law gives that position to a Son in whom all good is for ever complete
Heb  Now of the things we are saying this is the chief point We have such a high priest who has taken his place at the right hand of Gods high seat of glory in heaven
Heb  As a servant of the holy things and of the true Tent which was put up by God not by man
Heb  Now every high priest is given authority to take to God the things which are given and to make offerings so that it is necessary for this man like them to have something for an offering
Heb  If he had been on earth he would not have been a priest at all because there are other priests who make the offerings ordered by the law
Heb  Being servants of that which is a copy and an image of the things in heaven as Moses when he was about to make the Tent had special orders from God for See he said that you make everything like the design which you saw in the mountain
Heb  But now his position as priest is higher because through him God has made a better agreement with man based on the giving of better things
Heb  For if that first agreement had been as good as possible there would have been no place for a second
Heb  For protesting against them he says See the days are coming when I will make a new agreement with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah
Heb  Not like the agreement which I made with their fathers when I took them by the hand to be their guide out of the land of Egypt for they did not keep the agreement with me and I gave them up says the Lord
Heb  For this is the agreement which I will make with the people of Israel after those days I will put my laws into their minds writing them in their hearts and I will be their God and they will be my people
Heb  And there will be no need for every man to be teaching his brother or his neighbour saying This is the knowledge of the Lord for they will all have knowledge of me great and small
Heb  And I will have mercy on their evildoing and I will not keep their sins in mind
Heb  When he says A new agreement he has made the first agreement old But anything which is getting old and past use will not be seen much longer
Heb  Now the first agreement had its rules of worship and a holy order
Heb  For the first Tent was made ready having in it the vessels for the lights and the table and the ordering of the bread and this is named the holy place
Heb  And inside the second veil was the place which is named the Holy of holies
Heb  Having a vessel of gold in it for burning perfumes and the ark of the agreement which was covered with gold and which had in it a pot made of gold for the manna and Aarons rod which put out buds and the stones with the writing of the agreement
Heb  And over it were the winged ones of glory with their wings covering the mercyseat about which it is not possible now to say anything in detail
Heb  Now while these things were in existence the priests went into the first Tent at all times for prayer and the making of offerings
Heb  But only the high priest went into the second once a year not without making an offering of blood for himself and for the errors of the people
Heb  The Holy Spirit witnessing by this that the way into the holy place had not at that time been made open while the first Tent was still in being
Heb  And this is an image of the present time when the offerings which are given are not able to make the heart of the worshipper completely clean
Heb  Because they are only rules of the flesh of meats and drinks and washings which have their place till the time comes when things will be put right
Heb  But now Christ has come as the high priest of the good things of the future through this greater and better Tent not made with hands that is to say not of this world
Heb  And has gone once and for ever into the holy place having got eternal salvation not through the blood of goats and young oxen but through his blood
Heb  For if the blood of goats and oxen and the dust from the burning of a young cow being put on the unclean make the flesh clean
Heb  How much more will the blood of Christ who being without sin made an offering of himself to God through the Holy Spirit make your hearts clean from dead works to be servants of the living God
Heb  And for this cause it is through him that a new agreement has come into being so that after the errors under the first agreement had been taken away by his death the word of God might have effect for those who were marked out for an eternal heritage
Heb  Because where there is a testament there has to be the death of the man who made it
Heb  For a testament has effect after death for what power has it while the man who made it is living
Heb  So that even the first agreement was not made without blood
Heb  For when Moses had given all the rules of the law to the people he took the blood of goats and young oxen with water and red wool and hyssop and put it on the book itself and on all the people
Heb  Saying This blood is the sign of the agreement which God has made with you
Heb  And the blood was put on the Tent and all the holy vessels in the same way
Heb  And by the law almost all things are made clean with blood and without blood there is no forgiveness
Heb  For this cause it was necessary to make the copies of the things in heaven clean with these offerings but the things themselves are made clean with better offerings than these
Heb  For Christ did not go into a holy place which had been made by mens hands as the copy of the true one but he went into heaven itself and now takes his place before the face of God for us
Heb  And he did not have to make an offering of himself again and again as the high priest goes into the holy place every year with blood which is not his
Heb  For then he would have undergone a number of deaths from the time of the making of the world but now he has come to us at the end of the old order to put away sin by the offering of himself
Heb  And because by Gods law death comes to men once and after that they are judged
Heb  So Christ having at his first coming taken on himself the sins of men will be seen a second time without sin by those who are waiting for him for their salvation
Heb  For the law being only a poor copy of the future good things and not the true image of those things is never able to make the people who come to the altar every year with the same offerings completely clean
Heb  For if this had been possible would there not have been an end of those offerings because the worshippers would have been made completely clean and would have been no longer conscious of sins
Heb  But year by year there is a memory of sins in those offerings
Heb  Because it is not possible for the blood of oxen and goats to take away sins
Heb  So that when he comes into the world he says You had no desire for offerings but you made a body ready for me
Heb  You had no joy in burned offerings or in offerings for sin
Heb  Then I said See I have come to do your pleasure O God as it is said of me in the roll of the book
Heb  After saying You had no desire for offerings for burned offerings or offerings for sin which are made by the law and you had no pleasure in them
Heb  Then he said See I have come to do your pleasure He took away the old order so that he might put the new order in its place
Heb  By that pleasure we have been made holy by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once and for ever
Heb  And every priest takes his place at the altar day by day doing what is necessary and making again and again the same offerings which are never able to take away sins
Heb  But when Jesus had made one offering for sins for ever he took his place at the right hand of God
Heb  And has been waiting there from that time till all who are against him are made a footrest for his feet
Heb  Because by one offering he has made complete for ever those who are made holy
Heb  And the Holy Spirit is a witness for us for after he had said
Heb  This is the agreement which I will make with them after those days says the Lord I will put my laws in their hearts writing them in their minds he said
Heb  And I will keep no more memory of their sins and of their evildoings
Heb  Now where there is forgiveness of these there is no more offering for sin
Heb  So then my brothers being able to go into the holy place without fear because of the blood of Jesus
Heb  By the new and living way which he made open for us through the veil that is to say his flesh
Heb  And having a great priest over the house of God
Heb  Let us go in with true hearts in certain faith having our hearts made free from the sense of sin and our bodies washed with clean water
Heb  Let us keep the witness of our hope strong and unshaking for he is true who has given his word
Heb  And let us be moving one another at all times to love and good works
Heb  Not giving up our meetings as is the way of some but keeping one another strong in faith and all the more because you see the day coming near
Heb  For if we do evil on purpose after we have had the knowledge of what is true there is no more offering for sins
Heb  But only a great fear of being judged and of the fire of wrath which will be the destruction of the haters of God
Heb  A man who has gone against the law of Moses is put to death without pity on the word of two or three witnesses
Heb  But will not the man by whom the Son of God has been crushed under foot and the blood of the agreement with which he was washed clean has been taken as an unholy thing and who has had no respect for the Spirit of grace be judged bad enough for a very much worse punishment
Heb  For we have had experience of him who says Punishment is mine I will give reward And again The Lord will be judge of his people
Heb  We may well go in fear of falling into the hands of the living God
Heb  But give thought to the days after you had seen the light when you went through a great war of troubles
Heb  In part in being attacked by angry words and cruel acts before the eyes of everyone and in part in being united with those who were attacked in this way
Heb  For you had pity on those who were in prison and had joy in the loss of your property in the knowledge that you still had a better property and one which you would keep for ever
Heb  So do not give up your hope which will be greatly rewarded
Heb  For having done what was right in Gods eyes you have need of waiting before his word has effect for you
Heb  In a very little time he who is coming will come he will not be slow
Heb  But the upright man will be living by his faith and if he goes back my soul will have no pleasure in him
Heb  But we are not of those who go back to destruction but of those who have faith even to the salvation of the soul
Heb  Now faith is the substance of things hoped for and the sign that the things not seen are true
Heb  For by it our fathers had Gods approval
Heb  By faith it is clear to us that the order of events was fixed by the word of God so that what is seen has not been made from things which only seem to be
Heb  By faith Abel made a better offering to God than Cain and he had witness through it of his righteousness God giving his approval of his offering and his voice still comes to us through it though he is dead
Heb  By faith Enoch was taken up to heaven so that he did not see death he was seen no longer for God took him away for before he was taken witness had been given that he was wellpleasing to God
Heb  And without faith it is not possible to be wellpleasing to him for it is necessary for anyone who comes to God to have the belief that God is and that he is a rewarder of all those who make a serious search for him
Heb  By faith Noah being moved by the fear of God made ready an ark for the salvation of his family because God had given him news of things which were not seen at the time and through it the world was judged by him and he got for his heritage the righteousness which is by faith
Heb  By faith Abraham did as God said when he was ordered to go out into a place which was to be given to him as a heritage and went out without knowledge of where he was going
Heb  By faith he was a wanderer in the land of the agreement as in a strange land living in tents with Isaac and Jacob who had a part with him in the same heritage
Heb  For he was looking for the strong town whose builder and maker is God
Heb  And by faith Sarah herself had power to give birth when she was very old because she had faith in him who gave his word
Heb  So that from one man who was near to death came children in number as the stars in heaven or as the sand by the seaside which may not be numbered
Heb  All these came to their end in faith not having had the heritage but having seen it with delight far away they gave witness that they were wanderers and not of the earth
Heb  For those who say such things make it clear that they are searching for a country for themselves
Heb  And truly if they had kept in mind the country from which they went out they would have had chances of turning back
Heb  But now their desire is for a better country that is to say for one in heaven and so it is no shame to God to be named their God for he has made ready a town for them
Heb  By faith Abraham made an offering of Isaac when he was tested and he with whom the agreement had been made gave up as an offering the only son of his body
Heb  Of whom it had been said From Isaac will your seed take their name
Heb  Judging that God was able to give life even to the dead and because of this he did get him back as if from death
Heb  By faith Isaac blessing Jacob and Esau gave news of things to come
Heb  By faith Jacob gave a blessing to the two sons of Joseph when he was near to death and gave God worship supported by his stick
Heb  By faith Joseph when his end was near said that the children of Israel would go out of Egypt and gave orders about his bones
Heb  By faith Moses was kept secretly by his father and mother for three months after his birth because they saw that he was a fair child and they had no fear of the kings orders
Heb  By faith Moses when he became a man had no desire to be named the son of Pharaohs daughter
Heb  Feeling that it was better to undergo pain with the people of God than for a short time to have a taste of the pleasures of sin
Heb  Judging a part in the shame of Christ to be better than all the wealth of Egypt for he was looking forward to his reward
Heb  By faith he went out of Egypt not being turned from his purpose by fear of the wrath of the king for he kept on his way as seeing him who is unseen
Heb  By faith he kept the Passover and put the sign of the blood on the houses so that the angel of destruction might not put their oldest sons to death
Heb  By faith they went through the Red Sea as if it had been dry land though the Egyptians were overcome by the water when they made an attempt to do the same
Heb  By faith the walls of Jericho came down after they had been circled for seven days
Heb  By faith Rahab the loose woman was not put to death with those who had gone against Gods orders because she had taken into her house in peace those sent to see the land
Heb  What more am I to say For there would not be time to give the stories of Gideon Barak Samson and Jephthah of David and Samuel and the prophets
Heb  Who through faith overcame kingdoms did righteousness got their reward kept the mouths of lions shut
Heb  Put out the power of fire got safely away from the edge of the sword were made strong when they had been feeble became full of power in war and put to flight the armies of the nations
Heb  Women had their dead given back to them living others let themselves be cruelly attacked having no desire to go free so that they might have a better life to come
Heb  And others were tested by being laughed at or by blows and even with chains and prisons
Heb  They were stoned they were cut up with knives they were tested they were put to death with the sword they went about in sheepskins and in goatskins being poor and in pain and cruelly attacked
Heb  Wandering in waste places and in mountains and in holes in the rocks for whom the world was not good enough
Heb  And not one of these got the good things of the agreement though they all had a good record through faith
Heb  Because God had kept some better thing for us so that it was not possible for them to become complete without us
Heb  For this reason as we are circled by so great a cloud of witnesses putting off every weight and the sin into which we come so readily let us keep on running in the way which is marked out for us
Heb  Having our eyes fixed on Jesus the guide and end of our faith who went through the pains of the cross not caring for the shame because of the joy which was before him and who has now taken his place at the right hand of Gods seat of power
Heb  Give thought to him who has undergone so much of the hate of sinners against himself so that you may not be tired and feeble of purpose
Heb  Till now you have not given your blood in your fight against sin
Heb  And you have not kept in mind the word which says to you as to sons My son do not make little of the Lords punishment and do not give up hope when you are judged by him
Heb  For the Lord sends punishment on his loved ones everyone whom he takes as his son has experience of his rod
Heb  It is for your training that you undergo these things God is acting to you as a father does to his sons for what son does not have punishment from his father
Heb  But if you have not that punishment of which we all have our part then you are not true sons but children of shame
Heb  And again if the fathers of our flesh gave us punishment and had our respect how much more will we be under the authority of the Father of spirits and have life
Heb  For they truly gave us punishment for a short time as it seemed good to them but he does it for our profit so that we may become holy as he is
Heb  At the time all punishment seems to be pain and not joy but after those who have been trained by it get from it the peacegiving fruit of righteousness
Heb  For this cause let the hands which are hanging down be lifted up and let the feeble knees be made strong
Heb  And make straight roads for your feet so that the feeble may not be turned out of the way but may be made strong
Heb  Let your desire be for peace with all men and to be made holy without which no man may see the Lord
Heb  Looking with care to see that no man among you in his behaviour comes short of the grace of God for fear that some bitter root may come up to be a trouble to you and that some of you may be made unclean by it
Heb  And that there may not be any evil liver or any man without respect for God like Esau who let his birthright go for a plate of food
Heb  For you have knowledge that even long after when he was desiring the blessing for his heritage he was turned away though he made his request frequently and with weeping because the past might not be changed
Heb  You have not come to a mountain which may be touched and is burning with fire and to a black cloud and a dark smoke and a violent wind
Heb  And to the sound of a horn and the voice of words the hearers of which made request that not a word more might be said to them
Heb  For the order which said If the mountain is touched even by a beast the beast is to be stoned seemed hard to them
Heb  And the vision was so overpowering that even Moses said I am shaking and full of fear
Heb  But you have come to the mountain of Zion to the place of the living God to the Jerusalem which is in heaven and to an army of angels which may not be numbered
Heb  To the great meeting and church of the first of those who are named in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of good men made complete
Heb  And to Jesus by whom the new agreement has been made between God and man and to the sign of the blood which says better things than Abels blood
Heb  See that you give ear to his voice which comes to you For if those whose ears were shut to the voice which came to them on earth did not go free from punishment what chance have we of going free if we give no attention to him whose voice comes from heaven
Heb  Whose voice was the cause of the shaking of the earth but now he has made an oath saying There will be still one more shaking not only of the earth but of heaven
Heb  And the words Still one more make it clear that there will be a taking away of those things which are shaking as of things which are made so that there may be only those things of which no shaking is possible
Heb  If then we have a kingdom which will never be moved let us have grace so that we may give God such worship as is pleasing to him with fear and respect
Heb  For our God is an allburning fire
Heb  Go on loving your brothers in the faith
Heb  Take care to keep open house because in this way some have had angels as their guests without being conscious of it
Heb  Keep in mind those who are in chains as if you were chained with them and those who are in trouble as being yourselves in the body
Heb  Let married life be honoured among all of you and not made unclean for men untrue in married life will be judged by God
Heb  Be free from the love of money and pleased with the things which you have for he himself has said I will be with you at all times
Heb  So that we say with a good heart The Lord is my helper I will have no fear what is man able to do to me
Heb  Keep in mind those who were over you and who gave you the word of God seeing the outcome of their way of life let your faith be like theirs
Heb  Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and for ever
Heb  Do not be turned away by different strange teachings because it is good for your hearts to be made strong by grace and not by meats which were of no profit to those who took so much trouble over them
Heb  We have an altar from which those priests who are servants in the Tent may not take food
Heb  For the bodies of the beasts whose blood is taken into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin are burned outside the circle of the tents
Heb  For this reason Jesus was put to death outside the walls so that he might make the people holy by his blood
Heb  Let us then go out to him outside the circle of the tents taking his shame on ourselves
Heb  For here we have no fixed restingplace but our search is for the one which is to come
Heb  Let us then make offerings of praise to God at all times through him that is to say the fruit of lips giving witness to his name
Heb  But go on doing good and giving to others because God is wellpleased with such offerings
Heb  Give ear to those who are rulers over you and do as they say for they keep watch over your souls ready to give an account of them let them be able to do this with joy and not with grief because that would be of no profit to you
Heb  Make prayers for us for we are certain that our hearts are free from the sense of sin desiring the right way of life in all things
Heb  I make this request more strongly in the hope of coming back to you more quickly
Heb  Now may the God of peace who made that great keeper of his flock even our Lord Jesus come back from the dead through the blood of the eternal agreement
Heb  Make you full of every good work and ready to do all his desires working in us whatever is pleasing in his eyes through Jesus Christ and may the glory be given to him for ever and ever So be it
Heb  But brothers take kindly the words which I have said for your profit for I have not sent you a long letter
Heb  Our brother Timothy has been let out of prison and if he comes here in a short time he and I will come to you together
Heb  Give words of love from me to those who are rulers over you and to all the saints Those who are in Italy send you their love
Heb  May grace be with you all
Jas  James a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ sends words of love to the twelve tribes of the Jews living in all parts of the earth
Jas  Let it be all joy to you my brothers when you undergo tests of every sort
Jas  Because you have the knowledge that the testing of your faith gives you the power of going on in hope
Jas  But let this power have its full effect so that you may be made complete needing nothing
Jas  But if any man among you is without wisdom let him make his request to God who gives freely to all without an unkind word and it will be given to him
Jas  Let him make his request in faith doubting nothing for he who has doubt in his heart is like the waves of the sea which are troubled by the driving of the wind
Jas  Let it not seem to such a man that he will get anything from the Lord
Jas  For there is a division in his mind and he is uncertain in all his ways
Jas  But let the brother of low position be glad that he is lifted up
Jas  But the man of wealth that he is made low because like the flower of the grass he will come to his end
Jas  For when the sun comes up with its burning heat the grass gets dry and the grace of its form is gone with the falling flower so the man of wealth comes to nothing in his ways
Jas  There is a blessing on the man who undergoes testing because if he has Gods approval he will be given the crown of life which the Lord has said he will give to those who have love for him
Jas  Let no man say when he is tested I am tested by God for it is not possible for God to be tested by evil and he himself puts no man to such a test
Jas  But every man is tested when he is turned out of the right way by the attraction of his desire
Jas  Then when its time comes desire gives birth to sin and sin when it is of full growth gives birth to death
Jas  Do not be turned from the right way dear brothers
Jas  Every good and true thing is given to us from heaven coming from the Father of lights with whom there is no change or any shade made by turning
Jas  Of his purpose he gave us being by his true word so that we might be in a sense the firstfruits of all the things which he had made
Jas  You have knowledge of this dear brothers But let every man be quick in hearing slow in words slow to get angry
Jas  For the righteousness of God does not come about by the wrath of man
Jas  For this reason putting away all dirty behaviour and the overweight of evil take into your souls without pride the word which being planted there is able to give you salvation
Jas  But be doers of the word and not only hearers of it blinding yourselves with false ideas
Jas  Because if any man is a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like a man looking at his natural face in a glass
Jas  For after looking at himself he goes away and in a short time he has no memory of what he was like
Jas  But he who goes on looking into the true law which makes him free being not a hearer without memory but a doer putting it into effect this man will have a blessing on his acts
Jas  If a man seems to have religion and has no control over his tongue but lets himself be tricked by what is false this mans religion is of no value
Jas  The religion which is holy and free from evil in the eyes of our God and Father is this to take care of children who have no fathers and of widows who are in trouble and to keep oneself untouched by the world
Jas  My brothers if you have the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory do not take a mans position into account
Jas  For if a man comes into your Synagogue in fair clothing and with a gold ring and a poor man comes in with dirty clothing
Jas  And you do honour to the man in fair clothing and say Come here and take this good place and you say to the poor man Take up your position there or be seated at my feet
Jas  Is there not a division in your minds have you not become judges with evil thoughts
Jas  Give ear my dear brothers are not those who are poor in the things of this world marked out by God to have faith as their wealth and for their heritage the kingdom which he has said he will give to those who have love for him
Jas  But you have put the poor man to shame Are not the men of wealth rulers over you do they not take you by force before their judges
Jas  Do they not say evil of the holy name which was given to you
Jas  But if you keep the greatest law of all as it is given in the holy Writings Have love for your neighbour as for yourself you do well
Jas  But if you take a mans position into account you do evil and are judged as evildoers by the law
Jas  For anyone who keeps all the law but makes a slip in one point is judged to have gone against it all
Jas  For he who said Do not be untrue in married life is the same who said Put no man to death Now if you are not untrue in married life but you put a man to death the law is broken
Jas  Let your words and your acts be those of men who are to be judged by the law which makes free
Jas  For the man who has had no mercy will be judged without mercy but mercy takes pride in overcoming judging
Jas  What use is it my brothers for a man to say that he has faith if he does nothing will such a faith give him salvation
Jas  If a brother or a sister is without clothing and in need of the days food
Jas  And one of you says to them Go in peace be warm and full of food but you do not give them the things of which their bodies have need what profit is there in this
Jas  Even so faith without works is dead
Jas  But a man may say You have faith and I have works let me see your faith without your works and I will make my faith clear to you by my works
Jas  You have the belief that God is one and you do well the evil spirits have the same belief shaking with fear
Jas  Do you not see O foolish man that faith without works is of no use
Jas  Was not the righteousness of Abraham our father judged by his works when he made an offering of Isaac his son on the altar
Jas  You see that his faith was helping his works and was made complete by them
Jas  And the holy Writings were put into effect which said And Abraham had faith in God and it was put to his account as righteousness and he was named the friend of God
Jas  You see that a mans righteousness is judged by his works and not by his faith only
Jas  And in the same way was not the righteousness of Rahab the loose woman judged by her works when she took into her house those who were sent and let them go out by another way
Jas  For as the body without the spirit is dead even so faith without works is dead
Jas  Do not all be teachers my brothers because we teachers will be judged more hardly than others
Jas  For we all go wrong in a number of things If a man never makes a slip in his talk then he is a complete man and able to keep all his body in control
Jas  Now if we put bits of iron into horses mouths so that they may be guided by us we have complete control of their bodies
Jas  And again ships though they are so great and are moved by violent winds are turned by a very small guidingblade at the impulse of the man who is using it
Jas  Even so the tongue is a small part of the body but it takes credit for great things How much wood may be lighted by a very little fire
Jas  And the tongue is a fire it is the power of evil placed in our bodies making all the body unclean putting the wheel of life on fire and getting its fire from hell
Jas  For every sort of beast and bird and every living thing on earth and in the sea has been controlled by man and is under his authority
Jas  But the tongue may not be controlled by man it is an unresting evil it is full of the poison of death
Jas  With it we give praise to our Lord and Father and with it we put a curse on men who are made in Gods image
Jas  Out of the same mouth comes blessing and cursing My brothers it is not right for these things to be so
Jas  Does the fountain send from the same outlet sweet and bitter water
Jas  Is a figtree able to give us olives my brothers or do we get figs from a vine or sweet water from the salt sea
Jas  Who has wisdom and good sense among you let him make his works clear by a life of gentle wisdom
Jas  But if you have bitter envy in your heart and the desire to get the better of others have no pride in this talking falsely against what is true
Jas  This wisdom is not from heaven but is of the earth and the flesh and the Evil One
Jas  For where envy is and the desire to get the better of others there is no order but every sort of evildoing
Jas  But the wisdom which is from heaven is first holy then gentle readily giving way in argument full of peace and mercy and good works not doubting not seeming other than it is
Jas  And the fruit of righteousness is planted in peace for those who make peace
Jas  What is the cause of wars and fighting among you is it not in your desires which are at war in your bodies
Jas  You are burning with desire and have not your desire so you put men to death you are full of envy and you are not able to get your desire so you are fighting and making war you have not your desire because you do not make request for it
Jas  You make your request but you do not get it because your request has been wrongly made desiring the thing only so that you may make use of it for your pleasure
Jas  O you who are false to God do you not see that the friends of this world are not Gods friends Every man desiring to be a friend of this world makes himself a hater of God
Jas  Or does it seem to you that it is for nothing that the holy Writings say The spirit which God put into our hearts has a strong desire for us
Jas  But he gives more grace So that the Writings say God is against the men of pride but he gives grace to those who make themselves low before him
Jas  For this cause be ruled by God but make war on the Evil One and he will be put to flight before you
Jas  Come near to God and he will come near to you Make your hands clean you evildoers put away deceit from your hearts you false in mind
Jas  Be troubled with sorrow and weeping let your laughing be turned to sorrow and your joy to grief
Jas  Make yourselves low in the eyes of the Lord and you will be lifted up by him
Jas  Do not say evil against one another my brothers He who says evil against his brother or makes himself his brothers judge says evil against the law and is judging the law and in judging the law you become not a doer of the law but a judge
Jas  There is only one judge and lawgiver even he who has the power of salvation and of destruction but who are you to be your neighbours judge
Jas  How foolish it is to say Today or tomorrow we will go into this town and be there for a year and do business there and get wealth
Jas  When you are not certain what will take place tomorrow What is your life It is a mist which is seen for a little time and then is gone
Jas  But the right thing to say would be If it is the Lords pleasure and if we are still living we will do this and that
Jas  But now you go on glorying in your pride and all such glorying is evil
Jas  The man who has knowledge of how to do good and does not do it to him it is sin
Jas  Come now you men of wealth give yourselves to weeping and crying because of the bitter troubles which are coming to you
Jas  Your wealth is unclean and insects have made holes in your clothing
Jas  Your gold and your silver are wasted and their waste will be a witness against you burning into your flesh You have put by your store in the last days
Jas  See the money which you falsely kept back from the workers cutting the grass in your field is crying out against you and the cries of those who took in your grain have come to the ears of the Lord of armies
Jas  You have been living delicately on earth and have taken your pleasure you have made your hearts fat for a day of destruction
Jas  You have given your decision against the upright man and have put him to death He puts up no fight against you
Jas  Go on waiting calmly my brothers till the coming of the Lord like the farmer waiting for the good fruit of the earth till the early and late rains have come
Jas  Be as calm in your waiting let your hearts be strong because the coming of the Lord is near
Jas  Say no hard things against one another brothers so that you will not be judged see the judge is waiting at the doors
Jas  Take as an example of pain nobly undergone and of strength in trouble the prophets who gave to men the words of the Lord
Jas  We say that those men who have gone through pain are happy you have the story of Job and the troubles through which he went and have seen that the Lord was full of pity and mercy in the end
Jas  But most of all my brothers do not take oaths not by the heaven or by the earth or by any other thing but let your Yes be Yes and your No be No so that you may not be judged
Jas  Is anyone among you in trouble let him say prayers Is anyone glad let him make a song of praise
Jas  Is anyone among you ill let him send for the rulers of the church and let them say prayers over him putting oil on him in the name of the Lord
Jas  And by the prayer of faith the man who is ill will be made well and he will be lifted up by the Lord and for any sin which he has done he will have forgiveness
Jas  So then make a statement of your sins to one another and say prayers for one another so that you may be made well The prayer of a good man is full of power in its working
Jas  Elijah was a man of flesh and blood as we are and he made a strong prayer that there might be no rain and there was no rain on the earth for three years and six months
Jas  And he made another prayer and the heaven sent down rain and the earth gave her fruit
Jas  My brothers if one of you has gone out of the way of the true faith and another has made him see his error
Jas  Be certain that he through whom a sinner has been turned from the error of his way keeps a soul from death and is the cause of forgiveness for sins without number
Pe  Peter an Apostle of Jesus Christ to the saints who are living in Pontus Galatia Cappadocia Asia and Bithynia
Pe  Who through the purpose of God have been made holy by the Spirit disciples of Jesus made clean by his blood May you have grace and peace in full measure
Pe  Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who through his great mercy has given us a new birth and a living hope by the coming again of Jesus Christ from the dead
Pe  And a heritage fair holy and for ever new waiting in heaven for you
Pe  Who by the power of God are kept through faith for that salvation which will be seen at the last day
Pe  You have cause for great joy in this though it may have been necessary for you to be troubled for a little time being tested in all sorts of ways
Pe  So that the true metal of your faith being of much greater value than gold which though it comes to an end is tested by fire may come to light in praise and glory and honour at the revelation of Jesus Christ
Pe  To whom your love is given though you have not seen him and the faith which you have in him though you do not see him now gives you joy greater than words and full of glory
Pe  For so you have the true end of your faith even the salvation of your souls
Pe  For the prophets who gave the news of the grace which would come to you made search with all care for knowledge of this salvation
Pe  Attempting to see what sort of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them was pointing to when it gave witness to the pains which Christ would undergo and the glories which would come after them
Pe  And it was made clear to those prophets that they were Gods servants not for themselves but for you to give you word of the things which have now come to your ears from the preachers of the good news through the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven things which even angels have a desire to see
Pe  So make your minds ready and keep on the watch hoping with all your power for the grace which is to come to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ
Pe  Like children ruled by God do not go back to the old desires of the time when you were without knowledge
Pe  But be holy in every detail of your lives as he whose servants you are is holy
Pe  Because it has been said in the Writings You are to be holy for I am holy
Pe  And if you give the name of Father to him who judging every man by his acts has no respect for a mans position then go in fear while you are on this earth
Pe  Being conscious that you have been made free from that foolish way of life which was your heritage from your fathers not through a payment of things like silver or gold which come to destruction
Pe  But through holy blood like that of a clean and unmarked lamb even the blood of Christ
Pe  Who was marked out by God before the making of the world but was caused to be seen in these last times for you
Pe  Who through him have faith in God who took him up again from the dead into glory so that your faith and hope might be in God
Pe  And as you have made your souls clean being ruled by what is true and loving one another without deceit see that your love is warm and from the heart
Pe  Because you have had a new birth not from the seed of man but from eternal seed through the word of a living and unchanging God
Pe  For it is said All flesh is like grass and all its glory like the flower of the grass The grass becomes dry and the flower dead
Pe  But the word of the Lord is eternal And this is the word of the good news which was given to you
Pe  So putting away all wrongdoing and all tricks and deceits and envies and evil talk
Pe  Be full of desire for the true milk of the word as babies at their mothers breasts so that you may go on to salvation
Pe  If you have had a taste of the grace of the Lord
Pe  To whom you come as to a living stone not honoured by men but of great and special value to God
Pe  You as living stones are being made into a house of the spirit a holy order of priests making those offerings of the spirit which are pleasing to God through Jesus Christ
Pe  Because it is said in the Writings See I am placing a keystone in Zion of great and special value and the man who has faith in him will not be put to shame
Pe  And the value is for you who have faith but it is said for those without faith The very stone which the builders put on one side was made the chief stone of the building
Pe  And A stone of falling a rock of trouble the word is the cause of their fall because they go against it and this was the purpose of God
Pe  But you are a special people a holy nation priests and kings a people given up completely to God so that you may make clear the virtues of him who took you out of the dark into the light of heaven
Pe  In the past you were not a people but now you are the people of God then there was no mercy for you but now mercy has been given to you
Pe  My loved ones I make this request with all my heart that as those for whom this world is a strange country you will keep yourselves from the desires of the flesh which make war against the soul
Pe  Being of good behaviour among the Gentiles so that though they say now that you are evildoers they may see your good works and give glory to God when he comes to be their judge
Pe  Keep all the laws of men because of the Lord those of the king who is over all
Pe  And those of the rulers who are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of those who do well
Pe  Because it is Gods pleasure that foolish and narrowminded men may be put to shame by your good behaviour
Pe  As those who are free not using your free position as a cover for wrongdoing but living as the servants of God
Pe  Have respect for all loving the brothers fearing God honouring the king
Pe  Servants take orders from your masters with all respect not only if they are good and gentle but even if they are badhumoured
Pe  For it is a sign of grace if a man desiring to do right in the eyes of God undergoes pain as punishment for something which he has not done
Pe  What credit is it if when you have done evil you take your punishment quietly but if you are given punishment for doing right and take it quietly this is pleasing to God
Pe  This is Gods purpose for you because Jesus himself underwent punishment for you giving you an example so that you might go in his footsteps
Pe  Who did no evil and there was no deceit in his mouth
Pe  To sharp words he gave no sharp answer when he was undergoing pain no angry word came from his lips but he put himself into the hands of the judge of righteousness
Pe  He took our sins on himself giving his body to be nailed on the tree so that we being dead to sin might have a new life in righteousness and by his wounds we have been made well
Pe  Because like sheep you had gone out of the way but now you have come back to him who keeps watch over your souls
Pe  Wives be ruled by your husbands so that even if some of them give no attention to the word their hearts may be changed by the behaviour of their wives
Pe  When they see your holy behaviour in the fear of God
Pe  Do not let your ornaments be those of the body such as dressing of the hair or putting on of jewels of gold or fair clothing
Pe  But let them be those of the unseen man of the heart the evershining ornament of a gentle and quiet spirit which is of great price in the eyes of God
Pe  And these were the ornaments of the holy women of the past whose hope was in God being ruled by their husbands
Pe  As Sarah was ruled by Abraham naming him lord whose children you are if you do well and are not put in fear by any danger
Pe  And you husbands give thought to your way of life with your wives giving honour to the woman who is the feebler vessel but who has an equal part in the heritage of the grace of life so that you may not be kept from prayer
Pe  Last of all see that you are all in agreement feeling for one another loving one another like brothers full of pity without pride
Pe  Not giving back evil for evil or curse for curse but in place of cursing blessing because this is the purpose of God for you that you may have a heritage of blessing
Pe  For it is said Let the man who has a love of life desiring to see good days keep his tongue from evil and his lips from words of deceit
Pe  And let him be turned from evil and do good searching for peace and going after it with all his heart
Pe  For the eyes of the Lord are on the upright and his ears are open to their prayers but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil
Pe  Who will do you any damage if you keep your minds fixed on what is good
Pe  But you are happy if you undergo pain because of righteousness have no part in their fear and do not be troubled
Pe  But give honour to Christ in your hearts as your Lord and be ready at any time when you are questioned about the hope which is in you to give an answer in the fear of the Lord and without pride
Pe  Being conscious that you have done no wrong so that those who say evil things about your good way of life as Christians may be put to shame
Pe  Because if it is Gods purpose for you to undergo pain it is better to do so for welldoing than for evildoing
Pe  Because Christ once went through pain for sins the upright one taking the place of sinners so that through him we might come back to God being put to death in the flesh but given life in the Spirit
Pe  By whom he went to the spirits in prison preaching to those
Pe  Who in the days of Noah went against Gods orders but God in his mercy kept back the punishment while Noah got ready the ark in which a small number that is to say eight persons got salvation through water
Pe  And baptism of which this is an image now gives you salvation not by washing clean the flesh but by making you free from the sense of sin before God through the coming again of Jesus Christ from the dead
Pe  Who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God angels and authorities and powers having been put under his rule
Pe  So that as Jesus was put to death in the flesh do you yourselves be of the same mind for the death of the flesh puts an end to sin
Pe  So that you may give the rest of your lives in the flesh not to the desires of men but to the purpose of God
Pe  Because for long enough in times past we have been living after the way of the Gentiles given up to the desires of the flesh to drinking and feasting and loose behaviour and unclean worship of images
Pe  And they are wondering that you no longer go with them in this violent wasting of life and are saying evil things of you
Pe  But they will have to give an account of themselves to him who is ready to be the judge of the living and the dead
Pe  For this was the reason why the good news of Jesus was given even to the dead so that they might be judged as men in the flesh but might be living before God in the spirit
Pe  But the end of all things is near so be serious in your behaviour and keep on the watch with prayer
Pe  And most of all be warm in your love for one another because in love there is forgiveness for sins without number
Pe  Keep open house for all with a glad heart
Pe  Making distribution among one another of whatever has been given to you like true servants of the unmeasured grace of God
Pe  If anyone has anything to say let it be as the words of God if anyone has the desire to be the servant of others let him do it in the strength which is given by God so that in all things God may have the glory through Jesus Christ whose are the glory and the power for ever
Pe  Dear brothers do not be surprised as if it was something strange if your faith is tested as by fire
Pe  But be glad that you are given a part in the pains of Christ so that at the revelation of his glory you may have great joy
Pe  If men say evil things of you because of the name of Christ happy are you for the Spirit of glory and of God is resting on you
Pe  Let no one among you undergo punishment as a taker of life or as a thief or as an evildoer or as one who is overinterested in other mens business
Pe  But if he undergoes punishment as a Christian that is no shame to him let him give glory to God in this name
Pe  For the time has come for the judging starting with the church of God but if it makes a start with us what will be the end of those who are not under the rule of God
Pe  And if it is hard for even the good man to get salvation what chance has the man without religion or the sinner
Pe  For this reason let those who by the purpose of God undergo punishment keep on in welldoing and put their souls into the safe hands of their Maker
Pe  I who am myself one of the rulers of the church and a witness of the death of Christ having my part in the coming glory send this serious request to the chief men among you
Pe  Keep watch over the flock of God which is in your care using your authority not as forced to do so but gladly and not for unclean profit but with a ready mind
Pe  Not as lords over Gods heritage but making yourselves examples to the flock
Pe  And at the coming of the chief Keeper of the sheep you will be given the eternal crown of glory
Pe  And in the same way let the younger men be ruled by the older ones Let all of you put away pride and make yourselves ready to be servants for God is a hater of pride but he gives grace to those who make themselves low
Pe  For this cause make yourselves low under the strong hand of God so that when the time comes you may be lifted up
Pe  Putting all your troubles on him for he takes care of you
Pe  Be serious and keep watch the Evil One who is against you goes about like a lion with open mouth in search of food
Pe  Do not give way to him but be strong in your faith in the knowledge that your brothers who are in the world undergo the same troubles
Pe  And after you have undergone pain for a little time the God of all grace who has given you a part in his eternal glory through Christ Jesus will himself give you strength and support and make you complete in every good thing
Pe  His is the power for ever So be it
Pe  I have sent you this short letter by Silvanus a true brother in my opinion comforting you and witnessing that this is the true grace of God keep to it
Pe  She who is in Babylon who has a part with you in the purpose of God sends you her love and so does my son Mark
Pe  Give one another the kiss of love Peace be to you all in Christ
Pe  Simon Peter a servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to those who with us have a part in the same holy faith in the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ
Pe  May grace and peace ever be increasing in you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord
Pe  Because by his power he has given us everything necessary for life and righteousness through the knowledge of him who has been our guide by his glory and virtue
Pe  And through this he has given us the hope of great rewards highly to be valued so that by them we might have our part in Gods being and be made free from the destruction which is in the world through the desires of the flesh
Pe  So for this very cause take every care joining virtue to faith and knowledge to virtue
Pe  And selfcontrol to knowledge and a quiet mind to selfcontrol and fear of God to a quiet mind
Pe  And love of the brothers to fear of God and to love of the brothers love itself
Pe  For if you have these things in good measure they will make you fertile and full of fruit in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ
Pe  For the man who has not these things is blind seeing only what is near having no memory of how he was made clean from his old sins
Pe  For this reason my brothers take all the more care to make your selection and approval certain for if you do these things you will never have a fall
Pe  For so the way will be open to you into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ
Pe  For this reason I will be ready at all times to keep your memory of these things awake though you have the knowledge of them now and are well based in your present faith
Pe  And it seems right to me as long as I am in this tent of flesh to keep your minds awake by working on your memory
Pe  For I am conscious that in a short time I will have to put off this tent of flesh as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me
Pe  And I will take every care so that you may have a clear memory of these things after my death
Pe  For when we gave you news of the power and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ our teaching was not based on stories put together by art but we were eyewitnesses of his glory
Pe  For God the Father gave him honour and glory when such a voice came to him out of the great glory saying This is my dearly loved Son with whom I am well pleased
Pe  And this voice came from heaven even to our ears when we were with him on the holy mountain
Pe  And so the words of the prophets are made more certain and it is well for you to give attention to them as to a light shining in a dark place till the dawn comes and the morning star is seen in your hearts
Pe  Being conscious in the first place that no man by himself may give a special sense to the words of the prophets
Pe  For these words did not ever come through the impulse of men but the prophets had them from God being moved by the Holy Spirit
Pe  But there were false prophets among the people as there will be false teachers among you who will secretly put forward wrong teachings for your destruction even turning away from the Lord who gave himself for them whose destruction will come quickly and they themselves will be the cause of it
Pe  And a great number will go with them in their evil ways through whom the true way will have a bad name
Pe  And in their desire for profit they will come to you with words of deceit like traders doing business in souls whose punishment has been ready for a long time and their destruction is watching for them
Pe  For if God did not have pity for the angels who did evil but sent them down into hell to be kept in chains of eternal night till they were judged
Pe  And did not have mercy on the world which then was but only kept safe Noah a preacher of righteousness with seven others when he let loose the waters over the world of the evildoers
Pe  And sent destruction on Sodom and Gomorrah burning them up with fire as an example to those whose way of life might in the future be unpleasing to him
Pe  And kept safe Lot the upright man who was deeply troubled by the unclean life of the evildoers
Pe  Because the soul of that upright man living among them was pained from day to day by seeing and hearing their crimes
Pe  The Lord is able to keep the upright safe in the time of testing and to keep evildoers under punishment till the day of judging
Pe  But specially those who go after the unclean desires of the flesh and make sport of authority Ready to take chances uncontrolled they have no fear of saying evil of those in high places
Pe  Though the angels who are greater in strength and power do not make use of violent language against them before the Lord
Pe  But these men like beasts without reason whose natural use is to be taken and put to death crying out against things of which they have no knowledge will undergo that same destruction which they are designing for others
Pe  For the evil which overtakes them is the reward of their evildoing such men take their pleasure in the delights of the flesh even in the daytime they are like the marks of a disease like poisoned wounds among you feasting together with you in joy
Pe  Having eyes full of evil desire never having enough of sin turning feeble souls out of the true way they are children of cursing whose hearts are well used to bitter envy
Pe  Turning out of the true way they have gone wandering in error after the way of Balaam the son of Beor who was pleased to take payment for wrongdoing
Pe  But his wrongdoing was pointed out to him an ass talking with a mans voice put a stop to the error of the prophet
Pe  These are fountains without water and mists before a driving storm for whom the eternal night is kept in store
Pe  For with highsounding false words making use of the attraction of unclean desires of the flesh they get into their power those newly made free from those who are living in error
Pe  Saying that they will be free while they themselves are the servants of destruction because whatever gets the better of a man makes a servant of him
Pe  For if after they have got free from the unclean things of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ they are again taken in the net and overcome their last condition is worse than their first
Pe  For it would have been better for them to have had no knowledge of the way of righteousness than to go back again from the holy law which was given to them after having knowledge of it
Pe  They are an example of that true saying The dog has gone back to the food it had put out and the pig which had been washed to its rolling in the dirty earth
Pe  My loved ones this is now my second letter to you and in this as in the first I am attempting to keep your true minds awake
Pe  So that you may keep in mind the words of the holy prophets in the past and the law of the Lord and Saviour which was given to you by his Apostles
Pe  Having first of all the knowledge that in the last days there will be men who ruled by their evil desires will make sport of holy things
Pe  Saying Where is the hope of his coming From the death of the fathers till now everything has gone on as it was from the making of the world
Pe  But in taking this view they put out of their minds the memory that in the old days there was a heaven and an earth lifted out of the water and circled by water by the word of God
Pe  And that the world which then was came to an end through the overflowing of the waters
Pe  But the present heaven and the present earth have been kept for destruction by fire which is waiting for them on the day of the judging and destruction of evil men
Pe  But my loved ones keep in mind this one thing that with the Lord one day is the same as a thousand years and a thousand years are no more than one day
Pe  The Lord is not slow in keeping his word as he seems to some but he is waiting in mercy for you not desiring the destruction of any but that all may be turned from their evil ways
Pe  But the day of the Lord will come like a thief and in that day the heavens will be rolled up with a great noise and the substance of the earth will be changed by violent heat and the world and everything in it will be burned up
Pe  Seeing then that all these things are coming to such an end what sort of persons is it right for you to be in all holy behaviour and righteousness
Pe  Looking for and truly desiring the coming of the day of God when the heavens will come to an end through fire and the substance of the earth will be changed by the great heat
Pe  But having faith in his word we are looking for a new heaven and a new earth which will be the restingplace of righteousness
Pe  For this reason my loved ones as you are looking for these things take great care that when he comes you may be in peace before him free from sin and every evil thing
Pe  And be certain that the long waiting of the Lord is for salvation even as our brother Paul has said in his letters to you from the wisdom which was given to him
Pe  And as he said in all his letters which had to do with these things in which are some hard sayings so that like the rest of the holy Writings they are twisted by those who are uncertain and without knowledge to the destruction of their souls
Pe  For this reason my loved ones having knowledge of these things before they take place take care that you are not turned away by the error of the uncontrolled so falling from your true faith
Pe  But be increased in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ May he have glory now and for ever So be it
Jn  That which was from the first which has come to our ears and which we have seen with our eyes looking on it and touching it with our hands about the Word of life
Jn  And the life was made clear to us and we have seen it and are witnessing to it and giving you word of that eternal life which was with the Father and was seen by us
Jn  We give you word of all we have seen and everything which has come to our ears so that you may be united with us and we are united with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ
Jn  And we are writing these things to you so that our joy may be made complete
Jn  This is the word which came to us from him and which we give to you that God is light and in him there is nothing dark
Jn  If we say we are joined to him and are walking still in the dark our words are false and our acts are untrue
Jn  But if we are walking in the light as he is in the light we are all united with one another and the blood of Jesus his Son makes us clean from all sin
Jn  If we say that we have no sin we are false to ourselves and there is nothing true in us
Jn  If we say openly that we have done wrong he is upright and true to his word giving us forgiveness of sins and making us clean from all evil
Jn  If we say that we have no sin we make him false and his word is not in us
Jn  My little children I am writing these things to you so that you may be without sin And if any man is a sinner we have a friend and helper with the Father Jesus Christ the upright one
Jn  He is the offering for our sins and not for ours only but for all the world
Jn  And by this we may be certain that we have knowledge of him if we keep his laws
Jn  The man who says I have knowledge of him and does not keep his laws is false and there is nothing true in him
Jn  But in every man who keeps his word the love of God is made complete By this we may be certain that we are in him
Jn  He who says that he is living in him will do as he did
Jn  My loved ones I do not give you a new law but an old law which you had from the first this old law is the word which came to your ears
Jn  Again I give you a new law which is true in him and in you for the night is near its end and the true light is even now shining out
Jn  He who says that he is in the light and has hate in his heart for his brother is still in the dark
Jn  He who has love for his brother is in the light and there is no cause of error in him
Jn  But he who has hate for his brother is in the dark walking in the dark with no knowledge of where he is going unable to see because of the dark
Jn  I am writing to you my children because you have forgiveness of sins through his name
Jn  I am writing to you fathers because you have knowledge of him who was from the first I am writing to you young men because you have overcome the Evil One I have sent a letter to you children because you have knowledge of the Father
Jn  I have sent a letter to you fathers because you have knowledge of him who was from the first I have sent a letter to you young men because you are strong and the word of God is in you and because you have overcome the Evil One
Jn  Have no love for the world or for the things which are in the world If any man has love for the world the love of the Father is not in him
Jn  Because everything in the world the desire of the flesh the desire of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the Father but of the world
Jn  And the world and its desires is coming to an end but he who does Gods pleasure is living for ever
Jn  Little children it is the last hour and as you were given word that the Antichrist would come so now a number of Antichrists have come to you and by this we are certain that it is the last hour
Jn  They went out from us but they were not of us if they had been of us they would still be with us but they went out from us so that it might be made clear that they were not of us
Jn  And you have the Spirit from the Holy One and you all have knowledge
Jn  I have not sent you this letter because you have no knowledge of what is true but because you have knowledge and because that which is false has nothing in common with that which is true
Jn  Who is false but he who says that Jesus is not the Christ He is the Antichrist who has no belief in the Father or the Son
Jn  He who has no belief in the Son has not the Father he who makes clear his belief in the Son has the Father
Jn  But as for you keep in your hearts the things which were made clear to you from the first If you keep these things in your hearts you will be kept in the Father and the Son
Jn  And this is the hope which he gave you even eternal life
Jn  I am writing these things to you about those whose purpose is that you may be turned out of the true way
Jn  As for you the Spirit which he gave you is still in you and you have no need of any teacher but as his Spirit gives you teaching about all things and is true and not false so keep your hearts in him through the teaching which he has given you
Jn  And now my children keep your hearts in him so that at his revelation we may have no fear or shame before him at his coming
Jn  If you have knowledge that he is upright it is clear to you that everyone who does righteousness is his offspring
Jn  See what great love the Father has given us in naming us the children of God and such we are For this reason the world does not see who we are because it did not see who he was
Jn  My loved ones now we are children of God and at present it is not clear what we are to be We are certain that at his revelation we will be like him for we will see him as he is
Jn  And everyone who has this hope in him makes himself holy even as he is holy
Jn  Everyone who is a sinner goes against the law for sin is going against the law
Jn  And you have knowledge that he came to take away sin and in him there is no sin
Jn  Anyone who is in him does no sin anyone who is a sinner has not seen him and has no knowledge of him
Jn  My little children let no man take you out of the true way he who does righteousness is upright even as he is upright
Jn  The sinner is a child of the Evil One for the Evil One has been a sinner from the first And the Son of God was seen on earth so that he might put an end to the works of the Evil One
Jn  Anyone who is a child of God does no sin because he still has Gods seed in him he is not able to be a sinner because God is his Father
Jn  In this way it is clear who are the children of God and who are the children of the Evil One anyone who does not do righteousness or who has no love for his brother is not a child of God
Jn  Because this is the word which was given to you from the first that we are to have love for one another
Jn  Not being of the Evil One like Cain who put his brother to death And why did he put him to death Because his works were evil and his brothers works were good
Jn  Do not be surprised my brothers if the world has no love for you
Jn  We are conscious that we have come out of death into life because of our love for the brothers He who has no love is still in death
Jn  Anyone who has hate for his brother is a taker of life and you may be certain that no taker of life has eternal life in him
Jn  In this we see what love is because he gave his life for us and it is right for us to give our lives for the brothers
Jn  But if a man has this worlds goods and sees that his brother is in need and keeps his heart shut against his brother how is it possible for the love of God to be in him
Jn  My little children do not let our love be in word and in tongue but let it be in act and in good faith
Jn  In this way we may be certain that we are true and may give our heart comfort before him
Jn  When our heart says that we have done wrong because God is greater than our heart and has knowledge of all things
Jn  My loved ones if our heart does not say that we have done wrong we have no fear before him
Jn  And he gives us all our requests because we keep his laws and do the things which are pleasing in his eyes
Jn  And this is his law that we have faith in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love for one another even as he said to us
Jn  He who keeps his laws is in God and God is in him And the Spirit which he gave us is our witness that he is in us
Jn  My loved ones do not put your faith in every spirit but put them to the test to see if they are from God because a great number of false prophets have gone out into the world
Jn  By this you may have knowledge of the Spirit of God every spirit which says that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God
Jn  And every spirit which does not say this is not from God this is the spirit of Antichrist of which you have had word and it is in the world even now
Jn  You are of God my little children and you have overcome them because he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world
Jn  They are of the world so their talk is the worlds talk and the world gives ear to them
Jn  We are of God he who has the knowledge of God gives ear to us he who is not of God does not give ear to us By this we may see which is the true spirit and which is the spirit of error
Jn  My loved ones let us have love for one another because love is of God and everyone who has love is a child of God and has knowledge of God
Jn  He who has no love has no knowledge of God because God is love
Jn  And the love of God was made clear to us when he sent his only Son into the world so that we might have life through him
Jn  And this is love not that we had love for God but that he had love for us and sent his Son to be an offering for our sins
Jn  My loved ones if God had such love for us it is right for us to have love for one another
Jn  No man has ever seen God if we have love for one another God is in us and his love is made complete in us
Jn  And his Spirit which he has given us is the witness that we are in him and he is in us
Jn  And we have seen and give witness that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world
Jn  Everyone who says openly that Jesus is the Son of God has God in him and is in God
Jn  And we have seen and had faith in the love which God has for us God is love and everyone who has love is in God and God is in him
Jn  In this way love is made complete in us so that we may be without fear on the day of judging because as he is so are we in this world
Jn  There is no fear in love true love has no room for fear because where fear is there is pain and he who is not free from fear is not complete in love
Jn  We have the power of loving because he first had love for us
Jn  If a man says I have love for God and has hate for his brother his words are false for how is the man who has no love for his brother whom he has seen able to have love for God whom he has not seen
Jn  And this is the word which we have from him that he who has love for God is to have the same love for his brother
Jn  Everyone who has faith that Jesus is the Christ is a child of God and everyone who has love for the Father has love for his child
Jn  In this way we are certain that we have love for the children of God when we have love for God and keep his laws
Jn  For loving God is keeping his laws and his laws are not hard
Jn  Anything which comes from God is able to overcome the world and the power by which we have overcome the world is our faith
Jn  Who is able to overcome the world but the man who has faith that Jesus is the Son of God
Jn  This is he who came by water and by blood Jesus Christ not by water only but by water and by blood
Jn  And the Spirit is the witness because the Spirit is true
Jn  There are three witnesses the Spirit the water and the blood and all three are in agreement
Jn  If we take the witness of men to be true the witness of God is greater because this is the witness which God has given about his Son
Jn  He who has faith in the Son of God has the witness in himself he who has not faith in God makes him false because he has not faith in the witness which God has given about his Son
Jn  And his witness is this that God has given us eternal life and this life is in his Son
Jn  He who has the Son has the life he who has not the Son of God has not the life
Jn  I have put these things in writing for you who have faith in the name of the Son of God so that you may be certain that you have eternal life
Jn  And we are certain that if we make any request to him which is right in his eyes he will give ear to us
Jn  And if we are certain that he gives ear to all our requests we are equally certain that we will get our requests
Jn  If a man sees his brother doing a sin which is not bad enough for death let him make a prayer to God and God will give life to him whose sin was not bad enough for death There is a sin whose punishment is death I do not say that he may make such a request then
Jn  All evildoing is sin but death is not the punishment for every sort of sin
Jn  We are certain that one who is a child of God will do no sin but the Son of God keeps him so that he is not touched by the Evil One
Jn  We are certain that we are of God but all the world is in the power of the Evil One
Jn  And we are certain that the Son of God has come and has given us a clear vision so that we may see him who is true and we are in him who is true in his Son Jesus Christ He is the true God and eternal life
Jn  My little children keep yourselves from false gods
Jn  I a ruler in the church send word to the noble sister who is of Gods selection and to her children for whom I have true love and not only I but all who have knowledge of what is true
Jn  Because of this true knowledge which is in us and will be with us for ever
Jn  May grace mercy and peace be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Son of the Father in all true love
Jn  It gave me great joy to see some of your children walking in the true way even as we were ordered to do by the Father
Jn  And now my sister I make a request to you not sending you a new law but the law which we had from the first that we have love for one another
Jn  And love is the keeping of his laws This is the law which was given to you from the first so that you might keep it
Jn  Because a number of false teachers have gone out into the world who do not give witness that Jesus Christ came in the flesh Such a one is a false teacher and Antichrist
Jn  Keep watch over yourselves so that you do not make our work of no effect but may get your full reward
Jn  Anyone who goes on and does not keep to the teaching of Christ has not God he who keeps to the teaching has the Father and the Son
Jn  If anyone comes to you not having this teaching do not take him into your house or give him words of love
Jn  For he who gives him words of love has a part in his evil works
Jn  Having much to say to you it is not my purpose to put it all down with paper and ink but I am hoping to come to you and to have talk with you face to face so that your joy may be full
Jn  The children of your noble sister who is of Gods selection send you their love
Jn  I a ruler in the church send word to the well loved Gaius for whom I have true love
Jn  My loved one it is my prayer that you may do well in all things and be healthy in body even as your soul does well
Jn  For it gave me great joy when some of the brothers came and gave witness that you had the true faith and were walking in the true way
Jn  I have no greater joy than to have news that my children are walking in the true way
Jn  My loved one you are doing a good work in being kind to those brothers who come from other places
Jn  Who have given witness to the church of your love for them and you will do well to send them on their way well cared for as is right for servants of God
Jn  For they went out for love of the Name taking nothing from the Gentiles
Jn  So it is right for us to take in such men as guests so that we may take our part in the work of the true faith
Jn  I sent a letter to the church but Diotrephes whose desire is ever to have the first place among them will not have us there
Jn  So if I come I will keep in mind the things he does talking against us with evil words and as if this was not enough he does not take the brothers into his house and those who are ready to take them in he keeps from doing so putting them out of the church if they do
Jn  My loved one do not be copying what is evil but what is good He who does good is of God he who does evil has not seen God
Jn  Demetrius has the approval of all men and of what is true and we give the same witness and you are certain that our witness is true
Jn  I had much to say to you but it is not my purpose to put it all down with ink and pen
Jn  But I am hoping to see you in a short time and to have talk with you face to face May you have peace Your friends here send you their love Give my love to our friends by name
Jud  Jude a servant of Jesus Christ and the brother of James to those of Gods selection who have been made holy by God the Father and are kept safe for Jesus Christ
Jud  May mercy and peace and love be increased in you
Jud  My loved ones while my thoughts were full of a letter which I was going to send you about our common salvation it was necessary for me to send you one requesting you with all my heart to go on fighting strongly for the faith which has been given to the saints once and for ever
Jud  For certain men have come among you secretly marked out before in the holy Writings for this evil fate men without the fear of God turning his grace into an unclean thing and false to our only Master and Lord Jesus Christ
Jud  Now it is my purpose to put you in mind though you once had knowledge of all these things of how the Lord having taken a people safely out of Egypt later sent destruction on those who had no faith
Jud  And the angels who did not keep to their kingdom but went out from the place which was theirs he has put in eternal chains and in dark night till the great day of the judging
Jud  Even as Sodom and Gomorrah and the towns near them having like these given themselves up to unclean desires and gone after strange flesh have been made an example undergoing the punishment of eternal fire
Jud  In the same way these dreamers make the flesh unclean having no respect for authorities and say evil of rulers
Jud  Now when Michael one of the chief angels was fighting against the Evil One for the body of Moses fearing to make use of violent words against him he only said May the Lord be your judge
Jud  But these men say evil about such things as they have no knowledge of and the things of which they have natural knowledge like beasts without reason are the cause of their destruction
Jud  A curse on them They have gone in the way of Cain running uncontrolled into the error of Balaam for reward and have come to destruction by saying evil against the Lord like Korah
Jud  These men are unseen rocks at your lovefeasts when they take part in them with you keepers of sheep who without fear take the food of the sheep clouds without water rushing before the wind wasted trees without fruit twice dead pulled up by the roots
Jud  Violent waves of the sea streaming with their shame wandering stars for whom the darkest night is kept in store for ever
Jud  The prophet Enoch who was the seventh after Adam said of these men The Lord came with tens of thousands of his saints
Jud  To be the judge of all and to give a decision against all those whose lives are unpleasing to him because of the evil acts which they have done and because of all the hard things which sinners without fear of God have said against him
Jud  These are the men who make trouble ever desiring change going after evil pleasures using highsounding words respecting mens position in the hope of reward
Jud  But you my loved ones keep in memory the words which were said before by the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ
Jud  How they said to you In the last days there will be men who guided by their evil desires will make sport of holy things
Jud  These are the men who make divisions natural men not having the Spirit
Jud  But you my loved ones building yourselves up on your most holy faith and making prayers in the Holy Spirit
Jud  Keep yourselves in the love of God looking for life eternal through the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ
Jud  And have pity on those who are in doubt
Jud  And to some give salvation pulling them out of the fire and on some have mercy with fear hating even the clothing which is made unclean by the flesh
Jud  Now to him who is able to keep you from falling and to give you a place in his glory free from all evil with great joy
Jud  To the only God our Saviour through Jesus Christ our Lord let us give glory and honour and authority and power before all time and now and for ever So be it
Rev  The Revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave him so that his servants might have knowledge of the things which will quickly take place and he sent and made it clear by his angel to his servant John
Rev  Who gave witness of the word of God and of the witness of Jesus Christ even of all the things which he saw
Rev  A blessing be on the reader and on those who give ear to the prophets words and keep the things which he has put in the book for the time is near
Rev  John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace to you and peace from him who is and was and is to come and from the seven Spirits which are before his high seat
Rev  And from Jesus Christ the true witness the first to come back from the dead and the ruler of the kings of the earth To him who had love for us and has made us clean from our sins by his blood
Rev  And has made us to be a kingdom and priests to his God and Father to him let glory and power be given for ever and ever So be it
Rev  See he comes with the clouds and every eye will see him and those by whom he was wounded and all the tribes of the earth will be sorrowing because of him Yes so be it
Rev  I am the First and the Last says the Lord God who is and was and is to come the Ruler of all
Rev  I John your brother who have a part with you in the trouble and the kingdom and the quiet strength of Jesus was in the island which is named Patmos for the word of God and the witness of Jesus
Rev  I was in the Spirit on the Lords day and a great voice at my back as of a horn came to my ears
Rev  Saying What you see put in a book and send it to the seven churches to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamos and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea
Rev  And turning to see the voice which said these words to me I saw seven gold vessels with lights burning in them
Rev  And in the middle of them one like a son of man clothed with a robe down to his feet and with a band of gold round his breasts
Rev  And his head and his hair were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire
Rev  And his feet like polished brass as if it had been burned in a fire and his voice was as the sound of great waters
Rev  And he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth came a sharp twoedged sword and his face was like the sun shining in its strength
Rev  And when I saw him I went down on my face at his feet as one dead And he put his right hand on me saying Have no fear I am the first and the last and the Living one
Rev  And I was dead and see I am living for ever and I have the keys of death and of Hell
Rev  Put in writing then the things which you have seen and the things which are and the things which will be after these
Rev  The secret of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand and of the seven gold vessels with burning lights The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven lights are the seven churches
Rev  To the angel of the church in Ephesus say These things says he who has the seven stars in his right hand who is walking in the middle of the seven gold lights
Rev  I have knowledge of your doings and of your hard work and long waiting and that you will not put up with evil men and have put to the test those who say they are Apostles and are not and have seen that they are false
Rev  And you have the power of waiting and have undergone trouble because of my name without weariness
Rev  But I have this against you that you are turned away from your first love
Rev  So keep in mind where you were at first and be changed in heart and do the first works or I will come to you and will take away your light from its place if your hearts are not changed
Rev  But at least you have the credit of hating the works of the Nicolaitans as I do
Rev  He who has ears let him give ear to what the Spirit says to the churches To him who overcomes I will give of the fruit of the tree of life which is in the Paradise of God
Rev  And to the angel of the church in Smyrna say These things says the first and the last who was dead and is living
Rev  I have knowledge of your troubles and how poor you are but you have true wealth and the evil words of those who say they are Jews and are not but are a Synagogue of Satan
Rev  Have no fear of the things which you will have to undergo see the Evil One will send some of you into prison so that you may be put to the test and you will have great trouble for ten days Be true till death and I will give you the crown of life
Rev  He who has ears let him give ear to what the Spirit says to the churches He who overcomes will not come under the power of the second death
Rev  And to the angel of the church in Pergamos say These things says he who has the sharp twoedged sword
Rev  I have knowledge that your livingplace is where Satan has his seat and you are true to my name and were not turned away from your faith in me even in the days of Antipas my true witness who was put to death among you where Satan has his place
Rev  But I have some things against you because you have with you those who keep the teaching of Balaam by whose suggestion Balak made the children of Israel go out of the right way taking food which was offered to false gods and going after the desires of the flesh
Rev  And you have those who keep the teaching of the Nicolaitans
Rev  See then that you have a change of heart or I will come to you quickly and will make war against them with the sword of my mouth
Rev  He who has ears let him give ear to what the Spirit says to the churches To him who overcomes I will give of the secret manna and I will give him a white stone and on the stone a new name of which no one has knowledge but he to whom it is given
Rev  And to the angel of the church in Thyatira say These things says the Son of God whose eyes are like a flame of fire and his feet like polished brass
Rev  I have knowledge of your works and your love and faith and help and strength in trouble and that your last works are more than the first
Rev  But I have this against you that you let the woman Jezebel say she is a prophet and give false teaching making my servants go after the desires of the flesh and take food offered to false gods
Rev  And I gave her time for a change of heart but she has no mind to give up her unclean ways
Rev  See I will put her into a bed and those who make themselves unclean with her into great trouble if they go on with her works
Rev  And I will put her children to death and all the churches will see that I am he who makes search into the secret thoughts and hearts of men and I will give to every one of you the reward of your works
Rev  But to you I say to the rest in Thyatira even to those who have not this teaching and have no knowledge of the secrets of Satan as they say I put on you no other weight
Rev  But what you have keep safe till I come
Rev  He who overcomes and keeps my works to the end to him I will give rule over the nations
Rev  And he will be ruling them with a rod of iron as the vessels of the potter they will be broken even as I have power from my Father
Rev  And I will give him the morning star
Rev  He who has ears let him give ear to what the Spirit says to the churches
Rev  And to the angel of the church in Sardis say These things says he who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars I have knowledge of your works that you seem to be living but are dead
Rev  Be on the watch and make strong the rest of the things which are near to death because as judged by me your works have not come up to Gods measure
Rev  Keep in mind then the teaching which was given to you and be ruled by it and have a change of heart If then you do not keep watch I will come like a thief and you will have no knowledge of the hour when I will come on you
Rev  But you have some names in Sardis who have kept clean their robes and as a reward they will go in white with me
Rev  He who overcomes will be dressed in white and I will not take his name from the book of life and I will give witness to his name before my Father and before his angels
Rev  He who has ears let him give ear to what the Spirit says to the churches
Rev  And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia say These things says he who is holy he who is true he who has the key of David opening the door so that it may be shut by no one and shutting it so that it may be open to no one
Rev  I have knowledge of your works see I have put before you an open door which may be shut by no one and that you have a little strength and have kept my word and have been true to my name
Rev  See I will make those of the Synagogue of Satan who say they are Jews and are not but say what is false I will make them come and give worship before your feet and see my love for you
Rev  Because you have kept my word in quiet strength I will keep you from the hour of testing which is coming on all the world to put to the test those who are on earth
Rev  I come quickly keep that which you have so that no one may take your crown
Rev  Him who overcomes I will make a pillar in the house of my God and he will go out no more and I will put on him the name of my God and the name of the town of my God the new Jerusalem which comes down out of heaven from my God and my new name
Rev  He who has ears let him give ear to what the Spirit says to the churches
Rev  And to the angel of the church in Laodicea say These things says the true and certain witness the head of Gods new order
Rev  I have knowledge of your works that you are not cold or warm it would be better if you were cold or warm
Rev  So because you are not one thing or the other I will have no more to do with you
Rev  For you say I have wealth and have got together goods and land and have need of nothing and you are not conscious of your sad and unhappy condition that you are poor and blind and without clothing
Rev  If you are wise you will get from me gold tested by fire so that you may have true wealth and white robes to put on so that your shame may not be seen and oil for your eyes so that you may see
Rev  To all those who are dear to me I give sharp words and punishment then with all your heart have sorrow for your evil ways
Rev  See I am waiting at the door and giving the sign if my voice comes to any mans ears and he makes the door open I will come in to him and will take food with him and he with me
Rev  To him who overcomes I will give a place with me on my high seat even as I overcame and am seated with my Father on his high seat
Rev  He who has ears let him give ear to what the Spirit says to the churches
Rev  After these things I saw a door open in heaven and the first voice came to my ears like the sound of a horn saying Come up here and I will make clear to you the things which are to come
Rev  Straight away I was in the Spirit and I saw a high seat in heaven and one was seated on it
Rev  And to my eyes he was like a jasper and a sardius stone and there was an arch of light round the high seat like an emerald
Rev  And round about the high seat were four and twenty seats and on them I saw four and twenty rulers seated clothed in white robes and on their heads crowns of gold
Rev  And out of the high seat came flames and voices and thunders And seven lights of fire were burning before the high seat which are the seven Spirits of God
Rev  And before the high seat there was as it seemed a clear sea of glass and in the middle of the high seat and round about it four beasts full of eyes round about
Rev  And the first beast was like a lion and the second like an ox and the third had a face like a man and the fourth was like an eagle in flight
Rev  And the four beasts having every one of them six wings are full of eyes round about and inside and without resting day and night they say Holy holy holy Lord God Ruler of all who was and is and is to come
Rev  And when the beasts give glory and honour to him who is seated on the high seat to him who is living for ever and ever
Rev  The four and twenty rulers go down on their faces before him who is seated on the high seat and give worship to him who is living for ever and ever and take off their crowns before the high seat saying
Rev  It is right our Lord and our God for you to have glory and honour and power because by you were all things made and by your desire they came into being
Rev  And I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the high seat a book with writing inside it and on the back shut with seven stamps of wax
Rev  And I saw a strong angel saying in a loud voice Who is able to make the book open and to undo its stamps
Rev  And no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to get the book open or to see what was in it
Rev  And I was very sad because there was no one able to get the book open or to see what was in it
Rev  And one of the rulers said to me Do not be sad see the Lion of the tribe of Judah the Root of David has overcome and has power to undo the book and its seven stamps
Rev  And I saw in the middle of the high seat and of the four beasts and in the middle of the rulers a Lamb in his place which seemed as if it had been put to death having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven Spirits of God sent out into all the earth
Rev  And he came and took it out of the right hand of him who was seated on the high seat
Rev  And when he had taken the book the four beasts and the four and twenty rulers went down on their faces before the Lamb having every one an instrument of music and gold vessels full of perfumes which are the prayers of the saints
Rev  And their voices are sounding in a new song saying It is right for you to take the book and to make it open for you were put to death and have made an offering to God of your blood for men of every tribe and language and people and nation
Rev  And have made them a kingdom and priests to our God and they are ruling on the earth
Rev  And I saw and there came to my ears the sound of a great number of angels round about the high seat and the beasts and the rulers and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands
Rev  Saying with a great voice It is right to give to the Lamb who was put to death power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and blessing
Rev  And to my ears came the voice of everything in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea and of all things which are in them saying To him who is seated on the high seat and to the Lamb may blessing and honour and glory and power be given for ever and ever
Rev  And the four beasts said So be it And the rulers went down on their faces and gave worship
Rev  And I saw when the Lamb undid one of the stamps and the voice of one of the four beasts came to my ears saying as with a voice of thunder Come and see
Rev  And I saw a white horse and he who was seated on it had a bow and there was given to him a crown and he went out with power to overcome
Rev  And when the second stamp was undone the voice of the second beast came to my ears saying Come and see
Rev  And another horse came out a red horse and it was given to him who was seated on it to take peace from the earth so that people might put one another to death and there was given to him a great sword
Rev  And when the third stamp was undone the voice of the third beast came to my ears saying Come and see And I saw a black horse and he who was seated on it had scales in his hand
Rev  And a voice came to my ears from the middle of the four beasts saying A measure of grain for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see that you do no damage to the oil and the wine
Rev  And when the fourth stamp was undone the voice of the fourth beast came to my ears saying Come and see
Rev  And I saw a grey horse and the name of him who was seated on it was Death and Hell came after him And there was given to them authority over the fourth part of the earth to put to destruction by the sword and by taking away their food and by death and by the beasts of the earth
Rev  And when the fifth stamp was undone I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been put to death for the word of God and for the witness which they kept
Rev  And they gave a great cry saying How long will it be O Ruler holy and true before you take your place as judge and give punishment for our blood to those on the earth
Rev  And there was given to every one a white robe and they were ordered to take their rest for a little time till the number was complete of the other servants their brothers who would be put to death even as they had been
Rev  And I saw when the sixth stamp was undone and there was a great earthshock and the sun became black as haircloth and all the moon became as blood
Rev  And the stars of heaven were falling to the earth like green fruit from a tree before the force of a great wind
Rev  And the heaven was taken away like the roll of a book when it is rolled up and all the mountains and islands were moved out of their places
Rev  And the kings of the earth and the rulers and the chief captains and the men of wealth and the strong and every servant and free man took cover in the holes and the rocks of the mountains
Rev  And they say to the mountains and to the rocks Come down on us covering us from the face of him who is seated on the high seat and from the wrath of the Lamb
Rev  For the great day of their wrath is come and who may keep his place
Rev  After this I saw four angels in their places at the four points of the earth keeping back the four winds in their hands so that there might be no moving of the wind on the earth or on the sea or on any tree
Rev  And I saw another angel coming up from the east having the mark of the living God and he said with a great voice to the four angels to whom it was given to do damage to the earth and the sea
Rev  Do no damage to the earth or the sea or the trees till we have put a mark on the servants of our God
Rev  And there came to my ears the number of those who had the mark on their brows a hundred and fortyfour thousand who were marked out of every tribe of the people of Israel
Rev  Of the tribe of Judah were marked twelve thousand of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand
Rev  Of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand
Rev  Of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand
Rev  Of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand of the tribe of Benjamin were marked twelve thousand
Rev  After these things I saw a great army of people more than might be numbered out of every nation and of all tribes and peoples and languages taking their places before the high seat and before the Lamb dressed in white robes and with branches in their hands
Rev  Saying with a loud voice Salvation to our God who is seated on the high seat and to the Lamb
Rev  And all the angels were round about the high seat and about the rulers and the four beasts and they went down on their faces before the high seat and gave worship to God saying
Rev  So be it Let blessing and glory and wisdom and praise and honour and power and strength be given to our God for ever and ever So be it
Rev  And one of the rulers made answer saying to me These who have on white robes who are they and where did they come from
Rev  And I said to him My lord you have knowledge And he said to me These are they who came through the great testing and their robes have been washed and made white in the blood of the Lamb
Rev  This is why they are before the high seat of God and they are his servants day and night in his house and he who is seated on the high seat will be a tent over them
Rev  They will never be in need of food or drink and they will never again be troubled by the burning heat of the sun
Rev  For the Lamb who is on the high seat will be their keeper and their guide to fountains of living water and God will make glad their eyes for ever
Rev  And when the seventh stamp was undone there was quiet in heaven for about half an hour
Rev  And I saw the seven angels who had their place before God and seven horns were given to them
Rev  And another angel came and took his place at the altar having a gold vessel for burning perfume and there was given to him much perfume so that he might put it with the prayers of all the saints on the gold altar which was before the high seat
Rev  And the smoke of the perfume with the prayers of the saints went up before God out of the angels hand
Rev  And the angel took the vessel and he made it full of the fire of the altar and sent it down on the earth and there came thunders and voices and flames and a shaking of the earth
Rev  And the seven angels who had the seven horns made ready for sounding them
Rev  And at the sounding of the first a rain of ice and fire mixed with blood was sent on the earth and a third part of the earth and of the trees and all green grass was burned up
Rev  And at the sounding of the second angel it was as if a great mountain burning with fire was sent into the sea and a third part of the sea became blood
Rev  And destruction came on a third part of the living things which were in the sea and on a third part of the ships
Rev  And at the sounding of the third angel there went down from heaven a great star burning like a flame and it came on a third part of the rivers and on the fountains of water
Rev  And the name of the star is Wormwood and a third part of the waters became bitter and a number of men came to their end because of the waters for they were made bitter
Rev  And at the sounding of the fourth angel a third part of the sun and of the moon and of the stars was made dark so that there was no light for a third part of the day and of the night
Rev  And there came to my ears the cry of an eagle in flight in the middle of heaven saying with a great voice Trouble trouble trouble to all on the earth because of the other voices of the horns of the three angels whose sounding is still to come
Rev  And at the sounding of the fifth angel I saw a star falling from heaven to the earth and there was given to him the key of the great deep
Rev  And he made the great deep open and a smoke went up from it like the smoke of a great oven and the sun and the air were made dark because of the smoke
Rev  And from the smoke locusts came out on the earth and power was given them like the power of scorpions
Rev  And they were ordered to do no damage to the grass of the earth or any green thing or any tree but only to such men as have not the mark of God on their brows
Rev  And orders were given them not to put them to death but to give them great pain for five months and their pain was as the pain from the wound of a scorpion
Rev  And in those days men will be hoping for death and it will not come to them and they will have a great desire for death and death will go in flight from them
Rev  And the forms of the locusts were like horses made ready for war and on their heads they had crowns like gold and their faces were as the faces of men
Rev  And they had hair like the hair of women and their teeth were as the teeth of lions
Rev  And they had breastplates like iron and the sound of their wings was as the sound of carriages like an army of horses rushing to the fight
Rev  And they have pointed tails like scorpions and in their tails is their power to give men wounds for five months
Rev  They have over them as king the angel of the great deep his name in Hebrew is Abaddon and in the Greek language Apollyon
Rev  The first Trouble is past see there are still two Troubles to come
Rev  And at the sounding of the sixth angel a voice came to my ears from the horns of the gold altar which is before God
Rev  Saying to the sixth angel who had the horn Make free the four angels who are chained at the great river Euphrates
Rev  And the four angels were made free who were ready for the hour and day and month and year that they might put to death a third part of men
Rev  And the number of the armies of the horsemen was twice ten thousand times ten thousand the number of them came to my ears
Rev  And so I saw the horses in the vision and those who were seated on them having breastplates of fire and glass and of burning stone and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions and out of their mouths came fire and smoke and a smell of burning
Rev  By these evils a third part of men was put to death by the fire and the smoke and the burning smell which came out of their mouths
Rev  For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails because their tails are like snakes and have heads and with them they give wounds
Rev  And the rest of the people who were not put to death by these evils were not turned from the works of their hands but went on giving worship to evil spirits and images of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood which have no power of seeing or hearing or walking
Rev  And they had no regret for putting men to death or for their use of secret arts or for the evil desires of the flesh or for taking the property of others
Rev  And I saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven clothed with a cloud and an arch of coloured light was round his head and his face was like the sun and his feet like pillars of fire
Rev  And he had in his hand a little open book and he put his right foot on the sea and his left on the earth
Rev  And he gave a loud cry like the angry voice of a lion and at his cry the voices of the seven thunders were sounding
Rev  And when the seven thunders had given out their voices I was about to put their words down and a voice from heaven came to my ears saying Keep secret the things which the seven thunders said and do not put them in writing
Rev  And the angel which I saw taking his position on the sea and on the earth put up his right hand to heaven
Rev  And took his oath by him who is living for ever and ever who made the heaven and the things in it and the earth and the things in it and the sea and the things in it that there would be no more waiting
Rev  But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when the sound of his horn is about to come then will the secret of God be complete of which he gave the good news to his servants the prophets
Rev  And the voice came to me again from heaven saying Go take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who has his place on the sea and on the earth
Rev  And I went to the angel and said to him Give me the little book And he said to me Put it in your mouth and it will make your stomach bitter but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey
Rev  And I took the little book out of the angels hand and did as he said and it was sweet as honey in my mouth and when I had taken it my stomach was made bitter
Rev  And they said to me You are to give word again of what is coming in the future to the peoples and nations and languages and kings
Rev  And there was given to me a measuring rod and one said Go up and take the measure of the house of God and the altar and the worshippers in it
Rev  But do not take the measure of the space outside the house because it has been given to the nations and the holy town will be under their feet for fortytwo months
Rev  And I will give orders to my two witnesses and they will be prophets for a thousand two hundred and sixty days clothed with haircloth
Rev  These are the two olivetrees and the two lights which are before the Lord of the earth
Rev  And if any man would do them damage fire comes out of their mouth and puts an end to those who are working against them and if any man has a desire to do them damage in this way will he be put to death
Rev  These have the power to keep the heaven shut so that there may be no rain in the days when they are prophets and they have power over the waters to make them into blood and to send every sort of disease on the earth as their pleasure is
Rev  And when they have come to the end of their witness the beast which comes up out of the great deep will make war on them and overcome them and put them to death
Rev  And their dead bodies will be in the open street of the great town which in the spirit is named Sodom and Egypt where their Lord was put to death on the cross
Rev  And the peoples and tribes and languages and nations will be looking on their dead bodies three days and a half and will not let their dead bodies be put in the earth
Rev  And those who are on the earth will have pleasure and delight over them and they will send offerings one to another because these two prophets gave great trouble to all on the earth
Rev  And after three days and a half the breath of life from God went into them and they got up on their feet and great fear came on those who saw them
Rev  And a great voice from heaven came to their ears saying to them Come up here And they went up into heaven in the cloud and were seen by those desiring their death
Rev  And in that hour there was a great earthshock and a tenth part of the town came to destruction and in the earthshock seven thousand persons came to their end and the rest were in fear and gave glory to the God of heaven
Rev  The second Trouble is past see the third Trouble comes quickly
Rev  And at the sounding of the seventh angel there were great voices in heaven saying The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ and he will have rule for ever and ever
Rev  And the four and twenty rulers who are seated before God on their high seats went down on their faces and gave worship to God saying
Rev  We give you praise O Lord God Ruler of all who is and who was because you have taken up your great power and are ruling your kingdom
Rev  And the nations were angry and your wrath has come and the time for the dead to be judged and the time of reward for your servants the prophets and for the saints and for those in whom is the fear of your name small and great and the time of destruction for those who made the earth unclean
Rev  And the house of God which is in heaven was open and the ark of his agreement was seen in his house and there were flames and voices and thunders and an earthshock and a rain of ice
Rev  And a great sign was seen in heaven a A woman clothed with the sun and with the moon under her feet and on her head a crown of twelve stars
Rev  And she was with child and she gave a cry in the pains of childbirth
Rev  And there was seen another sign in heaven a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and on his heads seven crowns
Rev  And his tail was pulling a third part of the stars of heaven down to the earth and the dragon took his place before the woman who was about to give birth so that when the birth had taken place he might put an end to her child
Rev  And she gave birth to a son a male child who was to have rule over all the nations with a rod of iron and her child was taken up to God and to his high seat
Rev  And the woman went in flight to the waste land where she has a place made ready by God so that there they may give her food a thousand two hundred and sixty days
Rev  And there was war in heaven Michael and his angels going out to the fight with the dragon and the dragon and his angels made war
Rev  And they were overcome and there was no more place for them in heaven
Rev  And the great dragon was forced down the old snake who is named the Evil One and Satan by whom all the earth is turned from the right way he was forced down to the earth and his angels were forced down with him
Rev  And a great voice in heaven came to my ears saying Now is come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ because he who says evil against our brothers before our God day and night is forced down
Rev  And they overcame him through the blood of the Lamb and the word of their witness and loving not their lives they freely gave themselves up to death
Rev  Be glad then O heavens and you who are in them But there is trouble for the earth and the sea because the Evil One has come down to you being very angry having the knowledge that he has but a short time
Rev  And when the dragon saw that he was forced down to the earth he made cruel attacks on the woman who gave birth to the male child
Rev  And there were given to the woman two wings of a great eagle so that she might go in flight into the waste land to her place where she is given food for a time and times and half a time from the face of the snake
Rev  And the snake sent out of his mouth after the woman a river of water so that she might be taken away by the stream
Rev  And the earth gave help to the woman and with open mouth took up the river which the dragon sent out of his mouth
Rev  And the dragon was angry with the woman and went away to make war on the rest of her seed who keep the orders of God and the witness of Jesus
Rev  And he took his place on the sand of the sea And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea having ten horns and seven heads and on his horns ten crowns and on his heads unholy names
Rev  And the beast which I saw was like a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority
Rev  And I saw one of his heads as if it had been given a deathwound and his deathwound was made well and all the earth was wondering at the beast
Rev  And they gave worship to the dragon because he gave authority to the beast and worshipping the beast they said Who is like the beast and who is able to go to war with him
Rev  And there was given to him a mouth to say words of pride against God and there was given to him authority to go on for fortytwo months
Rev  And his mouth was open to say evil against God and against his name and his Tent even against those who are in heaven
Rev  And it was given to him to make war on the saints and to overcome them and there was given to him authority over every tribe and people and language and nation
Rev  And all who are on the earth will give him worship everyone whose name has not been from the first in the book of life of the Lamb who was put to death
Rev  If any man has ears let him give ear
Rev  If any man sends others into prison into prison he will go if any man puts to death with the sword with the sword will he be put to death Here is the quiet strength and the faith of the saints
Rev  And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and his voice was like that of a dragon
Rev  And he makes use of all the authority of the first beast before his eyes And he makes the earth and those who are in it give worship to the first beast whose deathwound was made well
Rev  And he does great signs even making fire come down from heaven on the earth before the eyes of men
Rev  And those who are on the earth are turned from the true way by him through the signs which he was given power to do before the beast giving orders to those who are on the earth to make an image to the beast who was wounded by the sword and came to life
Rev  And he had power to give breath to the image of the beast so that words might come from the image of the beast and that he might have all those who did not give worship to the image of the beast put to death
Rev  And he gives to all small and great the poor and those who have wealth the free and those who are not free a mark on their right hand or on their brows
Rev  So that no man might be able to do trade but he who has the mark even the name of the beast or the number of his name
Rev  Here is wisdom He who has knowledge let him get the number of the beast because it is the number of a man and his number is Six hundred and sixtysix
Rev  And I saw the Lamb on the mountain of Zion and with him a hundred and fortyfour thousand marked on their brows with his name and the name of his Father
Rev  And a voice from heaven came to my ears like the sound of great waters and the sound of loud thunder and the voice which came to me was like the sound of players playing on instruments of music
Rev  And they made as it seemed a new song before the high seat and before the four beasts and the rulers and no man might have knowledge of the song but the hundred and fortyfour thousand even those from the earth whom God has made his for a price
Rev  These are they who have not made themselves unclean with women for they are virgins These are they who go after the Lamb wherever he goes These were taken from among men to be the first fruits to God and to the Lamb
Rev  And in their mouth there was no false word for they are untouched by evil
Rev  And I saw another angel in flight between heaven and earth having eternal good news to give to those who are on the earth and to every nation and tribe and language and people
Rev  Saying with a loud voice Have fear of God and give him glory because the hour of his judging is come and give worship to him who made heaven and earth and the sea and the fountains of water
Rev  And a second angel came after saying Destruction has come to Babylon the great which gave to all the nations the wine of the wrath of her evil ways
Rev  And a third angel came after them saying with a loud voice If any man gives worship to the beast and his image and has his mark on his brow or on his hand
Rev  To him will be given of the wine of Gods wrath which is ready unmixed in the cup of his wrath and he will have cruel pain burning with fire before the holy angels and before the Lamb
Rev  And the smoke of their pain goes up for ever and ever and they have no rest day and night who give worship to the beast and his image and have on them the mark of his name
Rev  Here is the quiet strength of the saints who keep the orders of God and the faith of Jesus
Rev  And a voice from heaven came to my ears saying Put in writing There is a blessing on the dead who from now on come to their end in the Lord yes says the Spirit that they may have rest from their troubles for their works go with them
Rev  And I saw a white cloud and on the cloud I saw one seated like a son of man having on his head a crown of gold and in his hand a sharp curved blade
Rev  And another angel came out from the house of God crying with a loud voice to him who was seated on the cloud Put in your blade and let the grain be cut because the hour for cutting it is come for the grain of the earth is overready
Rev  And he who was seated on the cloud sent in his blade on the earth and the grain of the earth was cut
Rev  And another angel came out from the house of God which is in heaven having a sharp curved blade
Rev  And another angel came out from the altar who has power over fire and he gave a loud cry to him who had the sharp curved blade saying Put in your sharp blade and let the grapes of the vine of the earth be cut for her grapes are fully ready
Rev  And the angel sent his blade into the earth and the vine of the earth was cut and he put it into the great winecrusher of the wrath of God
Rev  And the grapes were crushed under foot outside the town and blood came out from them even to the headbands of the horses two hundred miles
Rev  And I saw another sign in heaven great and strange seven angels having the seven last punishments for in them the wrath of God is complete
Rev  And I saw a sea which seemed like glass mixed with fire and those who had overcome the beast and his image and the number of his name were in their places by the sea of glass with Gods instruments of music in their hands
Rev  And they give the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the Lamb saying Great and full of wonder are your works O Lord God Ruler of all true and full of righteousness are your ways eternal King
Rev  What man is there who will not have fear before you O Lord and give glory to your name because you only are holy for all the nations will come and give worship before you for your righteousness has been made clear
Rev  And after these things I saw and the house of the Tent of witness in heaven was open
Rev  And the seven angels who had the seven punishments came out from the house of God clothed with linen clean and bright and with bands of gold about their breasts
Rev  And one of the four beasts gave to the seven angels seven gold vessels full of the wrath of God who is living for ever and ever
Rev  And the house of God was full of smoke from the glory of God and from his power and no one was able to go into the house of God till the seven punishments of the seven angels were ended
Rev  And a great voice out of the house of God came to my ears saying to the seven angels Go and let that which is in the seven vessels of the wrath of God come down on the earth
Rev  And the first went and let what was in his vessel come down on the earth and it became an evil poisoning wound on the men who had the mark of the beast and who gave worship to his image
Rev  And the second let what was in his vessel come out into the sea and it became blood as of a dead man and every living thing in the sea came to an end
Rev  And the third let what was in his vessel come out into the rivers and the fountains of water and they became blood
Rev  And the voice of the angel of the waters came to my ears saying True and upright is your judging O Holy One who is and was from all time
Rev  For they made the blood of saints and prophets come out like a stream and blood have you given them for drink which is their right reward
Rev  And a voice came from the altar saying Even so O Lord God Ruler of all true and full of righteousness is your judging
Rev  And the fourth let what was in his vessel come out on the sun and power was given to it that men might be burned with fire
Rev  And men were burned with great heat and they said evil things against the name of the God who has authority over these punishments and they were not turned from their evil ways to give him glory
Rev  And the fifth let what was in his vessel come out on the high seat of the beast and his kingdom was made dark and they were biting their tongues for pain
Rev  And they said evil things against the God of heaven because of their pain and their wounds and they were not turned from their evil works
Rev  And the sixth let what was in his vessel come out on the great river Euphrates and it became dry so that the way might be made ready for the kings from the east
Rev  And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet three unclean spirits like frogs
Rev  For they are evil spirits working signs who go out even to the kings of all the earth to get them together to the war of the great day of God the Ruler of all
Rev  See I come as a thief Happy is he who is watching and keeps his robes so that he may not go unclothed and his shame be seen
Rev  And they got them together into the place which is named in Hebrew Armageddon
Rev  And the seventh let what was in his vessel come out on the air and there came out a great voice from the house of God from the high seat saying It is done
Rev  And there were flames and voices and thunders and there was a great earthshock so that never from the time when men were on the earth had there been so great an earthshock so full of power
Rev  And the great town was cut into three parts and the towns of the nations came to destruction and Babylon the great came into mind before God to be given the cup of the wine of his wrath
Rev  And every island went in flight and the mountains were seen no longer
Rev  And great drops of ice every one about the weight of a talent came down out of heaven on men and men said evil things against God because of the punishment of the icedrops for it is very great
Rev  And one of the seven angels who had the seven vessels came and said to me Come here so that you may see the judging of the evil woman who is seated on the great waters
Rev  With whom the kings of the earth made themselves unclean and those who are on the earth were full of the wine of her evil desires
Rev  And he took me away in the Spirit into a waste land and I saw a woman seated on a bright red beast full of evil names having seven heads and ten horns
Rev  And the woman was clothed in purple and bright red with ornaments of gold and stones of great price and jewels and in her hand was a gold cup full of evil things and her unclean desires
Rev  And on her brow was a name SECRET BABYLON THE GREAT THE MOTHER OF THE EVIL WOMEN AND OF THE UNCLEAN THINGS OF THE EARTH
Rev  And I saw the woman overcome as with the wine of the blood of the saints and the blood of those put to death because of Jesus And when I saw her I was overcome with a great wonder
Rev  And the angel said to me Why were you surprised I will make clear to you the secret of the woman and of the beast on which she is seated which has the seven heads and the ten horns
Rev  The beast which you saw was and is not and is about to come up out of the great deep and to go into destruction And those who are on the earth whose names have not been put in the book of life from the first will be full of wonder when they see the beast that he was and is not and still will be
Rev  Here is the mind which has wisdom The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated
Rev  And they are seven kings the five have come to an end the one is the other has not come and when he comes he will have to go on for a little time
Rev  And the beast which was and is not is himself the eighth and is of the seven and he goes into destruction
Rev  And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings which still have been given no kingdom but they are given authority as kings with the beast for one hour
Rev  These have one mind and they give their power and authority to the beast
Rev  These will make war against the Lamb and the Lamb will overcome them because he is the Lord of lords and King of kings and those who are with him are named marked out and true
Rev  And he said to me The waters which you saw where the evil woman is seated are peoples and armies and nations and languages
Rev  And the ten horns which you saw and the beast these will be turned against the evil woman and will make her waste and uncovered and will take her flesh for food and will have her burned with fire
Rev  Because God has put it in their hearts to do his purpose and to be of one mind giving their kingdom to the beast till the words of God have effect and are complete
Rev  And the woman whom you saw is the great town which is ruling over the kings of the earth
Rev  After these things I saw another angel coming down out of heaven having great authority and the earth was bright with his glory
Rev  And he gave a loud cry saying Babylon the great has come down from her high place she has come to destruction and has become a place of evil spirits and of every unclean spirit and a hole for every unclean and hated bird
Rev  For through the wine of the wrath of her evil desires all the nations have come to destruction and the kings of the earth made themselves unclean with her and the traders of the earth had their wealth increased by the power of her evil ways
Rev  And another voice from heaven came to my ears saying Come out of her my people so that you may have no part in her sins and in her punishments
Rev  For her sins have gone up even to heaven and God has taken note of her evildoing
Rev  Give to her as she gave even an increased reward for her works in the cup which was mixed by her let there be mixed as much again for herself
Rev  As she gave glory to herself and became more evil in her ways in the same measure give her pain and weeping for she says in her heart I am seated here a queen and am no widow and will in no way see sorrow
Rev  For this reason in one day will her troubles come death and sorrow and need of food and she will be completely burned with fire for strong is the Lord God who is her judge
Rev  And the kings of the earth who made themselves unclean with her and in her company gave themselves up to evil will be weeping and crying over her when they see the smoke of her burning
Rev  Watching from far away for fear of her punishment saying Sorrow sorrow for Babylon the great town the strong town for in one hour you have been judged
Rev  And the traders of the earth are weeping and crying over her because no man has any more desire for their goods
Rev  Gold and silver and stones of great price and jewels and delicate linen and robes of purple and silk and red and perfumed wood and every vessel of ivory and every vessel made of fair wood and of brass and iron and stone
Rev  And sweetsmelling plants and perfumes and wine and oil and well crushed grain and cattle and sheep and horses and carriages and servants and souls of men
Rev  And the fruit of your souls desire has gone from you and all things delicate and shining have come to an end and will never again be seen
Rev  The traders in these things by which their wealth was increased will be watching far off for fear of her punishment weeping and crying
Rev  Saying Sorrow sorrow for the great town she who was clothed in delicate linen and purple and red with ornaments of gold and stones of great price and jewels
Rev  For in one hour such great wealth has come to nothing And every shipmaster and all who are sailing on the sea and sailors and all who get their living by the sea were watching from far away
Rev  And crying out when they saw the smoke of her burning saying What town is like the great town
Rev  And they put dust on their heads and were sad weeping and crying and saying Sorrow sorrow for the great town in which was increased the wealth of all who had their ships on the sea because of her great stores for in one hour she is made waste
Rev  Be glad over her heaven and you saints and Apostles and prophets because she has been judged by God on your account
Rev  And a strong angel took up a stone like the great stone with which grain is crushed and sent it into the sea saying So with a great fall will Babylon the great town come to destruction and will not be seen any more at all
Rev  And the voice of players and makers of music will never again be sounding in you and no worker expert in art will ever again be living in you and there will be no sound of the crushing of grain any more at all in you
Rev  And never again will the shining of lights be seen in you and the voice of the newlymarried man and the bride will never again be sounding in you for your traders were the lords of the earth and by your evil powers were all the nations turned out of the right way
Rev  And in her was seen the blood of prophets and of saints and of all who have been put to death on the earth
Rev  After these things there came to my ears a sound like the voice of a great band of people in heaven saying Praise to the Lord salvation and glory and power be to our God
Rev  For true and upright are his decisions for by him has the evil woman been judged who made the earth unclean with the sins of her body and he has given her punishment for the blood of his servants
Rev  And again they said Praise to the Lord And her smoke went up for ever and ever
Rev  And the four and twenty rulers and the four beasts went down on their faces and gave worship to God who was seated on the high seat saying Even so praise to the Lord
Rev  And a voice came from the high seat saying Give praise to our God all you his servants small and great in whom is the fear of him
Rev  And there came to my ears the voice of a great army like the sound of waters and the sound of loud thunders saying Praise to the Lord for the Lord our God Ruler of all is King
Rev  Let us be glad with delight and let us give glory to him because the time is come for the Lamb to be married and his wife has made herself ready
Rev  And to her it was given to be clothed in delicate linen clean and shining for the clean linen is the righteousness of the saints
Rev  And he said to me Put in the book Happy are the guests at the bridefeast of the Lamb And he said to me These are the true words of God
Rev  And I went on my face before his feet to give him worship And he said to me See you do it not I am a brotherservant with you and with your brothers who keep the witness of Jesus give worship to God for the witness of Jesus is the spirit of the prophets word
Rev  And the heaven was open and I saw a white horse and he who was seated on it was named Certain and True and he is judging and making war in righteousness
Rev  And his eyes are a flame of fire and crowns are on his head and he has a name in writing of which no man has knowledge but himself
Rev  And he is clothed in a robe washed with blood and his name is The Word of God
Rev  And the armies which are in heaven went after him on white horses clothed in delicate linen white and clean
Rev  And out of his mouth comes a sharp sword with which he overcomes the nations and he has rule over them with a rod of iron and he is crushing with his feet the grapes of the strong wrath of God the Ruler of all
Rev  And on his robe and on his leg is a name KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS
Rev  And I saw an angel taking his place in the sun and he was crying with a loud voice saying to all the birds in flight in the heavens Come together to the great feast of God
Rev  So that you may take for your food the flesh of kings and of captains and of strong men and of horses and of those who are seated on them and the flesh of all men free and unfree small and great
Rev  And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies come together to make war against him who was seated on the horse and against his army
Rev  And the beast was taken and with him the false prophet who did the signs before him by which they were turned from the true way who had the mark of the beast and who gave worship to his image these two were put living into the sea of everburning fire
Rev  And the rest were put to death with the sword of him who was on the horse even the sword which came out of his mouth and all the birds were made full with their flesh
Rev  And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven having the key of the great deep and a great chain in his hand
Rev  And he took the dragon the old snake which is the Evil One and Satan and put chains on him for a thousand years
Rev  And put him into the great deep and it was shut and locked over him so that he might put the nations in error no longer till the thousand years were ended after this he will be let loose for a little time
Rev  And I saw high seats and they were seated on them and the right of judging was given to them and I saw the souls of those who were put to death for the witness of Jesus and for the word of God and those who did not give worship to the beast or to his image and had not his mark on their brows or on their hands and they were living and ruling with Christ a thousand years
Rev  The rest of the dead did not come to life again till the thousand years were ended This is the first coming back from the dead
Rev  Happy and holy is he who has a part in this first coming over these the second death has no authority but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will be ruling with him a thousand years
Rev  And when the thousand years are ended Satan will be let loose out of his prison
Rev  And will go out to put in error the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth Gog and Magog to get them together to the war the number of whom is like the sands of the sea
Rev  And they went up over the face of the earth and made a circle about the tents of the saints and the well loved town and fire came down out of heaven for their destruction
Rev  And the Evil One who put them in error was sent down into the sea of everburning fire where the beast and the false prophet are and their punishment will go on day and night for ever and ever
Rev  And I saw a great white seat and him who was seated on it before whose face the earth and the heaven went in flight and there was no place for them
Rev  And I saw the dead great and small taking their places before the high seat and the books were open and another book was open which is the book of life and the dead were judged by the things which were in the books even by their works
Rev  And the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and Hell gave up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man by his works
Rev  And death and Hell were put into the sea of fire This is the second death even the sea of fire
Rev  And if anyones name was not in the book of life he went down into the sea of fire
Rev  And I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were gone and there was no more sea
Rev  And I saw the holy town new Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God like a bride made beautiful for her husband
Rev  And there came to my ears a great voice out of the high seat saying See the Tent of God is with men and he will make his livingplace with them and they will be his people and God himself will be with them and be their God
Rev  And he will put an end to all their weeping and there will be no more death or sorrow or crying or pain for the first things have come to an end
Rev  And he who is seated on the high seat said See I make all things new And he said Put it in the book for these words are certain and true
Rev  And he said to me It is done I am the First and the Last the start and the end I will freely give of the fountain of the water of life to him who is in need
Rev  He who overcomes will have these things for his heritage and I will be his God and he will be my son
Rev  But those who are full of fear and without faith the unclean and takers of life those who do the sins of the flesh and those who make use of evil powers or who give worship to images and all those who are false will have their part in the sea of everburning fire which is the second death
Rev  And one of the seven angels who had the seven vessels in which were the seven last punishments came and said to me Come here and see the bride the Lambs wife
Rev  And he took me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain and let me see the holy town Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God
Rev  Having the glory of God and her light was like a stone of great price a jasper stone clear as glass
Rev  She had a wall great and high with twelve doors and at the doors twelve angels and names on them which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel
Rev  And on the east were three doors and on the north three doors and on the south three doors and on the west three doors
Rev  And the wall of the town had twelve bases and on them the twelve names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb
Rev  And he who was talking with me had a gold measuringrod to take the measure of the town and of its doors and its wall
Rev  And the town is square as wide as it is long and he took the measure of the town with the rod one thousand and five hundred miles it is equally long and wide and high
Rev  And he took the measure of its wall one hundred and fortyfour cubits after the measure of a man that is of an angel
Rev  And the building of its wall was of jasper and the town was clear gold clear as glass
Rev  The bases of the wall of the town had ornaments of all sorts of beautiful stones The first base was jasper the second sapphire the third chalcedony the fourth emerald
Rev  The fifth sardonyx the sixth sardius the seventh chrysolite the eighth beryl the ninth topaz the tenth chrysoprase the eleventh jacinth the twelfth amethyst
Rev  And the twelve doors were twelve pearls every door was made of one pearl and the street of the town was clear gold as clear as glass
Rev  And I saw no Temple there because the Lord God the Ruler of all and the Lamb are its Temple
Rev  And the town has no need of the sun or of the moon to give it light for the glory of God did make it light and the light of it is the Lamb
Rev  And the nations will go in its light and the kings of the earth will take their glory into it
Rev  And the doors of it will never be shut by day for there is no night there
Rev  And the glory and honour of the nations will come into it
Rev  And nothing unclean may come into it or anyone whose works are cursed or false but only those whose names are in the Lambs book of life
Rev  And I saw a river of water of life clear as glass coming out of the high seat of God and of the Lamb
Rev  In the middle of its street And on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life having twelve sorts of fruits giving its fruit every month and the leaves of the tree give life to the nations
Rev  And there will be no more curse and the high seat of God and of the Lamb will be there and his servants will be worshipping him
Rev  And they will see his face and his name will be on their brows
Rev  And there will be no more night and they have no need of a light or of the shining of the sun for the Lord God will give them light and they will be ruling for ever and ever
Rev  And he said to me These words are certain and true and the Lord the God of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to make clear to his servants the things which are now to come about
Rev  See I come quickly A blessing on him who keeps the words of this book of the prophet
Rev  And I John am he who saw these things and to whose ears they came And when I had seen and given ear I went down on my face to give worship at the feet of the angel who made these things clear to me
Rev  And he said to me See you do it not I am a brotherservant with you and with your brothers the prophets and with those who keep the words of this book give worship to God
Rev  And he said to me Let not the words of this prophets book be kept secret because the time is near
Rev  Let the evil man go on in his evil and let the unclean be still unclean and let the upright go on in his righteousness and let the holy be holy still
Rev  See I come quickly and my reward is with me to give to every man the outcome of his works
Rev  I am the First and the Last the start and the end
Rev  A blessing on those whose robes are washed so that they may have a right to the tree of life and may go in by the doors into the town
Rev  Outside are the dogs and those who make use of evil powers those who make themselves unclean and the takers of life and those who give worship to images and everyone whose delight is in what is false
Rev  I Jesus have sent my angel to give witness to you of these things in the churches I am the root and the offspring of David the bright and morning star
Rev  And the Spirit and the bride say Come And let him who gives ear say Come And let him who is in need come and let everyone desiring it take of the water of life freely
Rev  For I say to every man to whose ears have come the words of this prophets book If any man makes an addition to them God will put on him the punishments which are in this book
Rev  And if any man takes away from the words of this book God will take away from him his part in the tree of life and the holy town even the things which are in this book
Rev  He who gives witness to these things says Truly I come quickly Even so come Lord Jesus
Rev  The grace of the Lord Jesus be with the saints So be it
